      <p>The Panhellenic Association (Panhel) is the coordinating, student organization for sororities at the University of Michigan. Panhel grew out of a need for a body to oversee and regulate Rush, the recruitment of new members by sororities, in the early 1900s, and its concerns have gradually expanded over the years to include promotion of sorority cooperation and maintenance of high sorority standards. "As a student accepts membership in a sorority," notes one writer, "she also becomes a member of the total Panhellenic effort." (Box 8, f: Brochures, " <title render="italic">Sorority Houses: A Historical Perspective</title>," 1983)</p>
      <p>The first sorority at the University of Michigan was founded in 1879. By 1904, there were nine sororities established on campus, and "the need to establish basic group regulations for rushing was an urgent problem." (<title render="italic">The University of Michigan: An Encyclopedic Survey</title>, Vol. 4, p. 1805) One of these original regulations stipulated that meetings of the Inter-Sorority Association, which later became Panhel, were to be held during the rushing season. From this early organization, Panhel grew into an organization with year-round responsibilities.</p>
      <p>The internal structure of Panhel has varied over the years, but the two decision-making bodies have been the Executive Council and the Panhellenic Council. The members of the Executive Council are the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and committee chairmen. According to the 1981 Constitution, the responsibilities of this council are to administer Rush and to serve as the judicial body of Panhel in instances of constitution violation. (Box 1, f: History and Constitution, "Constitution of the University of Michigan Women's Panhellenic Association of the National Panhellenic Conference (Amended 1981)")</p>
      <p>The Panhellenic Council is the administrative body of Panhel and is composed of the Executive Council members and one representative from each sorority. It is the responsibility of this council, according to the 1981 Constitution, "to administer all business related to the overall welfare of The University of Michigan Women's Panhellenic Association and to compile rules governing the Panhellenic Association, including rushing and pledging, which do not violate the sovereignty, rights, and privileges of member fraternities." The Panhellenic Council was previously named the Presidents' Council and consisted of the Executive Council and the presidents of each sorority. At some point after the name was changed to Panhellenic Council, the Gavel Club was organized. The Gavel Club is an advisory group consisting of all sorority presidents who meet to discuss common problems and strengthen relations between houses. Overseeing and supervising all of Panhellenic activities is the Panhellenic Advisor, a university staff member. The Persephones Consilium, a group of sorority alumnae and active members, is responsible for hiring and supervising the Panhellenic Advisor.</p>
      <p>The Executive Council and the Panhellenic Council meet weekly to discuss events and activities of interest to all sororities, including Rush, Greek Week, social activities, academic requirements, and Ann Arbor community relations. Rush is a series of social events designed to bring sorority members and prospective members together and formally occurs twice a year at the beginning of the fall and winter semesters. The Panhellenic Council is responsible for devising and distributing Rush rules for each Rush period. Greek Week is "a tradition that began in 1940 as a two day conference for new fraternity initiates as a way to educate them about fraternity life... In 1979, after being dormant for twenty years, Greek Week re-emerged. Greeks were reunited in a week of activities devoted to raising money for charity". (Box 8, f: Brochures, "Rush," 1986) Greek Week occurs in the Spring of each academic year.</p>

      <p>The records of the Panhellenic Association (Panhel) measure 7.5 linear feet and include one outsize scrapbook and an outsize folder. The records date from 1945 to 1991 and consist of meeting minutes, annual officers' reports, newspaper clippings, photographs, printed materials, and posters. Despite the range of years covered by the collection as a whole, no one time period is completely documented. For additional information on the history of Panhel, the researcher should consult the folders under the heading "Sororities" in the University of Michigan Library Clipping File and the folder "Panhellenic" in the Vertical File at the Bentley Historical Library.</p>
      <p>The records of Panhel are divided into six series: Topical Files, President's Reports, Scrapbooks, Photographs, Printed Materials, and Posters and Broadsides.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series (1 linear foot) is arranged alphabetically and consists primarily of materials relating to the activities of Panhel within the university's Greek system. The "Meeting Minutes" folders comprise the bulk of this series and contain the most detailed information regarding issues and concerns facing Panhel. For general information, the "History and Constitution" folder contains descriptive articles and other background material on Panhel, including different versions of the constitution. The "Award Applications" folders offer information regarding community service and philanthropic activities of both Panhel and individual sororities. Also of interest are the "Surveys, Questionnaires, and Evaluations" folders which summarize prevailing campus attitudes toward sororities. The "Membership Selection" folder, received in the 1992 accession, focuses on racial discrimination in the Greek system at the University of Michigan.</p>

          <p>The President's Reports series (4 linear feet) is comprised of both unbound materials (dating primarily from 1956/57 to 1965/66) and nine bound volumes (covering the years 1959/60 to 1963/64). The title of this series is slightly misleading; an annual report is actually prepared by each executive officer of Panhel summarizing their experiences and achievements. The unbound reports consist only of these annual reports. The bound materials are extensive and include a wide variety of materials from each given year, such as meeting minutes, constitution and bylaws, newsclippings, and invitations to social events. Because the bound reports are so comprehensive, they are one of the best sources of information on Panhellenic activities and policies.</p>

          <p>The Scrapbooks series (1 linear foot) consists of three scrapbooks for the years 1945-1949, 1966-1968, and 1973-1978. The scrapbooks contain interesting clippings regarding all aspects of sorority life and Panhellenic activities, such as Greek Week, Rush and other social events, but also cover such issues as racial discrimination in sororities. The magazine and newspaper clippings come from a variety of publications, but most frequently from The Michigan Daily, the university's student newspaper.</p>
