          <p>The Unit Publications series contains printed material published specifically by the Housing Division. These publications are defined as being widely distributed and may be published at regular intervals. They are arranged by genre of the publication.</p>
          <p>The Unit Publications series (4.8 linear feet) includes scattered annual reports dating from 1940 to 1987 with the bulk of the reports from 1940 to 1950 and 1969 to 1987. Brochures include information about apartment leases, costs for student housing, Michigan Learning Communities, off-campus housing, and Spring-Summer housing. The bulletins document all aspects of housing both on campus and off, including campus housing from 1978 to 1984. These bulletins include descriptions of the various dormitories and other residence programs, such as language houses, Honors Program, or specialized housing such as the Lawyers Club or Martha Cook residences. The <title render="italic">Living at Michigan</title> bulletins discuss the various dormitories and residence programs as well as roommates, meal plans, and disabilities and special medical conditions.</p>
          <p>The directories include residence education staff directories dating from 1980 to 1990. These directories list the resident directors and advisors for each dorm on campus. The <title render="italic">Residence Hall Telephone Directories</title> list each student residing in the residence halls, their address and telephone number. These directories cover 1990 and 1993 through 1995. There are job descriptions of positions available to students within the Housing Division. They document the period from 1987 to 1993.</p>
          <p>This series contains a history of the division <title render="italic">The Housing of Students</title>, published in 1979. This booklet is divided into three sections with contributions by Peter A. Ostafin (<title render="italic">Residence Halls for Men: The Michigan House Plan</title>, from <title render="italic">The University of Michigan, an Encyclopedic Survey</title>, 1958), (Ruth Gjelsness (<title render="italic">Housing of Women Students</title> from <title render="italic">The University of Michigan, an Encyclopedic Survey</title>, 1958), and Edward C. Salowitz (<title render="italic">Later Years: Physical Growth and Expansion</title>, from <title render="italic">The University of Michigan, an Encyclopedic Survey</title>, 1979). It provides a comprehensive view of housing at the University of Michigan focusing on the programmatic aspects of housing, only incidentally touching on the construction of housing units.</p>
          <p>There is an extensive collection of manuals arranged alphabetically by title. These include handbooks for student athletes and coaches covering the period from 1988 to 1992. These manuals are entitled <title render="italic">The Housing Division and Student Athletes</title> published from 1988 to 1990 and <title render="italic">Athletic Department/Housing Division Handbook: A Resource Guide for the Athletics Department Coaches and Staff</title> issued in 1991 and 1992. The <title render="italic">Bulletin of Information: Residence Halls Policies and Procedures</title>, covering the period from 1976 to 1983 and 1993 to 1996, gives detailed information on alcohol abuse prevention, non-discrimination policies, parking, as well as, housing leases, and procedures governing meal tickets, payments, and student records. The <title render="italic">Community Living at Michigan</title> ([1994/95]-1998/99) describes the judicial procedures for students living in the residence halls including the Michigan Philosophy, the resident Bill of Rights, the community living standards, and lease terms and conditions. For earlier information about the student code of contact consult the <title render="italic">Residence Hall Judicial Process: A Handbook for Students</title> (1993/94) found under the heading "Office of Student Relations." There are also manuals dealing with crisis intervention, discrimination, safety and security, and sexual assault intervention. In addition, the researcher will find guides to residence hall education, programming, and move-in information.</p>
          <p>Newsletters include the <title render="italic">Housing Bulletin</title>, published from 1972 to 1992 for the residents of the various dormitories and the staff of the housing division. This newsletter includes information about the university in general and specific information about housing in particular, including articles about security, safety, special programs, research findings, and historical tidbits about the university. The <title render="italic">Housing Bulletin</title>'s special Diversity Day editions, dated 1989 through 1993, are also included. <title render="italic">Leased-Wise</title> was published from 1975 to 1993 to help foster communication with the off-campus community. The articles focused on that community's concerns with discussions of tenant tax rebates, mediation services, health service, security deposits, and subletting.</p>
          <p>Reports include the 1983 report of the Alcohol Task Force regarding the role of the Housing Division in the prevention of alcohol abuse. In 1983 the Housing Division sponsored a survey to learn the needs and expectations of incoming students and to determine whether or not those needs were met. The results of this survey were published in an in-house publication entitled <title render="italic">The 1983 Residence Halls Survey: Preliminary Report</title>. There are numerous other reports, statistics, and surveys describing the development and history of the residence halls and other university-owned housing as well as the services offered by the Housing Division.</p>

These offices within the Housing Division published annual reports, brochures, manuals, and newsletters documenting their functions.</p>
          <p>The family housing bulletins (scattered issues from 1977 to 1995) include floor plans of the various apartments with application, lease, and community information. <title render="italic">Family Housing News</title> (1979-1982) and <title render="italic">The Community Focus</title> newsletter (1981-1995) document the activities of and programs for the residents, and help keep residents informed about policy and personnel changes in the Housing Division.</p>

These reports also include information about housing utilities and energy usage and housing goals to conserve water and energy.

Of special interest are the publications created by the students and resident employees of the various dorms. Found under the heading "Residence Halls' these publications include anthologies, brochures, manuals and handbooks, and newsletters. All residence halls are represented.

          <p>Created in May 1989, the University Task Force on Faculty, Staff and Student Housing Issues released their interim and final reports in 1990. The task force mission was to study the university's role with regard to undergraduate, graduate, faculty, and staff housing, and its relationship to the broader Ann Arbor community, and to recommend how the university could enrich the educational and community-building potential of the housing environment. The interim reports and final report include results of surveys taken by students and faculty, discussion of the development of senior faculty and staff housing, Greek organizations, minority housing, and public hearing commentary on various housing issues.</p>
