        <p>In regards to the original order of the Francis A. Allen Papers, best care was taken on the part of the processor to respect that order in many cases. The Correspondence and Writings series are more or less in the original order that they were found in, although additional correspondence scattered throughout the rest of the collection was incorporated into the appropriate folders. The other materials in the collection were received in a somewhat disorganized state, and were organized according to subject if they did not fit within the Correspondence or Writings series.</p>
        <p>Documents that were separated from the collection include duplicates of any kind, correspondence that did not directly pertain to Francis Allen (see below), some book reviews (a selected sample remains), University of Michigan publications (since they are already in another collection of the Bentley Library), student examinations from other universities (a selected sample remains), financial documents, junk mail, brochures, and published works that were not for a professional journal, organization, or newspaper (examples include those written for textbooks or encyclopedias).</p>
        <p>At times, correspondence within the collection was written from individual to recipient, and Allen was carbon copied (or "cc'ed") in the message. In these cases, if Allen was not mentioned at all in the text of the letter, it was discarded. Although there are exceptions that remain in the collection, such as brochures that were sent to Allen for various seminars or documents that directly involved his interests. In these cases, an attachment letter was usually present along with the document, explaining why it would be of interest to him.</p>
        <p>Within the initial accession, which was donated by Francis Allen himself, he would at times include notes that were paper clipped to a corresponding document. These notes usually describe the context of why the document was created, and often include Allen's opinion or a short anecdote relating to it. These notes have been retained</p>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Francis Alfred Allen was born in Kansas City, Kansas, in 1919. After attending Cornell College in Iowa, he served in the United States Army Air Corps as a weatherman during World War II. After the war, he continued on to Northwestern University to finish his law degree in 1946. He married June Walsh in 1947, and had two children, Neil and Susan.</p>
      <p>Allen started his teaching career at Northwestern University in 1948. He subsequently went on to teach at Harvard (1953-1956) the University of Chicago (1956-1962 and 1963-1966), and the University of Michigan (1962-1963 and 1966-1986). He became dean of the Law School at the University of Michigan from 1966 to 1971.</p>
      <p>Allen also participated in court proceedings throughout his career. After returning from World War II, Allen served as clerk to Chief Justice Fred Vinson from 1946 to 1948. In the early 1950s, he also served as a lawyer for a short time in the Cook County criminal court in Illinois. From 1972 to 1979, he took part in Kaimowitz vs. Department of Mental Health for the State of Michigan, in which patients of a mental institution felt that they were forced against their will to participate in psychosurgical procedures because of their status in society.</p>
      <p>Allen concentrated most of his professional efforts towards reforming criminal law in the United States, as well as analyzing the concept of rehabilitation and how it has evolved over time. He also wrote and published many works on family law and juvenile law.</p>
      <p>Because of his role as a reformer in the field of criminal law, Allen was often called to public service. In 1961, Allen played a pivotal role in the creation of the Illinois Criminal Code. But his most important accomplishment was the chairmanship of the Attorney General's Commission on Poverty and the Administration of Federal Criminal Justice. The report of that committee directly led to the passing of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 and the Bail Reform Act of 1966.</p>
      <p>Allen was also the recipient of many awards during his lifetime. In 1975, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and became President of the Association of American Law Schools in 1976. Allen was a visiting expert for the Salzburg Seminar of American Studies, and a scholar in residence at the Rockefeller Foundation in Bellagio, Italy. He also was a visiting professor for Northwestern University, Boston College, and the University of Chicago.</p>
      <p>After retiring from the University of Michigan in 1986, Allen moved to Gainesville, Florida, were he taught at the University of Florida until his retirement in 1994. He passed away on April 6, 2007. He was survived by his wife June and son Neil.</p>

      <p>The Francis A. Allen Papers are composed of professional and personal documents spanning 1940-2006, with the majority of the documents dating between 1950-2000. The bulk of the papers (roughly 50 percent) are correspondence, including professional, academic, and personal documents. The next biggest sub-set is a sampling of some of his published works as well as unpublished works. There are also documents from court cases he was involved in, speeches he delivered over the course of his career, and samples of student examinations he gave while teaching as a law school professor.</p>

          <p>The Biographical series contains two folders. One contains a bibliography of Allen's published works from 1941 to 1998 as well as a résumé from 1997. The other folder contains two short biographies (an obituary from the <title render="italic">Chicago Tribune</title>, and one written upon Allen being named the Edson R.

          <p>The Correspondence series, 1.5 linear feet, is arranged in alphabetical order. The types of correspondence range from personal letters, letters of recommendation, opinions on law matters or academia, and personal or financial business letters. For subjects (either individuals or institutions) with a large amount of correspondence, their materials were separated out into individual folders. Examples of these subjects include Allen's brother William, his brother Clark, various departmental units at the University of Michigan (the Law School, University Press, etc.), his close friend and colleague Norval Morris, and personal correspondence. Allen indicates on the upper right hand of most correspondence pages the name of the individual that the document pertains to, but his schema of doing this is at times inconsistent. Although the majority of the papers are organized by last name, sometimes they will be organized by the organization he was writing to instead of the individual to whom the letter was actually addressed (examples being the <title render="italic">Harvard Law Review</title> or the University of Chicago Press). In these cases the <title render="italic">Harvard Law Review</title> correspondence would be placed in the "H" folder, and the University of Chicago correspondence in the "C" folder. When there was a large number of documents pertaining to one individual or unit, care was taken to place the documents in reverse chronological order (in most cases, this was the original order that Allen used).</p>
          <p>The personal correspondence folder includes information regarding the publishing of Allen's works from various university presses (fax receipts, contracts, etc.), any documents containing Allen's social security number, and letters and cards of a personal nature. Although documents of this kind are also in other correspondence folders, the respect of the original order has been maintained.</p>
          <p>Common correspondents include:
            <list type="simple"><item>Allen’s family: Clark Allen and William Allen.</item><item>Faculty colleagues at the University of Michigan: Lee C. Bollinger, Terrence Sandalow, Theodore St. Antoine, Thomas E. Sunderland, and Allan F. Smith.</item><item>Colleagues at other law schools or professional organizations: Paul D. Carrington, Albert W. Alschuler, Dick Julin, Sanford Kadish, James Marsh, Norval Morris, Helen Silving, and Frank Zimring.</item><item>Institutions:<title render="italic">Harvard Law Review</title>, departments within the University of Michigan (University Press, Administrative Affairs, Law School), Northwestern University, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Salzburg Seminar.</item><item>Others: Supreme Court Associate Justice Byron R. White, Walter O. Weyrauch, and Austin Wright.</item></list>

          <p>The Writings series contains a sampling of Allen's published works, dating from roughly 1950 to 2006, and comprises almost 0.5 linear feet. The majority of the works are book reviews, opinion articles, speeches and professional articles. Allen was published in many law review journals, newspapers, and magazines, and also wrote a few books. This series contains the Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Federal Criminal Justice, which was written in February 1963. Lastly, there is a folder of unpublished writings, which includes reactions to books, reports he was asked to write, and even poetry.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Psychosurgery Trial series is three folders containing a variety of court documents, including pre-trial statements, opinions, affidavits, hearing notices, briefs, and papers that were collected prior to the litigation process. The timeline for the entire case spans from 1972 to 1979, although many of the documents are dated between 1972 and 1974, with only a few documents from the later years. The documents are in approximate chronological order, with the papers from the same year being grouped together, although not necessarily in correct monthly order. The documents in this series cover two trials, Kaimowitz vs. Department of Mental Health for the State of Michigan, and People of the State of Michigan vs. Louis Maurice Smith. Gabe Kaimowitz, on behalf of the Medical Committee for Human Rights and the Medical Care Division of the Michigan Public Health Association, represented the mistreated patients of the Michigan State Hospital System. Louis Maurice Smith was one of those patients, although his name had been changed to John Doe on many of the court documents. Allen was Smith's attorney during part of the trial.</p>
          <p>In the later years of the People vs. Smith trial (1978-1979), it eventually reached the Michigan Supreme Court. Although these documents are fewer in number, they provide a concise timeline of the entire psychosurgery trial since 1972.</p>

          <p>The Speeches series is separated into folders according to year, which are in reverse chronological order. The dates of Allen's speeches range from 1952 to 1988. The types of speeches include addresses to various law schools, professional organizations, and political organizations, speeches where he gives his opinion on a legal subject, those given as Dean of the Law School at the University of Michigan, memorial services, presentations, and lectures. A great many of them are dedicated to the controversies of legal action during the Vietnam War.</p>

          <p>The Student Examinations series consists of two folders: one of exams given at the University of Michigan, and the other of exams given at all other schools where Allen taught, including Northwestern, Harvard, the University of Chicago, and the University of Florida. The dating for this series ranges from roughly 1950 to the 1990s. In some cases, Allen had written out by hand answers to some of the exams. If those answers were found to match one of the exams, the answer sheets were placed immediately after the exam.</p>
