    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>David Ward, one of Michigan's noted lumber barons, was born in Keene, New York, in 1822. He and his parents and nine brothers and sisters moved to Newport, Michigan, in 1836. Nathan Ward, David's father, was a farmer and surveyor, who taught David the art of surveying and surviving in the woods of Michigan. David's frequent trips with his father into the woods, however, caused him to suffer from bronchitis and while recuperating from a bout in 1840 he began to study medicine. Over the next ten years he taught school and took a variety of surveying jobs, and when financially able, studied medicine at Cleveland Medical College (1847-1848) and the University of Michigan (1850-1851). He received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University in the Spring of 1851.</p>
      <p>David Ward had two goals in life: to be a full-fledged medical doctor and a wealthy man. Once he had achieved his first goal, he set out to acquire wealth and he did so by putting his surveying talents to work. He surveyed the vast tracts of pine land in northern Michigan for large operators and charged as his fee, one-fourth of the lands he surveyed. Over the years, through surveying and purchasing, he acquired 800 million feet of pine in Michigan. In addition, he acquired extensive holdings of redwood lands in California, coal lands in West Virginia, and pine lands in Vancouver. By the time he died in 1900, at the age of seventy-eight, he had achieved his second goal. Newspapers estimated his estate to be worth $15 million.</p>
      <p>David and his wife, Elizabeth Perkins Ward, raised their three sons and one daughter on a two-hundred acre farm on Orchard Lake, which he purchased in 1862. They moved to Detroit in 1881 because of Mrs. Ward's rheumatism, but spent summers at the farm, and in 1893, Ward built a $30,000 house on the lake. In his later years, his son Willis, grandson Franklin B., and son-in-law George Root helped him run his business concerns. They were named executors of the David Ward Estate.</p>
      <p>Willis continued his involvement in Ward businesses after his father's death, and was particularly concerned with the sale and/or development of Ward properties. In addition, he devoted a good deal of time to the development of the Orchard Lake area. He contributed the land which facilitated the organization of the Orchard Lake Country Club, purchased Apple Island on Orchard Lake for conservation purposes, and was active in the good roads movement. He was an author, who wrote extensively on the history of Orchard Lake, an inventor, and was interested in poultry, cattle, and fruit farming. He and his wife Mabel had two children: Marjorie, who married Frederick S. Strong, Jr., a career Army officer and an early founder of the city of Orchard Lake; and Harold, who married Virginia Palmer of Detroit.</p>
      <p>Harold carried on his father's business concerns after Willis died in 1944. He also served on the board of directors of Kingswood School Cranbrook in Bloomfield Hills, and like his father, was actively involved in the Orchard Lake Country Club and in the development of Orchard Lake. Harold died in 1983.</p>

      <p>The majority of the Ward Family collection is comprised of materials generated by Willis Ward and his son, Harold, and thus reflect the life of the family in the twentieth century. The strengths of the collection rest on materials which document upper-class family life in the first three decades of this century; the development of the Orchard Lake area in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s; the extensive Michigan land holdings of the Ward family; and the history of the lumber town of Deward, Michigan. The researcher should be aware that there are only limited materials in the collection which document either David Ward's business pursuits in Michigan or his personal life. The researcher should supplement those materials with use of Ward's published autobiography.</p>
      <p>There are six series which comprise the Ward collection: Personal; Correspondence; Land Holdings; Photographs; Architectural Drawings; and Maps. Whenever possible the original order of materials in the first three series has been maintained.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Individuals subseries is arranged by family members. The folders contain material which will help the researcher better understand the personalities of Ward family members, particularly David, his sons, Charley and Willis, and his grandson, Harold. It is also the portion of the collection which best documents David Ward's estate. There are two linear feet of legal documents, maps, and bound and unbound correspondence pertaining to the execution of the estate. The bound volumes of correspondence, which are in very fragile condition, are comprised of the letters of the family law firm involved in work with the estate.</p>
            <p>By studying the estate files, the researcher will learn of the extent of Ward property holdings at the time of David's death. (David Ward materials were received in two accessions. The second group of estate files more thoroughly documents land holdings in West Virginia.) In addition, along with the use of Willis Ward's business correspondence, insight can be gained into the establishment and running of the town of Deward. Deward was located just north of Grayling and was built as part of David Ward's estate to cut the pine on 70,000 acres of timber in Crawford, Kalkaska, and Otsego Counties. Per instructions from Ward in his will, the logging was completed in 1912, after which Deward became a ghost town. The insight gained from these files primarily concerns the business affairs connected with the Deward logging operations.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series (fifteen linear feet) is also arranged by family members. The original order in which the correspondence was kept has been maintained. There are, therefore, files arranged chronologically and files arranged by correspondent. Under Willis Ward, for example, the researcher will find incoming correspondence arranged by family member, including parents, wife, and children, that is of a distinctly personal nature. There are also extensive correspondence files arranged chronologically, which relate to his business concerns. This dual arrangement also holds true for Harold Ward. Contents list entries describe, for each family member, how his or her correspondence is arranged.</p>
          <p>The Correspondence series is the most informative series on Ward Family life. There are letters from Charles Ward, the somewhat wayward son of David, to his parents throughout the 1890s. They describe his life in New York State as a florist and detail his attempts to return to his parents' good graces. When studied in conjunction with the David Ward estate files, the researcher will better understand the animosity between Charles and the other Ward heirs. The largest portion of this series is comprised of Willis and Harold Ward's correspondence. The letters to and from family members are interesting because they document, in some detail, the everyday life of a wealthy, close-knit family. Children describe their school life, summers on the lake, travels to Europe, and interactions with friends and other family members. Parents give advice to their children and frequently comment to one another on their children's activities. They describe their own travels, both in the United States and abroad, and discuss national and world events. The business correspondence of Willis, which is quite extensive, and Harold, primarily concerns family land holdings.</p>

          <p>Land Holdings (six linear feet), the third series in the collection, is comprised of correspondence and legal documents which pertain to Ward property in California, Michigan, West Virginia, and Vancouver (Alice Lake). The series is arranged into five subseries: a general subseries, and one for each geographical location. The researcher is advised to examine the general subseries prior to studying materials which relate to a particular location. It is comprised of documents, primarily correspondence of Willis and Harold, that were kept together and concern one or more of the major land holdings of the family.</p>
          <p>In the California, West Virginia, and Vancouver subseries, there are files which provide background and summary-type information on Ward holdings. For California, there are additional files of materials from companies set up by the family to sell its redwood holdings. The Michigan subseries is further divided into three sections: Northern Michigan, Orchard Lake, and West Bloomfield. The Northern Michigan files can be used to trace the disposition of Ward land holdings in the 1920s. The Orchard Lake and West Bloomfield sections are interesting for the researcher studying the land development of these two areas in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. The materials from companies set up by the Wards to oversee the sale of their properties, in addition to the business correspondence of Willis and Harold (see Correspondence series) are particularly helpful in this regard.</p>
