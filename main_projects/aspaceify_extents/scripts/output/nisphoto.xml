      <p>News and Information Services (NIS) is the media relations office of the University of Michigan. NIS disseminates (to internal and external audiences) information about university programs, research, and activities of faculty and staff, primarily through the news media. NIS also responds to media requests for information about the university. Staff is comprised of information officers and editors covering specific university units, a photography unit, and a radio and television unit. This office also publishes <title render="italic">The University Record</title>, a weekly newspaper for faculty and staff, and <title render="italic">Michigan Today</title>, a quarterly tabloid newspaper sent to U-M alumni (complete sets of these publications are held by the Bentley Library). Some units on campus handle media relations through offices largely independent of NIS. These units include sports information, the Medical Center, the College of Engineering, Law School, and Business School.</p>
      <p>News and Information Services has undergone several name and organizational changes, but can trace its roots to 1897, when the Regents requested a plan for to disseminate University news to the State. This original department of information services was primarily responsible for publishing newsletters and frequently struggled to finance its operations. By 1930, the need for a news agency had grown, and following the installation of President Alexander G. Ruthven, the university created a News Dissemination Service (often called the University of Michigan News Service). Led by Wilfred B. Shaw, the Service had two primary functions. First, it was responsible for preparing weekly releases for nearly 800 newspapers throughout the state and beyond. This reporting included news about the Regents, research conducted by professors, affairs of the student body, and all other campus news with the exclusion of athletics. The second function was to send news about individual students to their home town papers. (<title render="italic">Michigan Alumnus</title> May 27, 1959).</p>
      <p>Originally part of the Bureau of Alumni Relations, in 1942 the University News Service, now led by Donald K. Anderson, became an independent department. In 1946, Arthur L. Brandon was appointed as the Director of Information Services and took over responsibility for the public information services on behalf of the University, services which included the University News Service, news photography, and promotional publications. In 1948, services expanded with the acquisition of the WUOM radio station and continued to adapt to new media with the addition of television.</p>
      <p>With the administrative changes resulting from the installment of President Harlan H. Hatcher, Brandon's title was changed to Director of University Relations and the University News Service became part of the Office of University Relations. Other changes followed, with Regents meetings being opened to the press in 1954 and University News Service taking on photographic coverage at athletic events in 1956. In 1957, Brandon resigned from his position and was replaced by Lyle M. Nelson. As Director of University Relations, Nelson combined radio and television under the director of broadcasting. Nelson retired in 1961 and was replaced by Michael Radock. One year later, administrative reorganization created an Information Service.</p>
      <p>The Information Service consisted of three divisions, including News Service, News Photography, and Community Relations. Further reorganization in 1963 and 1964 moved the publications and editorial services under the umbrella of Information Services and saw the promotion of Cleland B. Wyllie, who had been with the News Service since the 1940s, to Director of Media Relations.</p>
      <p>While the Office of University Relations underwent several changes and reorganizations in the following years, Information Services remained under its jurisdiction until 1998, when the office was divided into three vice presidential posts. One of these new posts was the Vice President for Media Relations, which was responsible for the University's News Service. In 2000, the Media Relations became the Office of the Vice President for Communications, which is where the current News Service resides in the University organization. News Service has continued to expand its media types and now includes podcasts, social media, and other online resources in addition to its print, radio, and television services.</p>
      <p>Current information about News and Information Services and on-line versions of the <title render="italic">University Record</title> and <title render="italic">Michigan Today</title> (with searchable back issues of the <title render="italic">Record</title> from September 1992, and <title render="italic">Michigan Today</title> from December 1993) is available on the Web at the following URL: <emph render="italic">http://ns.umich.edu/new/</emph>.</p>

      <p>The News and Information Services Photographs document many aspects of university and community life, particularly activities of the administration, faculty, departments, and students beginning in 1946 and continuing into the early 1980s. Photographs were, for the most part, made by the staff of the News Service (later Information Services and now News and Information Services) for use with university press releases, or upon request of individuals with the university, or for outside media with special interests in university personnel or activities.</p>
      <p>The record group presently consists of 10 series (A-J).</p>
      <p>The series are comprised primarily of black and white negatives and contact sheets, although Series E includes six linear feet and one oversize box of prints, most of which are 8" x 10" black and white images, and Series H includes color transparencies. There are also prints in Series I, Series J, slides in Series E and I, and a 16 mm film in Series I. Color negatives become more frequent in the late 1980s.</p>
      <p>The original order and file headings created by News and Information Services have been retained wherever possible. Thus, the several lettered series reflect various organizational schemes used in the past.</p>

          <p>Series A (12 linear ft.; ca. 1946-1956) consists of black and white 4" x 5" negatives and 2-1/4" x 2-1/4" negatives with occasional contact prints, produced from about 1946 to 1956. The negatives cover a broad range of university topics.</p>
          <p>This series is arranged into broad subjects with a chronological order within the subject headings. Building names have frequently been used for organizing the material rather than departmental names. Often included under the name of buildings are activities, departments, equipment, laboratories, machinery, offices, services, and individuals. For example, Bureau of Appointments may be found under Administration Building - Interior. Building names are those that were current when the photographs were made.</p>
          <p>There is a subject index (created by News and Information Services) to Series A in the inventory section of this finding aid.</p>

          <p>This series, commonly known as "Series D" is part of the News and Information Services photographs collection, which consists of several other series often based on format such as the size of the negatives (4x5 or 35mm) or content (general campus photography or aerial photographs). Series D consists of black and white 4x5 inch negatives and 1-1/4 x 2-1/4 inch prints and negatives of faculty and staff (and some student) portraits alphabetically arranged.</p>
          <p>A comprehensive index for the entire series was created in 2007. It replaces what had been a partial index covering less than half of the content (two additions were received after the initial index was prepared). Based on information supplied on the original envelopes, the listing includes faculty/staff name, department or unit (when provided) and date(s) of the portrait. Bentley Library negative numbers are included (if applicable).

          <p>SERIES E (6 linear ft. plus one oversize box; ca. 1950s-1990s) consists of Photographic prints of a variety of campus subjects, (mainly black and white) some of which were received by News and Information Services from non-university photographers. Box 17 contains color slides.</p>
          <p>Images include documentation of a wide range of activities and special events (such as athletics, commencement, demonstrations in the 1960s), views of buildings and facilities, and photographs of people in both formal and informal settings. Also included in the series are color slides of the University Orchestra trip to Russia, football games in 1971, and various campus scenes.</p>
          <p>Photographs with numbers on the back produced before August, 1974 usually have corresponding negatives located in Series B or Series C. An index to Series E is included in the inventory section of this finding aid. Subject headings, for the most part, were maintained as devised by News and Information Services.</p>
          <p>A significant addition to the original Series E consists primarily of negatives taken of the School of Business Administration for Pringle Smith, editor of the Business School's <title render="italic">Dividend</title> magazine. These negatives retain their original filing scheme and are organized alphabetically by subject. A date is also included because it appears that while the files were organized alphabetically they were also separated by the years in which they were produced. Included in this series are two linear feet of general negatives. They cover a range of subjects, with large sections pertaining to the construction of the Taubman Medical Center, Law Library and the Law School in the early 1980s. These negatives are organized alphabetically based on their subject heading. There is also a box of slides included in this series. These slides cover a wide range of campus activities, many deal with science and engineering trips or experiments, and a small number document John F. Kennedy's famous Peace Corps speech on the steps of the Union in 1960. There are small sub-series relating to the solar car within the print series and the slide series. The slides are housed in plastic sheets and are organized alphabetically by subject.</p>

          <p>SERIES G (2.5 linear ft.; 1949-1970)consists of aerial survey photographs; Mainly 7" x 7" negatives and contact prints of an aerial survey of the Ann Arbor area from 1965 to 1967. Material in Boxes G-2 and G-3 was accessioned in 1997 and consists of 5" x 7" negatives (including some color negatives) and some contact prints of aerial views from 1949 to 1970. Negatives are arranged by the numbering system used by News and Information Services. Images are primarily of the University of Michigan but also include aerial views of businesses in and around Ann Arbor, as well as views of, and businesses in surrounding communities. Some non-aerial views are included such as a series of negatives of Ann Arbor churches dating from approximately 1959.</p>
          <p>A brief index to Series G is included in the inventory section of this finding aid. Subject access, however, is best achieved by reviewing descriptions on envelopes housing the material, and for part, by using the index cards located in the reading room.</p>
