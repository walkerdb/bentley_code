    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Harlan Henthorne Hatcher was best known in his roles as author, educator, and university administrator. He published over seventeen books, numerous short stories, and many essays. At Ohio State University he served as an English Instructor, Assistant Professor of English, Professor of English, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and Vice-President. Hatcher served as President of the University of Michigan from 1951 to 1967.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hatcher was born on September 9, 1898 to Robert E. Hatcher and Malinda B. (Leslie) Hatcher of Ironton, Ohio. He attended Ohio State University from 1919-1927, receiving his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in American Literature. In 1925 he completed post-doctoral work at the University of Chicago. Later, Dr. Hatcher spent a year in Italy, France, and England studying the Renaissance.</p>
      <p>Harlan Hatcher spent much of his career at Ohio State University. He was an English instructor from 1922-1928, Assistant Professor of English from 1928 to 1932, Professor of English from 1932-1944, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences from 1944 to 1948, and Vice-President of Ohio State University from 1948 to 1951.</p>
      <p>In addition, Dr. Hatcher had an active professional life outside of the university. He wrote over seventeen books about the people, the history, and the geology of Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky in addition to the subject of English Literature. Several of his short stories and essays were published in journals. In 1937 and 1938 Dr. Hatcher directed the Ohio branch of the Federal Writers Project, and he was the editor of their final product, The Ohio Guide. From 1938 to 1944 he wrote a weekly book critic column in the Columbus Citizen. He was the Editorial Advisor for College English from 1938 to1948, and was guest editor for several other publications. Dr. Hatcher was also involved in the military. He was a U.S. Army Private in 1918 and a Naval Reserve Lieutenant from 1942 to 1944. He served as a V-5 Instructor at the Pre-Flight School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1944.</p>
      <p>In 1951 Harlan Hatcher became president of the University of Michigan, a position he held until 1967. Under his leadership, enrollment more than doubled and the budget nearly quadrupled. He oversaw the development of North Campus and the regional campuses in Flint and Dearborn. He revolutionized the university's library system with the establishment of the Undergraduate Library, which was open long hours and had open-shelf access to books.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hatcher was an active participator in organizations. His Faculty Personnel Record for the University of Michigan names membership or involvement in over eighty-five organizations through the 1960s. He dedicated his retirement to the problems of pollution and urbanization of the Great Lakes. He was president of the Developing Great Lakes Megalopolis Research Project (DGLMRP), he was on the board of directors for the Center for the Great Lakes (CFGL), and he was a trustee of the Great Lakes Foundation.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hatcher's first wife, Frank (Dot) Wilson Colfax, predeceased him. He married Anne Gregory Vance in 1942. They had two children, Robert Leslie and Anne Linda. Harlan Hatcher died in 1998, at the age of ninety-nine.</p>

      <p>The Harlan Henthorne Hatcher Papers document his University of Michigan presidency, Ohio State University career, literary career, organizational involvement, personal life, and family history. The collection spans the years 1837-1998, with the bulk of the materials covering 1891-1986. It includes correspondence, newspaper clippings, manuscripts, speeches, yearly datebooks, oral history interview transcripts, magnetic audio tape recordings, an audiocassette recording, and photographs. The collection is strongest in its documentation of Dr. Hatcher's presidency at the University of Michigan, especially in correspondence and speeches. Documentation is weakest on the subjects of his Ohio State University career before 1944 and organizational involvement before 1967. The collection may be useful to researchers interested in the history of the University of Michigan from 1951-1967, the duties of university administrators and their spouses, authors of the 1920's to 1950's, and environmental activism in Michigan in the 1970's and 1980's.</p>
      <p>The Harlan Hatcher collection has been divided into two subgroups of files: those which were created or accumulated from his tenure as president of the University of Michigan (1951-1967) and those materials (mainly personal) dated either prior to or subsequent to Hatcher's presidential years.</p>
      <p>The library, as archives of the University of Michigan, is the repository for all of the files of its presidents. For historic reasons, all of the papers of presidents up to and including Harlan Hatcher have been treated as personal collections and cataloged under the name of the president. Beginning with Hatcher's successor - Robben Fleming - and continuing to the present, the files of individuals occupying the president's office have been considered both personal and institutional. Records created from an individual's responsibility as president, usually materials from the years when he was president, are treated as office files and have been cataloged as part of the University of Michigan President's Office record group. Materials from either before or after an individual's tenure as president have been treated separately and have been cataloged under that president's name.</p>

          <p>Hatcher is the last president whose collection contains a mixture of both personal and office files. The University of Michigan Presidency subgroup is the largest portion of the collection comprising 59 linear feet of correspondence, memoranda, reports, speeches, and other materials on which he acted or which crossed his desk as president. The University of Michigan Presidency subgroup is divided into four series: Yearly Correspondence Files, Organizational Responsibilities/Special Events and Issues as President, Ceremonial/Public Role as President, and Topical Files.</p>

            <p>The Yearly Correspondence File (47 linear ft.; 1951-1967) series is the largest series in the collection and is further divided into chronological subseries for each academic year. Each year is comprised of a single alphabetical sequence of papers on which Hatcher acted or transferred to another university administrator for action. Included as well are the communications which faculty, departments and other units, alumni, legislators, citizens, and other individuals had with the president.</p>

            <p>The Organizational Responsibilities/Special Activities as President series (6.3 linear ft.; 1953-1967) is the title given to those categories of files, kept separate by the president's office from the Yearly Correspondence Files and covering an extended period of time. These files cover Hatcher's participation as representative of the University of Michigan with different academic and professional organizations. These include the Michigan Council of State College Presidents, the Midwestern University Research Association, the Commission on the Education of Women of the American Council on Education, the Institute for Defense Analyses, the Citizens Committee on Higher Education, the Council for Financial Aid to Education, the Joint Office of Institutional Research, and the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. In addition, this series includes files relating to the celebration of the university's sesquicentennial, both ceremonial observances and lectures and fund-raising opportunities. Lastly, within this series are those letters and other working materials accumulated in response to the changing of the name of Michigan State College to Michigan State University in 1955.</p>

            <p>The final series in the President's Files subgroup is Topical Files (1 linear ft.; 1951-1967). This series contains a miscellanea of files on particular topics. These materials were accessioned after the initial receipt of Hatcher's Yearly Correspondence Files and were undoubtedly kept separate for personal reasons. Some of these files might have been maintained in Hatcher's residence and not his office. The topics are self-explanatory.</p>

              <p>The Family subseries contains poetry, correspondence, and genealogical materials by and about various members of the Hatcher family and close friends. Of particular note are the files on Anne Gregory Vance Hatcher, Harlan's wife. She was involved in arranging and hosting many social functions at the University of Michigan during her husband's presidency. Also of note are the love letters between Harlan's parents, Robert E. Hatcher and Malinda B. Leslie, in 1891 and 1892. They began corresponding after Robert visited Malinda's parents' home in Coal Run, Pike County, Kentucky. Because Robert lived in Coal Grove, Lawrence County, Ohio, much of their relationship until their marriage is documented in these letters. A related run of correspondence are the letters to Harlan from his wife, Anne Gregory, in January and February of 1943 while Harlan was serving as a V-5 instructor in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Also of note are the letters between Harlan and his mother from 1919 to 1948.</p>
