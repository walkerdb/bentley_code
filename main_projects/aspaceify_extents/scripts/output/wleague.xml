      <p>From the time that women were admitted to the University of Michigan in 1870 (some four decades after the university's founding) until 1896, when the first dean of women was appointed, there was no organized supervision of women students on campus. The university provided no housing for students; female students, like their male counterparts, were left to find their own lodgings in town, usually in mixed rooming houses. Few of these rooming houses had sitting rooms for receiving callers.</p>
      <p>Given the small number of women students on campus in proportion to the men, and lacking dormitories or places on campus where they might meet, women students at times felt isolated. As one early student related: "Of social life we had none, and in sheer despair of ever becoming acquainted with one another we founded a society mildly literary and aggressively friendly." The Women's League, of which this student spoke, was organized in 1890 by women students and wives of faculty members.</p>
      <p>The Women's League had both social and governing functions. The league sponsored meetings, dances, and lectures; welcomed new students and helped them find housing; and, after the turn of the century, regulated rooming houses. Events such as the Freshman Spread, the Women's Banquet, and the Junior Girls' Play, an annual musical comedy first produced in 1904, were also held under the aegis of the Women's League. Through the efforts of league members, separate rooming houses for women, known as League Houses, were established in the early twentieth century. The league also played a prominent role in the movement for dormitories on campus.</p>
      <p>The league was governed by a student executive committee and an advisory committee made up of women known as associate members. The advisory and executive committees held regular business meetings together and separately as necessary. Beginning with the academic year 1919-20, all women students were assessed an annual fee of one dollar, which went to the Women's League, and all women students automatically became members of the Women's League upon admission to the university.</p>
      <p>In June 1891 the Detroit branch of the Collegiate Alumnae initiated a campaign to raise funds for a women's building on the University of Michigan campus adjacent to the new men's gymnasium then under construction. Over the next several years the league raised funds for this proposed women's building, which opened in 1896 as an annex to Waterman Gymnasium. The women's gymnasium, named for the principal donor, Regent Levi Barbour, was opened the following year, and in 1900 parlors were completed. Housing the offices of the dean of women, Barbour Gymnasium became the focus of women's social activities on campus for the next three decades, until the ever-increasing number of women students outgrew the building.</p>
      <p>In 1921, shortly after the completion of the Michigan Union building, a million-dollar campaign was launched by the Alumnae Council of the Alumni Association to raise funds for a women's building on campus. The Regents agreed to provide the land if the alumnae could raise $500,000 or more to construct and endow the building. The state legislature appropriated $350,000 in 1927 for the purchase of a site. The building was designed by the firm of Irving K. Pond and Allen Pond, the same architecture firm that designed the Michigan Union. The Michigan League building opened on May 4, 1929, although formal dedication ceremonies were not held until June 14, 1929 in the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater.</p>
      <p>The Michigan League building was initially governed by the Alumnae Council, in cooperation with the Board of Regents. Due to difficulties in meeting operating expenses, the Alumnae Council gave the building to the university in 1930 and a governing board composed of alumnae, faculty, and students was created. Beginning in 1933, a portion of the fees paid by women students was allocated to the maintenance of the building; thereafter all women students were members of the Michigan League.</p>
      <p>To eliminate confusion between the Women's League as an organization and the Michigan League building, the administration of the building and the student organization were combined under the title Michigan League in 1934-35; the Women's League became the Undergraduate Division. Under this organization, students were given a greater share in the responsibilities of the board of governors, with the league president serving as chairman. A board of representatives composed of the Assembly and Panhellenic Association drafted regulations and decided questions of student government, while the Judiciary Council, elected by the women's student body, enforced these rules. In 1950 the Undergraduate Division once again assumed its original title, the Women's League, while the Michigan League persisted as the name of the building.</p>
      <p>In the course of the 1960s the governance and activities of men and women students were gradually united and the need for a separate women's governing body diminished. The Women's League was gradually subsumed under general student governance. Women were admitted to the Student Government Council and in 1961 the offices of the dean of men and the dean of women were replaced by the Office of Student Affairs. In June 1963 the Board of Regents approved the creation of the Student Activities Center, which merged the student activities of the Michigan League and the Michigan Union. The league and union buildings continued to operate under distinct management.</p>

      <p>The records of the Women's League date from 1890 to 1965 and measure 33 linear feet. The records are divided into eight series: Women's League (records of the organization), Michigan League (records of the building), Administrative, Students, Union-League Merger, Photographs, and Scrapbooks and Architectural records. The records span the life of the organization and are especially strong for the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however many of the subseries include records for only a year or two. The bulk of the records are President's Reports, which consist of two to five large bound volumes for each academic year. The subseries in the last five series are arranged alphabetically by type of material, and many are continuations of subseries from the first two series which were from an earlier accession.</p>

          <p>The Women's League records are arranged in alphabetical order by type of material, with the exception of Histories, which have been placed at the beginning of the first box. The largest portion of this series consists of President's Reports dating from 1918/19 to 1962/63 (bulk 1933/34-1962/63). In addition to the reports by the presidents of the Women's League, these massive volumes contain minutes, reports, and financial records of the various governing bodies such as the Women's Senate, the Judiciary Council, and Panhellenic and Assembly Associations and of such activities as Senior Night, the Junior Girls' Play, Soph Show, and Frosh Weekend. In addition, the volumes contain programs, newsletters, and other material documenting the league's activities.</p>
          <p>Also included in the Women's League series are minutes of the league and its board of directors, legal documents, financial records documenting fundraising for the Women's Building (Barbour Gymnasium) and women's athletic fields, programs and publicity relating to the Junior Girls' Play and other social activities, scrapbooks, and a small number of photographs. The photographs consist primarily of portraits and group shots of officers and members of the Women's League and Mortarboard. Also included are photographs of Field Day, 1912; the fancy dress party in 1914; and the cast of the 1914 production of "Jeanne d'arc." Of special note is the correspondence, which dates from the earliest years of the organization's existence and includes autobiographical sketches written by alumnae in 1896 and letters by such prominent literary figures as Ella Wheeler Wilcox and W.D. Howells expressing their views on athletic education for women. (The latter were written in response to an appeal for support of the league's campaign for a women's gymnasium and were published in the April 1896 issue of <title render="italic">The Invader.</title>)</p>

          <p>The Michigan League series is also arranged alphabetically by type of material, with histories placed at the beginning. The material in this series relates primarily to the fundraising campaign for the Michigan League building and to the operations of the building. Included are correspondence, minutes of the board of governors and executive committee, operating statements, legal and financial records of the building campaign, scrapbooks of the League Library, and a memoir written by Edith Wheeler, who served as manager of the Michigan League from 1947 to 1956. The correspondence relates for the most part to the search for a business manager for the league in the year prior to its opening; the large number of highly qualified female applicants from across the country indicates the widespread interest in the idea of a women's center in a university setting.</p>

          <p>The Administrative series documents the governance and functioning of the Michigan League. The Board of Governors subseries comprises a significant minority of the Administrative records and may be seen as an extension of the earlier Michigan League's Board of Governors subseries (Box 31).</p>
          <p>The Building subseries differs from the earlier Building Operations subseries (Box 31) in its documentation of a later period (primarily the 1960s) and in its focus on students' access to the facilities. In the Financial subseries, the Operating Statements and League Undergraduate Fund complement pre-existing series (Box 32 and Box 1 respectively).</p>

          <p>The Union-League Merger series expands on folders scattered in the earlier series. The General file joins with the Women's League Correspondence, 1963-1964 (Box 1) to document the merger's planning stages and expected relationship to established organizations. The Newspaper Clippings file adds to its counterpart in the Michigan League's subseries (Box 2). The University Activities Center (UAC) merged the student activities of the Michigan League and Michigan Union. Included in this subseries are the minutes of the Joint Council Committee, which was established in March 1965 to select officers and determine policies and procedures for the UAC. The series also documents UAC's changing structure and activities.</p>
