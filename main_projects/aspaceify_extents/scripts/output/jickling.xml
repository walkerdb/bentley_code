    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>John Ward Jickling (1921-2012) grew up in Birmingham, Michigan and graduated from the University of Michigan College of Architecture in 1948. Jickling enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force in 1942 and was called up for service in 1943. He served at bases in Mississippi and Texas where he instructed gunnery students and acted as the architectural assistant to the Post Engineer at Harlingen Army Airfield.</p>
      <p>Jickling married Barbara Wright Fairman (who also graduated from the University of Michigan College of Architecture) in 1947 and they moved to Birmingham, MI where Jickling worked for Swanson Associates. John left Swanson and he and Barbara founded their own architectural firm, Jickling, Lyman &amp; Powell Associates of Troy, Michigan in 1962. Jickling was a prolific architect and designed several buildings for the University of Michigan, including the Gerald Ford Presidential Library, the Bentley Historical Library, and the Medical Research Building. In 1979 he was made a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. In 1983 he was awarded the Gold Medal by its Detroit Chapter and in 1988 he was given a Gold medal by the Michigan Society of Architects. He served as the Regional Director of the American Institute of Architects, the President of the Michigan Society of Architects, and the President of the Detroit Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Jickling retired from active practice in 1988 but continued to practice as a consultant until the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>Besides his involvement with the architecture community, Jickling was a founding member of the Oakland Land Conservancy and served as a board member of the Oakland County parks Foundation from 1989-1992. He also served on the Birmingham Planning Board, the Historic District Design Review Committee, and the Historic District Study Committee.</p>
      <p>Jickling's father and father-in-law were active members of their community as well. Clare Mason Jickling (1894-1968) attended Kalamazoo College and the University of Michigan. During World War I he served in the Army Air Corps. He and his wife, Norma Carland, lived in the Detroit area and in 1931 Clare established his own advertising firm, Wolf-Jickling-Dow.</p>
      <p>James Fairman (1896-1967) grew up in Big Rapids, MI. In 1918 he graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelors of Science in Engineering. He was a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army at Camp Meade, Maryland. Between 1919 and 1925 Fairman taught in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan. In 1921 he earned his Masters of Science in Engineering from the University of Michigan. Fairman worked for 37 years at the Consolidated Edison Company of New York until he retired in 1963. During his time there, he earned the nickname "Mr. Atom" for his work on an atomic powered generating plant on the Hudson River. In 1959 the American Society of Electrical Engineers awarded Fairman the Edison Gold Medal for his "outstanding performance in improving the design of large electric power systems; for far-sighted leadership in atomic power development; and for unremitting efforts to improve the engineering profession."</p>

          <p>The Professional series contains information on Jickling's architectural projects and architectural associations/firms of which he was a member. There is information on the firm he founded, Jickling, Lyman &amp; Powell, including meeting minutes, brochures, corporate resolutions, and stockholder's agreements. The assorted projects folder includes: drawings for Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois; a news release for Birmingham's first exposed steel parking structure, which involved Jickling's firm; and a directory of The Mall at Short Hills, New Jersey, with markings possibly made by Jickling. There is also about half a linear foot and two outsize folders of Jickling's architectural projects. These include drawings, blueprints, and correspondence concerning the structures. The unidentified folder contains drawings with no label. Jickling's involvement with Christ Church Cranbrook is professional and personal in nature. Large architectural drawings are included within the outsize folder. However, his other works-both professional and personal-are in their own category, "Christ Church Cranbrook."</p>
          <p>Besides architectural work, the Professional series includes information on Jickling's community involvement. Approximately half a linear foot contains reports and publications of the City of Birmingham, of which Jickling was a member of various boards. There are also records of the Michigan Architectural Foundation, including minutes, bylaws, and financial statements. The bulk of the series contains information on the Oakland Land Conservancy, including correspondence, easement information, newsletters, and maps. For both the Michigan Architectural Foundation and the Oakland Land Conservancy, the "founding documents" folder contains documents such as mission and vision statements of the organization.</p>

          <p>The Personal series contains Jickling's personal correspondence, James Fairman's papers, Clare Jickling's papers, genealogy information, and photographs. The "assorted" folder in the correspondence section contains letters from various friends, family members, and unidentified individuals. The correspondence section also includes Barbara Jickling's letters to people besides Jickling. The "undated" folder contains correspondence between Barbara and John Jickling. Jickling's letters home during his time in the military are also included in this section.</p>
          <p>The James Fairman section contains biographical articles that were published in newspapers and engineering newsletters. There are also folders of correspondence between Fairman and his wife, Bertha, and Barbara Jickling, his daughter. The miscellaneous folder contains a portrait photograph, editorial, a newsletter, stock certificate of the Fairman Electric Light and Power Co. (1897), and Fairman's funeral pamphlet. It also contains a deposit ticket from the 1890s of Fairman and Newton, Bankers and an 1880s stock certificate of the Big Rapids Woodenware Company.</p>
          <p>The Clare Jickling section contains Clare's personal correspondence, his will, and information on his military service during World War I. There are also records of Ralph L. Wolfe and Associates, where Clare served on the first board of directors. These records include bylaws and meeting minutes. Clare's section also includes three diaries of Norma Jickling (Carland), his wife. There are numerous philatelist brochures ranging from the 1890s to the 1930s that were published in various locations. Michigan philatelist brochures include the Michigan Philatelist (1909-1910) and The Michigan Stamp (1895). Some of the advertising brochures, entitled "Money," were written by C. M. Jickling.</p>
          <p>The series also contains a section of genealogy research that John Jickling conducted. Jickling was an avid genealogist and published multiple volumes about his family from Comstock, Michigan and from Norfolk, England. There are also a few folders dedicated to the Fairman family. The "Jickling research" folders contain notes and correspondence between John Jickling and David Jickling about their research. There are several family trees, one of which is about six feet long and stored in a tube. The Y2K Family Yearbook contains an accompanying CD-ROM. This section also contains the "Jickling Journal," which is a family newsletter written by John Jickling.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series includes photographs ranging from the mid-19th century to the early 2000s. Many of them are of the Jickling family. There are two scrapbooks in the series. One dates from the early 1900s and the other includes photographs from the late 19th-early 20th century. Finally, the series contains negatives from a family event.</p>
