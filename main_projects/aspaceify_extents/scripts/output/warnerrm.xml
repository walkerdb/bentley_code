    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Archivist, historian and professor, Robert Mark Warner was born on June 28, 1927, in Montrose, Colorado, son of Mark Thomas and Bertha Margaret (Rich) Warner. Warner completed his undergraduate work in history at Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio in 1949. It was here he met Eleanor Jane Bullock, whom he married in 1954. After a year as a high school teacher of history and speech in Montrose, he was drafted into the U.S. Army where he served in Germany, from 1950 to 1952, during the Korean War. Upon his return, Warner continued his education at the University of Michigan where he earned an M.A. (1953) and a Ph.D. (1958) in history. Warner's studies concentrated on "recent" history (then defined as 1876 to the 1950s). After completing his doctoral degree, Warner joined the faculty of the history department of the University of Michigan where he taught Michigan history. In 1974, he was invited by Dean Russell Bidlack to join the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Library Science and inaugurate the archival studies program.</p>
      <p>Warner's association with archives began during his early years as a graduate student, when he used the University of Michigan's Michigan Historical Collections (MHC) to do research. When a position as a research assistant in the Collections became available, Warner took his first step down a completely different road than he had imagined his career would take. During his years at the MHC, he was active in several professional archival organizations, including the International Council on Archives (ICA) and the Society of American Archivists (SAA). Warner was particularly active in SAA, where he served on the Council, as secretary, director, vice president and president, as well as many committees. By 1966, Warner had become director of the MHC (now known as the Bentley Historical Library), a position that he held until his appointment as Archivist of the United States in 1980.</p>
      <p>When Warner arrived at the National Archives and Records Services (NARS) in July of 1980, the organization had been without leadership for nearly a year, since the resignation of his predecessor James B. (Bert) Rhoads in 1979. Warner described the atmosphere that greeted him as one of demoralization and high tension. Friction had developed between NARS and its parent organization, the General Services Administration (GSA), over perceived interference and inappropriate intervention of GSA in archival matters. GSA Administrator Admiral Roland G. Freeman's plan to relocate federal records to regional Federal Records Centers around the country caused uproar in NARS and among scholars and archival and historical organizations around the country. NARS also faced an investigation by Congress and the Executive Branch over preservation activities and suffered from management problems.</p>
      <p>Warner's major accomplishment as Archivist of the U.S. was to secure the independence of the National Archives from GSA. While President Franklin D. Roosevelt had originally created the National Archives as an independent agency in 1934, by the 1950s it had become a subdivision of the GSA. As early as 1968, a movement to free NARS from the GSA had been launched, but quickly foundered. Bills were introduced in the Senate in 1980 and 1981, but failed to come to a vote. In 1982, the Smithsonian Study came out, recommending autonomy, but was rejected by GSA Administrator Gerald Carmen. By 1983 it had become clear to Warner that NARS could no longer remain a captive of GSA if it was to be an effective organization. With the support of Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon and several other key figures in Washington, the National Archives and Administration Act of 1983 was introduced in the Senate on March 23, 1983 (S. 905). In September, the bill was introduced in the House as H.R. 3987. As the bill made its way through congress, Warner worked behind the scenes, generating support and attention from such organizations as SAA, the American Historical Association and such figures as Barbara Tuchman, Alex Haley and Ed Meese. In June of 1984, the Senate passed the bill, followed by the House in August. After going to conference, the Senate and the House passed the revised bill on October 3 and 4, 1984, respectively. President Ronald Reagan signed the Act on October 19, 1984, creating the independent National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), effective April 1, 1985.</p>
      <p>Other highlights of Warner's years at NARS included the completion of a twenty-year preservation plan in 1984, the creation of a technology assessment division, the completion of the appraisal and retention plan for FBI records in 1981, controversy over the Richard Nixon Presidential papers, as well as the founding of the Carter Library and planning of the Ronald Reagan Library.</p>
      <p>By the end of 1984, Warner had decided to resign his position as Archivist of the U.S. in order to return to the University of Michigan, where he would become Dean of the School of Information and Library Studies (SILS). Warner stayed on at NARS until April 1985, after which he took up his new position at the University of Michigan. Under Warner's leadership, SILS revised its master and PhD programs and emphasized faculty research and minority hiring, moved to a new location at West Hall, fully re-organized its staff structure. From 1988 to 1991, Warner also served as acting director of the University of Michigan Library and was given the lifetime title of University Historian. He retired from the deanship in 1992, and was succeeded by Daniel Atkins.</p>
      <p>Warner spent one year teaching at the School of Library and Information Science at UCLA. He was also involved with the National Library of Education Task Force and actively served on the University of Michigan History and Traditions Committee. Warner also served on two General Accounting Office (GAO) committees, the Research and Education Panel (REAP) and the History Advisory Program, as well as the Foundation of the National Archives. From 1986 to 2007 Warner served on various boards and committees including the Executive Committee of the University of Michigan Library, Clarke Historical Library, Presbyterian Historical Society and others. He was also secretary for the Gerald R. Ford Foundation</p>
      <p>In 1995, Warner published a memoir on his experience at the National Archives called "Diary of a Dream." In 2005, Dr. Warner was honored for his lasting contribution to the National Archives with the naming of the Robert M. Warner Research Center at the newly renovated downtown building, in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>Warner died at age 79, on April 24, 2007 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

      <p>The Robert M. Warner Papers date from 1945 to 2007. These materials primarily highlight Warner's lengthy professional career, documenting his various teaching and administrative positions at the University of Michigan, his appointment as Archivist of the United States and the subsequent administration at the National Archives. Also documented is the appointment of his successor at the National Archives, his return to the University of Michigan as Dean of the School of Information and Library Science, and his activities on various boards and foundations after his retirement. Much of the records documenting his tenure as the director of the Michigan Historical Collections (now the Bentley Historical Library) can be found under the official Bentley Historical Library record group.</p>
      <p>The Robert M. Warner collection has been divided into ten series: Biography; Correspondence; Indian Court Claims; National Archives; School of Information and Library Science and Dean of the Michigan Library Systems; Teaching Materials and Scholarly Research; Professional Activities, Speeches; Scrapbooks and Scrapbook Materials, and Audio-Visual Material.</p>

            <p>The Diaries subseries (1.75 linear feet) consists primarily of transcriptions of dictations Warner made during his time at the National Archives (see the Audio Visual series for some of the actual cassette tapes). Warner reviewed and corrected many of the transcriptions and relied heavily on the diaries when writing his book <title render="italic">Diary of a Dream</title>. The early parts of this series are donor notes from traveling to visit donors for the Michigan Historical Collections in the 1960s and 1970s. Warner continued keeping a personal and professional diary though 2000. The Diaries are restricted until 2017.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series (5 linear feet) consists of both professional and personal correspondence. The first box consists of miscellaneous correspondence organized by date 1945-1993. The next two boxes consist of Warner's correspondence in the 1990s and maintains Warner's alphabetical arrangement. Included here is a folder dedicated solely to correspondence regarding Don Wilson, former Archivist of the United States whose career was tinged with controversy due to the Bush administration's threatened destruction of e-mail records in 1993. The fourth box holds letters from Jane to her Aunt between 1983-1985 and letters from Jane to her some Mark, known as "Bunkie" throughout the 1980s. These letters are frequent, from a few per month to a few per week, and describe Jane's personal activities, the whereabouts of the Warner family, as well as many aspects of Robert's professional life. The fourth box also holds a shoebox labeled "Daddy's Love Letters" (1949-1954 bulk 1952-1954), which mostly are from Robert to Jane and cover the period when he was in the Army stationed in Europe and his early time in Ann Arbor. There are also some letters from Jane to her parents in Ohio from the same vintage. The fifth box contains Personal Correspondence from Jane Warner to her mother and Aunt Eleanor Bullock ("Auntie") from 1962 to 1982. Researches can find official correspondence from Warner's time at the National Archives in the National Archives series.</p>

The materials, arranged topically and chronologically, include articles and position statements from 1981, statements and supporting documents for Warner's testimony on S. 905 (the National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1983) and the hearings on that bill. Miscellaneous materials related to the independence movement are divided into folders and arranged chronologically. One of these folders contains a key report produced as the result of a task force investigation on the status of the Smithsonian Institution, comparing it to the National Archives.</p>

            <p>The Presidential Libraries subseries contains materials relating to the Richard Nixon papers and library, and the Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan presidential libraries. Within each file, records are arranged chronologically. During Warner's years as Archivist, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library was established, while plans were underway for the Carter Library and discussions were just beginning on the Reagan library.</p>
            <p>Three folders contain Nixon materials, including those pertaining to the Nixon Presidential Materials Project. This project related to the then-recently passed Presidential Records Act, which stipulated that the papers of any President of the United States were federal property. The materials in these folders document the National Archives' efforts to gain custody of the Nixon papers. Included also are statements regarding presidential libraries which Warner made before two federal committees. A miscellaneous folder holds related materials covering the years 1983 and 1984, as well as a few undated items.</p>

            <p>The Post-National Archives materials are divided into two topical files, arranged chronologically. The first, dating from June 1985 to November 1987, consists of correspondence and article clippings on the process of appointing Warner's successor as Archivist of the United States. This material is significant for the insight it gives into the issue of the politicization of the position of Archivist of the U.S. Much of the material relates to the campaign to prevent John Agresto, the candidate first selected by President Reagan, from being appointed. The second topical file contains papers relating to the appointment of Don Wilson as seventh Archivist of the United States. Particularly noteworthy are Warner's remarks, which he delivered at the swearing-in of Wilson.</p>

          <p>The Professional Activities series (10 linear feet) documents Warner's professional participation with groups outside his main appointments at the Michigan Historical Collection, the Archives of the US, and as Dean at Michigan. Included are correspondence and administrative items from the Citizens Ambassador Program (for which he lead a team to China in 1986), the Foundation of the National Archives, the Gerald R. Ford Foundation, International Council of Archives, National Historical Publications and Records Commission, Society of American Archivists, and other professional boards and committees. The series also contains articles, clippings and correspondence relating to Presidential libraries, including one file for each existing Presidential Library and information on the Hiss Deposition of 1998 for which Warner submitted an affidavit. Also of note is a series of SAA questionnaires filled out by universities across the country that offered archives courses. Warner's Recommendation letters from this period are restricted until 2070.</p>

            <p>The Audio subseries (.5 linear feet) contains 69 cassettes and 5 mini cassettes. The cassettes range from the early 1970s to 2004. The earliest cassettes are unprofessional recordings of Warner on radio programs speaking about the archival profession. Many of the cassettes are diary entries that were later transcribed (see the Diary Series) and that are slightly different from the transcription. The diary recordings after 2000 were never transcribed. Other tapes are lectures, speeches, family recordings (Warner Christmas 1971), Concerts, and minutes from committee meetings he attended.</p>
