      <abstract>Ann Arbor-based artist specializing in images of local businesses and sites. The collection has been arranged in three series. The Artwork series includes drawings of buildings and other projects, publications containing reproductions of his work, and files relating to galleries, exhibits, auctions, and art fairs. The Supplemental Materials series concerns the art organizations and associations of which Kemnitz was a member, correspondence, and files pertaining to other activities, notably the Bird Hills Park controversy. The third series, Southern White Migration to Detroit in the 1930s, consists of research materials and reports resulting from Kemnitz' research as a member of a University of Michigan sociology seminar on metropolitan community organization. A portion includes Elmer Akers' research on the Black Legion.</abstract>

      <p>Milton Kemnitz is one of Ann Arbor's best known artists. His drawings and paintings all have a unique, identifiable style and have been widely reproduced -- on greeting cards, shopping bags, calendars and magazine covers. His work also appears on the walls of the city -- both inside and outside. In 1974 the mayor of Ann Arbor recognized his contributions and declared a "Milt Kemnitz Day."</p>
      <p>Kemnitz was born in Detroit, Michigan and graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree from the College of Literature, Arts and Sciences, in 1933. During World War II he served as a merchant seaman, and started to paint on a stint to the Mediterranean. Once the war was over, he returned to Ann Arbor, and together with his wife and collaborator Eddie, whom he married in 1939, has made the city his home ever since.</p>
      <p>His work has been shown in numerous group and one-man shows, mainly in galleries in his home state. The Forsythe Gallery in Ann Arbor represented him for decades, and he has had connections with many other galleries over the years. His work is in the collections of many museums, institutions and corporations. He has published several books of drawings: <title render="italic">Old West Side</title>, <title render="italic">Michigan Memories</title> (1965), <title render="italic">Ann Arbor Now and Then</title> (1972)and <title render="italic">London and Back</title> (1977). Eddie helped him design and edit the books, a role she often filled in conjunction with Milt's larger projects.</p>
      <p>Kemnitz did many commissioned pieces, especially drawings of buildings for individuals and corporations. In addition to these commissions, he often donated artwork or his expertise to support local activities. For instance, he sat on the Ann Arbor Sesquicentennial Committee and designed the commemorative silver bar, did lettering and drawings for the "Y" for over a decade, and helped keep The Ark, a local performance space, open.</p>
      <p>In addition to supporting the arts in Ann Arbor, an effort that included membership in the Ann Arbor Art Association and numerous other organizations, Eddie and Milt were involved in other local causes. The biggest effort was to "Save Bird Hills Park" in 1971. This was a grassroots effort to fight the building of luxury condominiums on what had been parkland. The city agreed to buy the land from the developer and leave it as parkland if the people of Ann Arbor could raise one-fourth of the purchase price. 1500 people pledged a total of $90,000 but the developer still got the land.</p>
      <p>His involvement with local organizations includes over fifty years of membership in the First Unitarian Universalist Church. Naturally, he did quite a bit of work for them over the years. In addition to his drawing of the church, which was used on programs and stationary for years, he experimented with a new medium and created a memorial stained glass window dedicated to Edward H. Redman, who had been minister from 1943 to 1960.</p>

      <p>The papers of Milt Kemnitz have been divided into three series. The first series, ARTWORK, focuses on the artwork itself, and its reproduction and dissemination. This includes the following subseries: Drawings of Buildings, Other Projects, Publications and Galleries, Exhibits, Auctions &amp; Art Fairs. The second series, called SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS, has three subseries, Art Organizations &amp; Associations, Correspondence and Miscellaneous Personal Material. Much of this material concerns his career as an artist but relates less directly to the actual artwork than the material in the first series. The third series, SOUTHERN WHITE MIGRATION TO DETROIT IN THE 1930s, consists of research materials and reports resulting from Kemnitz' research as a member of a University of Michigan sociology seminar on metropolitan community organization.</p>

          <p>Within the ARTWORK series, Drawings of Buildings includes drawings of private residences and well known public buildings, mainly in Ann Arbor. These folders contain sketches on tracing paper, photographs of the actual houses and reproductions of the final drawings. Many of the drawings of buildings were used as greeting card art. Kemnitz excelled at depicting buildings, typically as line drawings but sometimes as paintings. Other Projects are larger in scope, encompassing work Kemnitz did that may include, but are not limited to, the drawing of a building. Commissioned works have not been separated from gifts by the artist, for it is not always clear into which category a work falls. Publications includes the books Kemnitz published and the various magazine covers and articles reproducing his work. Please see the clippings folders in the SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS series for potentially relevant newspaper articles. Galleries, Exhibits, Auctions &amp; Art Fairs includes information about the various art events Kemnitz participated in.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The SOUTHERN WHITE MIGRATION TO DETROIT IN THE 1930s series dates mainly from 1936-1937 when Kemnitz, as part of a sociology course at the University of Michigan conducted interviews and made observations on the topic of the adjustment and life of Southern whites who migrated to the industrial North. The files provide some information on church life, the reaction of shop keepers and social agencies to the migrants, their work within the auto plants, and general living conditions. Of note is the information accumulated relating to activities of the Black Legion in Michigan. Some of these files were created by a classmate of Kemnitz, Elmer Akers.</p>
