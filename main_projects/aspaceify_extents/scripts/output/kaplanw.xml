    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Wilfred Kaplan, professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan from 1940 to 1986, was born November 28, 1915 in Boston Massachusetts to Jacob and Anne Kaplan. He attended Harvard University, where he completed his A.B. Degree in 1936 and his Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1939. Kaplan earned a Rogers Traveling Fellowship from Harvard University to study Mathematics in Europe during the 1936-1937 school terms. At ETH Zurich, in Zurich, Switzerland, he met Ida Roettinger in a mathematics course. He lovingly nicknamed her Heidi. The two were married in 1938. Professor Kaplan was an instructor at the College of William and Mary from 1939 to 1940, and came to the University of Michigan in 1940. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1944, to associate professor in 1950, and to full professor in 1956.</p>
      <p>Professor Kaplan's early research was concerned with the topological behavior of the solutions of differential equations. His research interests turned to complex function theory and in 1955, he introduced and studied a class of schlicht functions, and showed that the Bieberbach conjecture held for that class of functions. At the time it was a major result and the full Bieberbach conjecture was not proven until thirty years later. His later research centered in applied mathematics and global analysis of analytical differential equations.</p>
      <p>He was named collegiate professor for the period of 1973-1975 in recognition of his accomplishments as a teacher. Professor Kaplan's writings show the same clarity and directness that characterized his lectures. It was inevitable that he would turn his hand to writing texts in various areas of applied mathematics and intermediate analysis. The result was a series of very important and influential books. The titles of some of Kaplan's works are: <title render="italic">Advanced Calculus; Maxima and Minima with Applications: Practical Optimization and Duality; Operational Methods for Systems; Calculus and Linear Algebra;</title> and <title render="italic">Advanced Mathematics for Engineers.</title></p>
      <p>For over thirty years Professor Kaplan was continually active in the affairs of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). The AAUP is a national organization founded in 1915, dedicated to defending faculty rights, especially academic freedom and tenure. The University of Michigan Chapter was founded in the mid-1920s to protect professors from arbitrary dismissal and harassment; it assures due process when a professor is charged.</p>
      <p>During Kaplan's involvement with the University of Michigan Chapter of the AAUP, he helped establish the Academic Freedom Lecture Fund. The purpose of the AFLF is to protect academic and intellectual freedoms and to be reminded of their value and vulnerability.</p>
      <p>Wilfred Kaplan retired from active faculty status as of May 31, 1986, and was honored by the Regents as Professor Emeritus of Mathematics. In retirement Professor Kaplan was still active within the university community and served on the executive committee of the AAUP, on the AFLF board of directors, and as president of the University of Michigan Retirees Association. For many years, Kaplan was involved with the Ann Arbor Unitarian Fellowship serving in many offices including secretary/treasurer.</p>
      <p>Upon the death of his wife Ida "Heidi" Kaplan in 2005, Kaplan began the task of preserving and translating the correspondence between the couple from their first meeting in 1936 to their marriage in 1938. Initially, it was out of grief and for the benefit of family and friends that he organized the letters but the process evolved. The result was a two-volume book entitled <title render="italic">Heidi and Bill: Beginning of our Life Together</title>. A copy is currently held by the University of Michigan Shapiro Science Undergraduate Library under the call number: QA 29 .K315 A35 2005. With the book completed, Kaplan continued to organize, and in many cases translate, his entire collection of family correspondence, including those between Heidi and her family in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Wilfred Kaplan passed away December 26, 2007 following a short illness.</p>

      <p>The papers of Wilfred Kaplan consist of five and a half linear feet of materials. Those relating to his career at the University of Michigan Department of Mathematics date from 1958 to 1986. The materials involving the University of Michigan Chapter of the American Association of University Professors date from 1972 to 2000. The most heavily documented of these are from the years 1980 to 1995. The personal correspondence of the Kaplan family covers the years 1936-1956, 1958, 1962-1970, 1980-1981, and 1985. The papers are divided into three series with fifteen sub-series.</p>

          <p>The Personal Correspondence series contains personal letters, postcards, and telegrams of the Kaplan family covering the years 1936 to 1956, 1958, 1962 to 1970, 1980 to 1981, and 1985. The series is arranged chronologically under different sub-series. Given the time-span of the correspondence, many interesting insights into history are observable. Topics lightly discussed amongst family members include World War II, McCarthyism, President Kennedy's assassination, and the Vietnam War. The correspondence begins in 1936 during Kaplan's study abroad trip. The majority of the early letters and a significant amount of the later letters are in German. The sub-series "Bill to Heidi" encompasses the years 1936 to 1938, shortly after the pair met in Zurich, Switzerland. These letters are those that Bill wrote to Heidi as he continued his study abroad program in Europe. The sub-series "Heidi to Bill" are from the years 1936 to 1938 and are those letters Heidi wrote to Bill during his time abroad and his return to the United States. The Family Correspondence sub-series covers the years 1938 to 1956, 1962 to 1970, 1980 to 1981, and 1985. These letters, which commence following the marriage of Bill and Heidi in 1938, include those between the couple as well as those from or to them from their parents, siblings, and friends. The transcribed letters series features computer print-outs of the letters Kaplan worked to preserve and translate covering the years 1936 to 1957. The essays series features essays in German that Heidi and Bill wrote to each other during their courtship discussing topics such as; marriage, mathematics, and music. The personal diaries series includes Heidi's diary from a trip to Berkeley in 1960 and her diaries from the years 1970 and 1971.</p>
