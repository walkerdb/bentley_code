      <abstract>The D. James Galbraith Photographic Collection reflects D. James (Jim) Galbraith's career as a photographer, covering more than five decades and containing thousands of pictures in the form of prints, negatives, and slides about everyday life in rural Michigan.
The D. James Galbraith Photographic Collection is significant for its extensive photographic evidence of rural Michigan, particularly its emphasis on families, communities, and local institutions such as churches and schools. The collection is useful as a visual representation of late twentieth-century Michigan, capturing a wide array of social and cultural activities that highlight the daily experiences of Michigan residents.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>D. James (Jim) Galbraith (1930-2002) was a photographer who is noted for documenting life in Hartland, Michigan. Galbraith was born May 26, 1930 in Ann Arbor, Mich., and later attended Ann Arbor High School. At the onset of the Korean War, the United States Air Force drafted Galbraith into its ranks shortly after his graduation and stationed him in Alaska as an aerial photographer. He enrolled in courses at the University of Alaska (Fairbanks) but left before completing his degree.</p>
      <p>Galbraith used the photography skills he acquired in the military to begin a successful career as a photojournalist for the <title render="italic">Ann Arbor News</title>. His first published photograph, a picture of two men at the New York Central Railroad stop in Ann Arbor entitled "Waiting for the Morning Train," graced the newspaper's front cover on November 12, 1954. Galbraith spent the next three decades of his career with stints between the <title render="italic">Ann Arbor News</title>, the <title render="italic">Brighton Argus</title> and the <title render="italic">Livingston County Press</title>.</p>
      <p>During the course of his career, Galbraith also devoted time to several professional organizations, including the Hartland Art Council (Chairperson and Board Member), Metro Detroit News Photographers' Association (Vice President), and the Michigan Press Photographers' Association (President and Board of Directors). Other memberships included the Michigan Oral History Council, the Ann Arbor Art Association, and the American Association for State and Local History. In addition, Galbraith delivered guest lectures at the Center for Creative Studies (Detroit), the University of Michigan, and Washtenaw Community College.</p>
      <p>Following a successful career as a photojournalist, Galbraith embarked on a career as a commercial photographer, opening his own studio, Galbraith Photography, in East Jordan, Mich. His 1985 book <title render="italic">Hartland: Change in the Heart of America</title> garnered a Pulitzer Prize nomination for Photo documentary. His photographic work was accepted and displayed in countless juried art competitions across the country; among them the 1988 Ann Arbor State Street Art Festival for which he was awarded the Purchase Award. Galbraith photographed not only families, schools, churches throughout the state of Michigan but also was commissioned for artists such as Aaron Copland and Dame Judith Anderson.</p>
      <p>On July 21, 2002 Galbraith died in Antrim County, Mich. at the age of 72. Since his death, art galleries and art exhibitions have continued to showcase Galbraith's work.</p>

Covering the years 1960-2012 files in this series are arranged chronologically and cover everything from client recommendations to correspondence discussing Galbraith's Pulitzer Prize nomination. The materials generated after his 2002 death are primarily exhibit programs and descriptions gathered at public displays of his work.</p>

          <p>The Private Photography series is the most extensive within the collection and spans 1955-1994 with a majority of items undated. It is divided into the following subseries: Ann Arbor Weddings and Families; Clients; Commissions and Events; Life in Michigan; and <title render="italic">Mostly Michigan</title> Exhibit. The Ann Arbor Weddings and Families subseries is arranged chronologically. Many, but not all, individual photograph sleeves within folders contain labels indicating names and/or places. The Clients subseries has two arrangements, one chronological by year and the other alphabetical by name or topic. The photographs in this subseries are primarily slides and 4 x 5 negatives, though a few are 8 x 10 prints. The item's contents differ greatly, but one can find many family and school portraits in the subseries. The Commissions and Events subseries follows a chronological arrangement and includes entertainers such as Ruby Dee, Benny Goodman, and Bert Lahr and as well as literary figures such as Dudley Randall and Arthur Miller. The Life in Michigan subseries has 7 x 10 and 8 1/2 x 11 prints from Galbraith's travels through Michigan. There are no dates attached to any of the folders or items in the subseries.</p>

          <p>The Oversize series contains materials from both the Business Records and Private Photography series. These items retain the intellectual order of their originating series (Business Records or Private Photography), and can be found in both locations within the finding aid. The only exception is the <title render="italic">Mostly Michigan</title> Exhibit subseries, which consists of 16 x 20 framed pictures from an exhibit of Galbraith's work on display in Charlevoix, Michigan. Some of the images in this subseries are in color while others are in black and white.</p>
