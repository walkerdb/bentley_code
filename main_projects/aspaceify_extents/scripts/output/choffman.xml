      <abstract>Republican congressman from Michigan's 4th Congressional District, 1934-1962, served on the Education and Labor Committee and the Government Operations Committee, known for his fiscal conservatism and opposition to much of the New Deal legislation, he was particularly concerned with the growing power of labor unions and worked to amend the Wagner Act, eventually becoming a key player in passage of the Taft-Hartley Act. As chair of special subcommittees, Hoffman conducted several investigations into labor racketeering, particularly by the Teamsters Union. Collection includes committee files, some constituent correspondence, topical files, investigation files, press releases, scrapbooks and a limited number of sound recordings and photographs.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Clare E. Hoffman was born at Vicksburg, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 1875. He was educated in Constantine, Michigan, where his parents had moved when he was one year old. He graduated from Northwestern University Law School in 1895, and then attended Valparaiso University. He was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1896 and immediately took up the practice of law in Allegan, Michigan.</p>
      <p>After thirty years of local legal practice, punctuated by two terms as prosecuting attorney for Allegan County, Hoffman decided to run for Congress as a Republican from the Fourth Congressional District (the six-county western Michigan district). He was elected in 1934 (defeating the Democratic incumbent), and reelected for the next thirteen terms, serving through 1962 (from the 74th to the 87th Congresses).</p>
      <p>Elected during Franklin Roosevelt's first term, Hoffman developed a reputation as an outspoken, even caustic, critic of the New Deal, and of those programs which appeared to Hoffman to represent an encroachment on the prerogatives of the states and the rights of the individual. Hoffman was especially concerned about the growing power of trade unions resulting from the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (often called the Wagner Act). He worked tirelessly to amend this legislation and to incorporated his views into all subsequent labor-related legislation. With his growing seniority, and his membership on the House Committee on Education and Labor, Hoffman's became a potent voice in the debate over the passage of the Taft-Hartley Law after the war.</p>
      <p>Hoffman also served for a time on the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the House Committee on Agriculture, but it was primarily because of his position on the Education and Labor Committee and the Government Operations Committee that he wielded his greatest influence.</p>
      <p>The House Committee on Government Operations was formerly the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Department. As ranking Republican member, Hoffman for two terms was committee chairman, and became noted for his fiscal conservatism and his efforts to bring efficiency and order to the bureaucracy of the federal executive. He perhaps made his greatest contributions in the passage into law of the Reorganization Plan that authorized the creation and activities of the so-called Hoover Commission. He also played an important part in the passage of the Armed Forces Unification Act.</p>
      <p>Hoffman retired from Congress in 1963. He died November 3, 1967.</p>

      <p>The Clare E. Hoffman Papers consist of Congressional files detailing his work on the House Committee on Education and Labor, the House Committee on Government Operations, and various subcommittees, including investigating labor racketeering; files concern in part his sponsorship of labor-related legislation, bills unifying the armed services, and bills authorizing reorganization of the executive branch; and photographs.</p>
      <p>The Hoffman collection of congressional papers covers the years 1934-1962. Unfortunately the first few terms of his service are not as adequately documented as might be hoped, as in 1942 Hoffman directed his staff to discard retired files. As a result, except for a few political files and subject files, the Hoffman collection bulks largest for the years 1943-1962.</p>
      <p>Despite the fragmentary character of the documentation on Hoffman's early years in Congress, the collection provides a detailed view of the activities of a conservative congressman from western Michigan for a twenty-year period. In recent American history, the years 1943-1962 were important both for wartime politics and for the myriad problems that came after victory: the cooling of relations with the Soviet Union, the integration of returning veterans into the economy, shortages in housing and consumer goods, a renewed militancy among the nation's labor unions, the continuation of the struggle for civil rights for blacks, the fear of internal subversive activities; in short, problems of great importance and complexity, issues for which there were no easy answers.</p>
      <p>Hoffman was eyewitness and participant to the politics of these issues. As a representative of increasing seniority, he was a powerful conservative voice within the Congress. Because of his position on the Education and Labor committee, he helped shape the bulk of legislation passed in the postwar period, notably the Taft-Hartley Act. And because of his position on the Expenditures Committee, Hoffman was instrumental in passage of the National Security Act of 1947 that unified the administration of the armed services and enlarge their responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Apart from these major pieces of legislation, the Hoffman collection documents the service of a congressman who was attuned to the concerns and politics of his largely rural and small-town district, with constituents economically conservative and ever distrustful of federal encroachments upon their lives. Of special interest are various files of correspondence with the businessmen and small manufacturers of his district. As a good politician, Hoffman was especially mindful of maintaining good relations with these people, and helping them when he could with their labor-related problems.</p>
      <p>Like many congressional collections, the Hoffman papers consist in large part of communications with constituents and out-of-district citizens. But because of his power within the Congress, Hoffman's files (letters received and sent) are often substantive in content and a valuable complement to the work of the House, as published in the Congressional Record and other printed sources.</p>

          <p>These are a miscellanea of files that somehow escaped Hoffman's decision to discard retired materials in 1942. Despite their scattered character, these files are nevertheless substantive in content, relating in great part to Hoffman's criticism of the Wagner Act and the workings of the National Labor Relations Board. These files concern cases of companies experiencing strikes or other labor difficulties. In 1939, for example, Hoffman visited the Appalachian coal fields and kept files for each of the companies he investigated. These Combined Files also document Hoffman's reputation as an anti-New Deal, Anti-Roosevelt, anti-union critic. His activities led to well-publicized confrontations with columnist Walter Winchell for one, and these Hoffman files have much information from, or about, individuals representing both ends of the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>Biennial (except for 1944 through 1946), the General Files series is comprised of correspondence documenting the relationships Hoffman maintained within his district, frequently with small businessmen and with local manufacturers. These files are arranged alphabetically, primarily by name of individual or organization, although there are general category file headings such as: Complaints, Hoffman House Talks, and Newspapers.</p>

          <p>Biennial for the period covered, the Legislative Files files document Hoffman's work during a specific term of Congress. The files are arranged alphabetically by broad subject heading with sub-divisions where warranted. Consisting mainly of correspondence both with constituents and out-of-district citizens, these files reflect the concerns of Hoffman's correspondents on the issues of the day and the legislation pending before the House. The subjects covered most completely by these files are obviously those areas where Hoffman, because of his interest and committee membership, could claim some expertise. Such subjects include--but are not limited to --Agriculture, Labor, Military, Government Reorganization, and Executive Expenditures. The researcher should note especially files 1947-1948, relating to the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act, and the investigations made by a Hoffman-chaired subcommittee of the House Education and Labor Committee investigating strikes in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. There is also much material relating to an anti-racketeering subcommittee, 1953-1954, and to the various hearings it held (notably in Kansas City and Minneapolis). The researcher should be alerted to Hoffman's Committee files (boxes 81-88; described elsewhere) which overlap with the files in this Legislative series concerning Hoffman's committee work. Both files should be used for any legislative study.</p>

          <p>A biennial series, except for 1938-1942, the Bills File is arranged sequentially, beginning first with House Resolutions, and after that with the House Bills. These files concern primarily resolution and legislation introduced by Hoffman. Files consisting of only the printed copy of the bill have been eliminated. These are Hoffman's working files and contain background correspondence, memoranda, and drafts showing changes in the proposed legislation.</p>

          <p>Consisting of yearly files for 1934 and 1936-1946, and then biennially thereafter, the Political Files includes the earliest extant Hoffman papers. The files for the 1930s consist primarily of copies of Hoffman's newspaper advertisements and campaign brochures, and political speeches. In 1940 the character of the files changes to include correspondence, political mailings, speeches, and general campaign materials. To be noted here are files maintained by Hoffman of his interaction with the six Republican county committees that fell within his district. These files also document Hoffman's relationship with the Republican State Central Committee, the national Republican party, and various other Republican organizations.</p>

          <p>Arranged alphabetically by name of city, the Post Office series is a selection of the files maintained by Hoffman documenting the politics behind the selection of postmasters for the numerous post offices within his district. As the selection process was often routine and of like character, this file has been sifted to include the larger cities in each of his six counties and a sampling of the smaller post offices.</p>

          <p>The Committee Files, 1947-1962, consist of administrative and investigative records from Hoffman's service on the House Committee on Government Operations (formerly called the Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments). The committee's chief responsibility was to oversee the operation of the executive departments and propose legislative or other methods to control departmental expenditures and increase efficiency. The Committee had broad investigative powers. Hoffman was the senior Republican member of the Committee from 1947 to 1962 and served as chairman in the 80th and 83rd Congresses.</p>
          <p>The files have been arranged by Congress and thereunder by committee and subcommittee. The records include correspondence, minutes, press releases, reports, and topical investigative material. The bulk of the material is from the 83rd Congress, in particular the special Anti-Racketeering Subcommittee. The Anti-Racketeering series is a combined file of three subcommittees on which Hoffman served, a joint subcommittee of the Government Operations and the Labor and Education Committees, a special subcommittee of the Government Operation Committee, chaired by Hoffman, and another subcommittee, chaired by George Bender. These subcommittees conducted a number of investigations on labor union racketeering and corruption, including Teamsters insurance and health and welfare funds, the juke box industry, Washington, D.C. painters union and racketeer-influenced unions in a number of cities.</p>
          <p>Several of the subseries in the Committee files series include photographic exhibits resulting from various labor investigations, primarily of companies on strike. There are also photos illustrating erosion of the Lake Michigan shoreline, 1947-1952, photos of the Hamilton Farm Bureau, Hamilton, Michigan, produce plant and related operation, and photo of the Ford Motor strike of 1941.</p>
