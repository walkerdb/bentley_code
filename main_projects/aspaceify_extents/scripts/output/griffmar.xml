    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Martha W. Griffiths was born in Pierce City, Missouri in 1912. She received her A.B. from the University of Missouri in 1934 and her J.D. degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1940. She began practicing law in 1941 but soon turned her attention to Michigan politics (where she had moved) and began seeking public office. She was a member of the Michigan State Legislature from 1948 to 1952, a judge of Detroit's Recorder's Court, 1953 to 1954, and from 1955 to 1974, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Following her retirement from the House, Griffiths continued in her advocacy of women's issues, particularly the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1982, she was elected to the office of Lieutenant Governor of Michigan where she served with Governor James Blanchard. She was re-elected in 1986, but was not renominated in 1990. As the Martha Griffiths papers consists solely of files created when serving within the Congress, this biographical note will emphasize Griffiths' service and contributions within that body.</p>
      <p>Griffiths represented the people of the seventeenth congressional district of Michigan for ten terms, the 84th through the 93rd Congress. Her first assignments were on the Banking and Currency Committee and the Government Operations Committee. In 1961, she was appointed a member of the Joint Economic Committee of the House and the Senate, which was an advisory group to the Congress similar to the President's Council of Economic Advisors. Within this group, Griffiths was named chair of the Subcommittee on Fiscal Policy. In 1962, Griffiths was elected a member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, then under the chairmanship of Wilbur Mills. The Ways and Means Committee was responsible for financial bills, including those relating to federal tax policy.</p>
      <p>In Congress, Griffiths was an ardent Democrat and supporter of legislation aimed at improving education, health, conservation, and social security benefits. Griffiths also championed women's issues. She sought through legislation to remove inequities in the payment of social security benefits and other government programs. And from 1959 until her retirement from office, she sponsored a resolution in the House proposing an equal rights amendment to the Constitution.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Griffiths collection consists primarily of correspondence exchanged with constituents and lobbying groups on matters of pending or proposed legislation and on topics of current interest. The collection's great value is its documentation of the workings of this one congressional office and its perspective on the issues confronting the nation in the period of 1955 to 1974. With the Democrats in control of the Congress, these years witnessed legislative efforts to use the power of the Federal Government to rectify the ills of society on matters of civil rights, assistance to the poor, health care for the aged, environmental protection, and so forth. It was also a time of strife in society resulting from the war in Vietnam, tension among the races, and the Watergate crisis. The Griffiths collection documents these issues with letters from constituents and her response to the concerns of the people.</p>
      <p>Beyond general issues, the Griffiths papers have importance for their documentation of the specific contribution of this one woman member of Congress, who served for twenty years, and who was rewarded by her colleagues with increasingly responsible committee positions. Especially significant was her appointment to the powerful Ways and Means Committee under the chairmanship of Wilbur Mills. Griffiths' files from her work on W and Means Committee detail the major pieces of tax reform legislation of the 1960s, notably Griffiths' efforts to legislate some equity into the benefits accorded to American women.</p>
      <p>The Martha W. Griffiths papers, with few exceptions, have been maintained in the arrangement scheme used by the Griffiths office.</p>

          <p>Congressional Papers make up the great bulk of the collection. This series is divided into subseries for each two-year congressional term (84th Congress, etc.) and then subdivided into the following sub-subseries: Legislative Files, Bills Files, and Topical Files. For Griffiths' first two terms in Congress, however, because of the relative paucity of materials, these three sequences of material have been combined into one.</p>
          <p>The Legislative Files sub-subseries is arranged alphabetically by committee name. The most voluminous files are for those committees on which Griffiths served, especially Ways and Means. The files are further divided by topic, usually a specific piece of legislation then under discussion within that committee's responsibility. These subdivisions have not been listed within this finding aid. The files consist of correspondence between Griffiths and her constituents or other parties interested in the legislation. Some of the larger files have been sampled because of the sameness of the letters received and of Griffiths' response.</p>
          <p>The Bills Files sub-subseries consists of files for those pieces of legislation either introduced by Griffiths or of which she was a co-sponsor. Although there is also much constituent correspondence here, the files are more substantive than the Legislative files in that they show the development of the legislation. The files usually include a copy of the bill and related background information. The Bills file for the 92nd Congress has not been received by the library.</p>
          <p>The Topical Files sub-subseries is an alphabetically arranged sequence of materials relating to issues, government departments, or individuals. The sub-subseries does not pertain to specific legislation but is a more general file for constituent expressions of complaint or concern. Some of the larger files pertain to issues of race relations, busing, the war in Vietnam, the contemplated impeachment of President Nixon, women's issues, such as the Equal Rights Amendment, and Griffiths' interest in a national health insurance plan.</p>

            <p>The films are part of a "Report from Washington" series, in which Griffiths reported to her constituents on issues before Congress or matters of special concern to her district. The films are all 16 mm., black &amp; white with sound, ca. 5 minutes in duration. The films are listed in chronological order and have numbered for identification, missing numbers were duplicates that have been removed from the collection.) The films were digitized in 2008 and DVD use copies and streaming files wee created. Some streaming files are currently online, others can be mounted online by request to the library reference staff.</p>

        <p>The Griffiths collection is unlike other congressional collections within the library in that certain kinds of materials were not received by the library and presumably were retained by the congresswoman. These include staff files, political or campaign files, speeches, and press files. Although Griffiths and her staff created a series of scrapbooks detailing her activities in Congress and for the two years following (1961-1963 and 1970-1976), her collection does not include a run of newsletters or press releases. According to Griffiths' biographer, Emily George, the congresswoman has retained "family memorabilia and political mementos," files of speeches, scrapbooks, newsletters, and her voting record in the Congress.</p>
