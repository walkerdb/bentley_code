    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Philip Ernest Converse was born in Concord, New Hampshire, on November 17, 1928. He attended Denison University in Granville, Ohio, where he earned a B.A. in English in 1949. The following year he received a master's degree in English literature from the State University of Iowa. Six years later, after a period of study in France, he enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1956 to pursue his interest in the social sciences, and earned a M.A. in sociology in 1956, followed by a Ph.D. in social psychology in 1958. In 1951, he married Jean G. McDonnell, a social scientist expert in interviewing techniques.</p>
      <p>Converse joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor of sociology in 1960, was appointed associate professor of political science in 1963, and associate professor of sociology in 1964. Quick to establish a reputation as an outstanding social psychologist and empirical political scientist, he was appointed professor of sociology and political science in 1965. He was named the Robert C. Angell Professor of Political Science and Sociology in 1975, and Robert Cooley Angell Distinguished University Professor of Political Science and Sociology in 1982. He was selected as the 1987 Henry Russel Lecturer, the University's highest honor given to a senior faculty member. The University of Michigan Research Club, when nominating Converse for the award, summarized his contributions by noting, "Professor Converse made many contributions to the development of the Michigan Program, which 25 years ago revolutionized political science research. The great innovation of this program was its heavy emphasis on quantitative methods applied to empirical research, in general, and to survey research, in particular. It was unique at that time, but subsequently became the model copied in numerous other departments in this country and in Europe. This 'movement' brought political science into much closer intellectual contact with sociology, social psychology and economics."</p>
      <p>Converse is also well known for his work with the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research (ISR). Converse began his affiliation with the institute as assistant study director of the Survey Research Center in 1956, and by 1986 had been appointed director of the institute. While en route to the directorship he headed several of the institute's important components. In 1962 he was named associate director of the Inter-university Consortium for Political Research, a partnership between the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan and several other universities in the United States. He was named program director of the Survey Research Center in 1965, and director of the Center for Political Studies in 1982. When he assumed his duties as institute director, he did so at a crucial time when federal funds for social research were being slashed. The institute relies almost entirely on non-university grants and contracts to carry on its work, and he was instrumental in securing a number of new funding sources. He also strengthened the ties between the institute and the university by drawing on the research skills of university professors from various departments and schools.</p>
      <p>Converse is the author of numerous books and articles on a wide range of political and sociological topics. Many of his works are considered standards in their fields. His book <title render="italic">The American Voter</title> (coauthored with Angus Campbell, Warren E. Miller and Donald E. Stokes) is considered a classic. It pioneered the use of new methods to describe voting behavior in the United States. <title render="italic">Vietnam and the Silent Majority</title> (coauthored with Milton Rosenberg and Sidney Verba) and <title render="italic">The Human Meaning of Social Change</title> (with Angus Campbell) were innovative works in group political behavior. <title render="italic">The Quality of American Life</title> (coauthored with Angus Campbell) studied Americans' sense of well-being. His work not only encompasses the United States but other nations as well, such as his award-winning <title render="italic">Political Representation in France</title> (coauthored with Roy Pierce). His articles have appeared in a variety of well-known scholarly books and journals. Among his most influential articles are, "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics," which has had enormous influence on research in the field of political ideology, and "Of Time and Partisan Stability," which demonstrated the linkage between family socialization and individual partisan identification.</p>
      <p>In addition to his research contributions, Converse has made distinguished contributions as a statesman of the social sciences. He has served on numerous committees of the many professional, public service, and honorary organizations in which he is active. These include The American Political Science Association, The American Sociological Association, The Social Science Research Council, and The National Research Council. He was president of the American Political Science Association in 1983-84 and of the International Society of Political Psychology in 1980-81.</p>
      <p>Converse has received many awards during his career. He has received honorary doctorate degrees from Denison University and the University of Chicago, and has been awarded numerous fellowships, including the Fulbright, Guggenheim, and Russell Sage. He is an elected member of such notable societies as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, The American Philosophical Society, and the National Academy of Science.</p>
      <p>Converse left the University of Michigan in 1989 to become director of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California. He was chosen from a field of some 150 candidates in a nationwide search for a new director. The independent research center is near the campus of Stanford University, and is considered one of the nation's most prestigious "think tanks."</p>

            <p>Biography (8 folders) consists of background material on Converse, including vitae, bibliographies, completed questionnaires, congratulatory letters, outside employment offers, book reviews, and newspaper articles. Materials relating to his applications for various fellowships are contained in this series and include brief autobiographical career accounts. In 1987, Converse's wife, Jean, authored <title render="italic">Survey Research in the United States: Roots and Emergence, 1890-1960</title>. Two chapters from her book which detail the origins of the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, are included in this series. The biographical materials are, on the whole, particularly helpful in reconstructing the various stages of Converse's career and outlining his major research accomplishments.</p>

          <p>Correspondence (4.5 linear feet) is the largest of the series, and is divided into three sub-series: Chronological, Organizations, and Electronic Mail. Chronological consists of both incoming and outgoing correspondence and is arranged by year. Correspondents include scientists in Converse's field, as well as miscellaneous groups and organizations. The Organizations sub-series is comprised of incoming and outgoing correspondence which Converse conducted on a large scale with organizations with which he was affiliated. The sub-series is arranged alphabetically by organization name. The majority of it concerns the International Society of Political Psychology, which Converse has been affiliated with since its inception. The third sub-series consists of paper copies of incoming and outgoing University of Michigan electronic mail messages from 1987-1989, when Converse was director of the Institute for Social Research. It is chronologically arranged.</p>

          <p>Teaching Materials (0.5 linear feet) includes syllabi, examinations, lecture notes, and teaching evaluations from Converse's tenure in both the political science and sociology departments. The series is arranged by topic and mostly documents the years 1960-1986. Lecture notes are sporadic and exist primarily from the early 1960s. Examinations are comprised of copies of midterm, final, and doctoral examinations administered by Converse from 1965 to 1985. Teaching evaluations include computerized questionnaire forms and tally sheets, and remarks written by students regarding the quality of Converse's teaching. Evaluations exist for the years 1972 to 1983.</p>

          <p>Study Materials (2 linear feet) are divided into two sub-series: Domestic Studies and International Studies. The division represents the different scopes of Converse's studies. The files are arranged chronologically and include instruction booklets, questionnaires, and project codes used in computing and tallying responses. Background material and relevant correspondence is filed with the study to which it pertains. (The researcher should note that the series Grant Proposals also includes materials on studies which received funding). Domestic Studies include those related to elections, time budgeting, and quality of life, and date from 1958 to 1986, although materials from as far back as 1948 are also present. The Quality of Life study is the most thoroughly documented. International Studies include political studies conducted in France, in other European countries, and in Latin America. In several of these international studies, Converse served as the project coordinator, overseeing the field work of others. Correspondence with the field workers comprise a large portion of the materials, particularly those from the French studies (most of the correspondence is in French).</p>

          <p>Administrative Files (2 linear feet) reflect the administrative side of Converse's career. The series is divided into two sub-series: University Committees and Institute for Social Research. The sub-series University Committees is arranged alphabetically and documents membership in various university administrative committees and councils, primarily from 1985 to 1988. The majority of materials concern the Classified Research Committee. The Institute for Social Research sub-series is arranged alphabetically and covers the years 1963 to 1989. It broadly documents Converse's duties as director, and includes important reports from the 1986 visiting committee which was headed by James Tobin and reviewed ISR operations, and financial and budgetary materials. Also included are files from the institute's various component groups with which Converse was closely associated: the Center for Political Studies, the Survey Research Center, and the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research.</p>

          <p>Grant Proposals (1 linear foot) consists of reports and proposals submitted for grant funding, usually to the National Science Foundation. They are arranged chronologically and span 1962-1987. Most reports include summaries of research as well as general statements supporting the merits of the proposed research. Itemized budgets and researcher profiles complete the reports. In some instances evaluations of the proposals by outside reviewers are included. (It should be noted that many of the proposals were joint efforts involving contributions from multiple faculty members, some of which involved Converse only minimally.) This series also includes several of Converse's reviews of proposals submitted by researchers at other institutions. His reviews provide criticism and evaluation along with recommendations as to whether to approve funding. The file containing the reviews is listed at the end of the series. It is closed pending review of applicable laws.</p>
