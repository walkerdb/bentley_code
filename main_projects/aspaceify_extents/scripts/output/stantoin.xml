      <p>Theodore St. Antoine, currently James E. and Sarah A. Degan Professor Emeritus of Law, has been an acknowledged expert in labor relations law since the late 1960s, and is a practicing labor arbitrator. He has also distinguished himself with a full service record, participating in and leading numerous committees, councils and other organizations in the labor law field as well as at the University of Michigan, including guiding the Law School as Dean from 1971 through 1978. He is married to Elizabeth Lloyd (Frier), and they have four children.</p>
      <p>Theodore St. Antoine was born in Vermont on May 29, 1929. He graduated from Fordham University in 1951 with a degree in philosophy and theology, and from the University of Michigan Law School in 1954, having served as editor-in-chief of the Michigan Law Review. He did post-graduate work with a Fulbright Grant at the London School of Economics, and on his return to the United States, he practiced in Cleveland and the U.S. Army, and then in Washington D.C. with the firm Woll, Mayer and St. Antoine. In 1965, after seven years in D.C., he joined the University of Michigan Law School faculty, teaching courses in contracts, and labor and employment law.</p>
      <p>As Dean of the Law School from 1971 through 1978, he raised the funds for the underground law library addition, and saw it through the ground-breaking in 1978. His wisdom and even-handedness, and his flawless negotiating skills, are celebrated in his roles as both teacher and administrator. His students for years have called him "The Saint."</p>
      <p>Though limited by university policy to ten to fifteen cases a year, St. Antoine also practices labor arbitration through the Michigan Employment Relations Bureau, the National Arbitrators Academy (NAA), and the American Arbitration Association. Several of his opinions have been published, and he is often cited in other arbitrators' decisions. He participates in an executive capacity in arbitration societies, and served as president of the NAA during the 1999/2000 term.</p>
      <p>St. Antoine's other public service activities include both university-related and outside work. He was presented with a Distinguished Faculty Governance Award in 1996 in recognition of his service at the university, beginning in the 1970s as chair of the University Council and as a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Permanent Judiciary, then as President of the Research Club in 1989-1990, and as chair of the Faculty Senate's Academic Affairs Advisory Committee, among other positions.</p>
      <p>Outside of the university, St. Antoine has served as Secretary and Council member for the Labor and Employment Law Section of the American Bar Association, as chair of the Labor Law Section of the Michigan State Bar, and as chair of the UAW-GM Legal Services Plan. In January of 2000, he received the Distinguished Service Award from the Labor and Employment Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan. He was the reporter, or principal draftsman, of the Model Employment Termination Act for the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL), which he worked on from 1987 through 1992. The NCCUSL passed the model act in 1992, despite much initial contention, but it was not widely adopted.</p>
      <p>St. Antoine is currently a member of the UAW's Public Review Board, and a member of the U.S. Executive Board of the International Society for Labor Law and Social Security. His casebook, Labor Relations Law, is in its tenth edition.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Arbitration Case Files contain a non-random sample of a twenty-five linear foot series in the original accession. The files selected document the arbitration cases which were published, thus ensuring that the parties do not expect the complete confidentiality of the record of the arbitration proceedings. There are three cases represented here: a 1970 case between the City of Birmingham (Michigan) and the City of Birmingham Firefighters, a 1985 grievance by UFCW (United Food and Commercial Workers) Local 876 against Kroger, and the Wayne State Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) grievance against Wayne State University in 1975.</p>

            <p>In the Birmingham Firefighters proceedings, St. Antoine arbitrated the reasonable settlement of disputes about the new contract between the firefighters and the city. The primary contentious issues were whether or not to institute an agency shop, and whether arbitration should be the final recourse for the resolution of grievances (rather than the city commission, which was assumed to have an obvious bias.) In St. Antoine's decision, he found the agency shop unnecessary, but instituted the final arbitration clause.</p>

            <p>The grievance of UFCW Local 876 against Kroger was that the labor contract mandated the store be closed on New Years' Day, yet Kroger remained open in 1985 in response to the same action by competitors, which the company claimed was contractually allowed. St. Antoine found for the union.</p>

          <p>The series Articles, Speeches, Appearances and Conferences contains files of St. Antoine's writings and conference correspondence from two accessions--one from 1988, (the bulk of this accession otherwise remains in the Law School record group, and pertains to St. Antoine's duties as dean), and one from 1999. The earlier accession contains files for the years 1967 through 1978, and are arranged chronologically. The files from the 1999 accession were split into two groups--By Title or Subject and By Conference or Venue. All of the writings found here were the result of St. Antoine's participation in conferences, or appearance at other functions, though not all of the files of the various conferences contain any writings. The writings are represented variously by rough notes, outlines, typed manuscripts, or published proceedings or law review reprints.</p>

          <p>The largest series is Public Service/Committee Work, and contains the files of some of St. Antoine's most important and well-known work. Found here is documentation of his participation in American Bar Association and Michigan State Bar Association committees, of his (donated) time as Michigan Governor's (James Blanchard) Special Counselor on Workers' Compensation, and of his chairmanship of the UAW-GM Legal Services Plan, for example. These files often contain correspondence, research notes, memoranda, and reports.</p>
