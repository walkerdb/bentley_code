      <p>The College of Dental Surgery at the University of Michigan was founded by the Regents in 1875. The practicing dentists of the state were instrumental in its creation. They had originally petitioned the Regents in 1866 for the establishment of a chair of dentistry. When that petition failed to win regental approval, dentists submitted another petition in 1873. The Regents expressed a willingness to approve this second request, but claimed lack of funds made action impossible. The dentists then turned to the state legislature where they were successful in obtaining a special appropriation for the purpose of teaching dentistry at the university.</p>
      <p>Originally dentistry was taught by two professors. They, and those subsequently appointed to the faculty, developed a college noted for the adeptness of its graduates in technical and operative areas. Throughout the nineteenth century the college's focus was primarily on technique, but at the beginning of the twentieth century research began to assume an important position in the college's activities. The first major project was undertaken by Marcus Ward, who in 1903 began a study of the properties of dental amalgams used as filling material. Research was also carried on in areas of surgical procedures, with particular success in the area of restoration. Eventually, research became a common activity among the faculty.</p>
      <p>Throughout the twentieth century the nature of the student body and the character of the subjects taught developed and changed. In 1921 dental hygiene was first taught, largely to women who would go on to become dental assistants and technicians. By 1927, when the college was renamed the School of Dentistry, the need for both continuing education for practicing dentists and for post-graduate educational opportunities for students had been recognized and was being acted upon. The W. K. Kellogg foundation was particularly instrumental during the 1930s and 1940s in making funds and space available for these two activities.</p>
      <p>Space was a continuing problem for the school. When it was founded, the school was placed in a university-owned house, originally used as a faculty residence. In 1877 the school was relocate into a larger building, another university-owned house originally used by a faculty member. In 1891 the school inherited the old university Hospital. During 1908 and 1909 a special building was erected for the Dental School, on North University Avenue. This building was enlarged in 1923. In 1939-1940, with funds supplied by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation and the Works Progress Administration, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation Institute: Graduate and Postgraduate Dentistry Building was constructed. In 1969, as part of a major construction program initiated the year before, the 1908 structure was razed. It was replaced by a complex of buildings completed in 1971.</p>

      <p>The School of Dentistry record group spans the years from 1873 to 2010, but does not comprehensively document the entire span. The records are fragmentary, providing only a partial picture of the School of Dentistry. Documentation reflects the tenures of various deans with scattered documents from the late 1800s and more detail in the period 1920-1990. The records give some insight into the development of dentistry as a profession, and the training and education of dental students. The records, comprised of 33.5 linear feet, have been divided into nine series: Educational Information, Administration, Organizations, Surveys, Photographs and Audiovisual Materials, Department Chairpersons' Meetings, Faculty Meetings, American Dental Association Accreditation, Dental Research Institute, and Website</p>

          <p>The series Educational Information brings together information about the history of the school, its educational programs and curriculum, departments within the school, work with students, and some student notebooks and related material collected by the school over the years. Also included are some interesting publications and speeches by dentistry professors from other universities. Information on departments within the School of Dentistry reflects the structure of the school and activities of the departments from the 1960s through the 1980s.</p>
          <p>An outsize ledger volume of unknown provenance that was donated to the School of Dentistry, details the dental practice of Dr. James [likely in Kalamazoo, Michigan]. The volume contains patient records from this practice dating from 1873 to 1895.</p>
          <p>The Educational Information series is comprised of two chronologically defined subseries, 1875-1989 and ca. 1956- 1997, reflecting different accessions. The 1956- 1997 subseries is restricted under Executive Offices rule.</p>

          <p>The series Administration (1899-1999, 14.3 linear feet) includes administrative information on topics such as admissions, interaction with other university units, committees, evaluations of faculty and administration, reports, and finances during the period from 1899 to 1999. In addition, this series contains records from eight deans of the School of Dentistry: Russell W. Bunting, Paul H. Jeserich, William R. Mann, Marcus L. Ward, Robert E. Doerr, Richard L. Christiansen, William Kotowicz, and J. Bernard Machen. The Dean's files are comprised mainly of correspondence, although some speeches and publications and a small amount of biographical information will also be found here. Other material in this series includes background on the W. K. Kellogg Foundation Institute, and information on dental activities in Latin America covering 1944-1974.</p>

          <p>The Faculty Meetings series (1899-1994, 2 linear feet) document administrative issues central to the School of Dentistry. Issues covered include curriculum, finances, tenure and promotion, and clinical services. The volumes (1899-1979) of faculty meeting minutes offer the most comprehensive picture of dental education at the University of Michigan. The folders (1967-1994) contain agendas and minutes that document discussions about significant issues. The material from the 1980s and 1990s focuses mostly on budget and financial issues, clinical services, and the status of lecturers and instructors. Other topics include the development of new graduate programs, department reports and updates, discussion and approval of various policies and procedures, bylaw revisions, introductions of new faculty members, and results of votes for committee appointments.</p>

          <p>The American Dental Association Accreditation series (1942-2002, 1.5 linear feet) documents the School of Dentistry's participation in the American Dental Association (ADA) accreditation process. The series is divided into two subseries: General (1942-2002) and Specialties (1978-1987). The General subseries contains correspondence, self-evaluations, and final reports from the 1970s and 1980s, an internal review from 2002, and a survey of dental schools from 1942-1943. The Specialties subseries includes progress reports and accreditation manuals for the Dental Hygiene, Endodontics, Orthodontics, and Prosthodontics programs within the School of Dentistry.</p>
