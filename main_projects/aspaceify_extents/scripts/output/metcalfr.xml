        <p>As received by the Bentley, the client files for each architectural project were labeled with a job number, but filed alphabetically by client name, while the architectural drawings and presentation boards were both labeled and filed by job number. In processing the collection, the decision was made to organize and file both the client files and the architectural drawings by job number, in order to reflect the chronological order in which they were created. Thus, the current schema organizes all materials for a given job (the client file, drawings, presentation boards, slides, etc.) under that job number. However, while all of the materials are grouped together intellectually, the large format drawings, presentation boards, and slides are housed separately from the client and graphics files.</p>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Robert C. Metcalf was born November 7, 1923, in Nashville, Ohio. In 1940, Metcalf applied to the University of Michigan's Department of Architecture, writing in his application, "I would like to make a name for myself in architecture; rather, I am going to do that."[1] Metcalf entered the University of Michigan in the fall of 1941. However, on December 8th, the day after the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor, Metcalf and his friends took the bus to Detroit to enlist in the Marine Corps. Despite his eagerness to enlist, Metcalf was turned away from the Marines due to a punctured ear drum and flat feet. Returning to the university, Metcalf continued his studies until March 15, 1943 when he was inducted into the United States Army, where he was assigned to a self-propelled artillery unit for basic training. Metcalf completed his training on Memorial Day 1943, graduating with the rank of Sergeant, and four days later on May 28th married Bettie Jane Sponseller, a registered nurse from Canton, Ohio.</p>
      <p>In August 1943, Metcalf was assigned to the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), a unit designed to provide the Army with highly trained technicians and specialists. Metcalf was sent to Johns Hopkins University for an intensive civil engineering program in which students completed the regular one year course of study in six months. In February 1944, the Army terminated ASTP and transferred its students to combat units. Metcalf joined the 84th Infantry Division and in September 1944 was sent to Europe. He served forty-two month in the Army with the 84th Infantry and was awarded the Silver Star medal and a field commission as a Lieutenant. After his discharge from the service in 1946, Metcalf returned to his studies at the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>While enrolled in the Department of Architecture, Metcalf began an apprenticeship with professor George B. Brigham, a practicing Ann Arbor architect. Metcalf was Brigham's chief draftsman on approximately thirty residential projects in the Ann Arbor vicinity, and worked for Brigham from 1948 to1952. Upon completion of his studies (B.Arch., 1950), Metcalf and his wife decided to remain in Ann Arbor. Demand for post-war housing was strong and Ann Arbor "seemed the best place to begin a practice based on contemporary house design."[2] To put down their roots, the Metcalfs found an available lot on the east side of Ann Arbor and decided to design and build their own home. Metcalf's rationale was that "with luck, the construction would attract a client, but in the worst case, we assumed we could sell the house to recover costs and then build another."[3] The design of the house took one year and the construction approximately thirteen months. Robert and Bettie each worked on varying aspects of the construction after leaving their regular day jobs, having picnic dinners on-site every night for almost two years. The Metcalf home was featured in the <title render="italic">Michigan Alumnus</title> (1961) and <title render="italic">Better Homes and Gardens</title> (1965). In 2008, the Metcalfs received a Historic Preservation award from the City of Ann Arbor for their home.</p>
      <p>Metcalf's completion of his home coincided with the launching of a successful private practice. Bettie Metcalf retired from nursing in the same year to become the secretary and bookkeeper for Metcalf's new architectural firm. From 1953 to 2008, Metcalf's office completed over 150 projects in Michigan and Ohio. George Brigham's influence on the young architect was evident in Metcalf's modernist residences and commercial works. Metcalf's designs were also shaped by his esteem for architects Charles Sumner Greene, Henry Mather Greene, Bernard Maybeck, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Harwell Hamilton Harris.[4] Metcalf's work is notable for his emphasis on design analysis, a strength well reflected in his architectural drawings and sketches. As fellow architect and urban planer Gerald Crane observed, "Metcalf is the real thing. His work is totally honest and his construction drawings are absolutely meticulous."[5] Metcalf's houses reflect his beliefs in the importance of incorporating light, airiness, and nature into a home with the goal of creating "a serenity about a house."[6]</p>
      <p>Metcalf designed houses and businesses for many of Detroit and Ann Arbor's most prominent citizens. Among the University of Michigan faculty and administration for whom Metcalf designed homes were physicist H. Richard Crane (1953), College of Architecture professor Catherine B. Heller (1953), chemistry professor Philip J. Elving (1954), physicist David M. Dennison (1954), anthropology professor Elman R. Service (1954), physics professors Lawrence W. Jones (1955) and Kent M. Terwilliger (1955), industrial management professor Franklin G. Moore (1955), internal medicine professor and Chief of the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism Stefan S. Fajans (1957), professor of political science Everett S. Brown (1958), professor of surgery Dr. Reed O. Dingman (1959), engineering professor John Holland (1964) and professor of chemistry Lawrence S. Bartell (1988). In addition, Metcalf designed houses for Mr. Millard H. Pryor, Chairman of the Board of the Mollard-Barnes Manufacturing Company (1958), President of the Ford Motor Company Mr. Arjay Miller (1965), and Mr. George Huebner, a former Chrysler Director of Research, and his wife Trudy Huebner, a former University of Michigan Regent (1975).</p>
      <p>Over the course of his career, Metcalf worked with other architects including Tivadar Balogh and William Werner. Tivadar Balogh, a fellow UM alumnus (class of 1952) and later instructor in Michigan's College of Architecture and Urban Planning, joined Metcalf's firm in 1954, working as one of his draftsmen until 1960, when he left to work as an architect and designer for the firms of Shreve, Walker, and Associates and W.B. Ford Design Associates, both of Detroit. Metcalf had a longstanding relationship with architect William Werner. Werner, some of whose work appears in this collection, joined Metcalf in professional practice in 1955. He received his bachelor's and master's of architecture from Michigan (class of '52 and '57, respectively), and taught structure courses in the College of Architecture and Urban Planning, beginning as an instructor in 1956 and retiring as a full Professor in 1998.</p>
      <p>Among the many honors Metcalf has received for architecture are Honorable Mention in the Morton Arboretum Small House Competition (1954), an Honors Award from the Detroit Chapter of the American Institute of Architects for his own home (1955), an Award Citation from <title render="italic">Progressive Architecture</title> for designing the home of UM Professor David M. Dennison (1955), Honorable Mention with Tivadar Balogh in the Porcelain Enamel Design Competition for a youth center (1956), Third Award by the National Conference on Church Architecture for his work on the Church of the Good Shepherd (1958), the Homes for Better Living Honorable Mention from the American Institute of Architects, <title render="italic">House &amp; Home</title> and <title render="italic">Life</title> magazines (1958), membership in the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects, and the President's Award for lifetime achievement from the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Michigan (1999). Metcalf also served as past president of the Huron Valley Chapter of the AIA.</p>
      <p>Metcalf's work has been featured in numerous architectural journals including <title render="italic">Progressive Architecture</title> (January 1955), the <title render="italic">Michigan Society of Architects' Monthly Bulletin</title> (October 1955), <title render="italic">Architectural Forum</title> (March 1956), and the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Urban Planning's <title render="italic">Portico</title> (1991). Metcalf has also received mention in other non-industry publications such as <title render="italic">House and Home</title> (1958), <title render="italic">Ann Arbor Observer</title> (1977), <title render="italic">Ann Arbor Women's City Club Magazine</title> (1982), <title render="italic">Detroit Home</title> (2004), <title render="italic">Our House</title> (2007), and <title render="italic">Unwind Ann Arbor Business Review</title> (2007). Stories on Metcalf and his work have also appeared repeatedly over the years in <title render="italic">The Ann Arbor News</title>, the <title render="italic">Detroit Free Press</title> and the <title render="italic">Detroit Free Press Roto Magazine</title>, the <title render="italic">Michigan Alumnus</title>, the <title render="italic">Michigan Daily</title>, Lansing's <title render="italic">State Journal</title>, and <title render="italic">The Canton Repository</title>.</p>
      <p>In addition to Metcalf's private architectural practice, he had a long teaching and administrative career in the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Design. He joined the Department of Architecture as a part-time visiting lecturer in 1950 and was later promoted to Assistant Professor (1958), Associate Professor (1963), and Professor (1968). In 1968, Metcalf was also appointed Chairman of the Department of Architecture. In 1974, the same year in which Department became the College of Architecture, Metcalf was awarded the University of Michigan's Sol King Award for Excellence in Teaching in Architecture. Metcalf served as the first Dean of the College, a position he held from 1974 until 1986. Metcalf stepped down from the Dean position in 1986 to begin phased retirement from the College. In 1989, the University of Michigan Board of Regents named Metcalf the Emil Lorch Professor of Architecture and Urban Planning. Metcalf retired from the university with emeritus status in 1991. Bettie J. Metcalf passed away in February 2008.</p>

      <p>The Robert C. Metcalf papers include architectural drawings, presentation boards, client files, photographs, slides, and negatives of Metcalf's work on residential, commercial, and community projects. The collection provides comprehensive documentation on virtually all of the projects undertaken by Metcalf. Projects are documented from design to construction and often subsequent additions and renovations. The materials in the collection are organized into three series: Project Files, General Files, and Audio Visual Materials.</p>

          <p>The Project Files series, 1950-2008, (10.5 linear feet and 4,372 drawings) comprises the core of the collection and consists of textual and visual materials related to Metcalf's architectural projects, including new buildings, renovations, and additions. The series is divided into two subseries: Projects by Job Number and Projects without Job Numbers.</p>
          <p>The Projects by Job Number subseries is organized chronologically by project number and year, and includes the client name and address of the building project. The material within this subseries typically include architectural drawings, as well as a client file containing client correspondence, design development materials, client specifications, and billing information. Metcalf's careful attention to detail is reflected superbly in the drawings in this collection. The description of the architectural drawings includes measurements for the individual drawings, medium (such as pencil on vellum or blueline print) and type of drawing (elevation, section, detail, etc.). Many of the client files also include real estate listings for the house that give a sense of its market valuation over time, as well as information on original and subsequent owners. In addition to the client file and architectural drawings, many projects also include graphic materials, photographs, slides, and presentation boards.</p>
          <p>Among the project files in this series are documents relating to the building, construction, and renovation of Robert and Bettie Metcalf's home in Ann Arbor. Of special note are two personal journals of "work done" that record the daily activities necessary to build the Metcalf house ca. 1952-1953. Hours were tallied for both Robert and Bettie and show the determination that they both had in building their own house. The journals reflect Robert's construction learning experience and are in his hand.</p>
          <p>The majority of Metcalf's project files consist of those with job numbers assigned by the architect. Metcalf labeled the client files, architectural drawings, presentation boards, and other materials with the job number. The job number reflects the project's sequence in the work done by Metcalf and his firm, combined with the year in which the project was contracted. For instance, job 2-54 is the second job of Metcalf's professional practice and was commissioned in 1954. In addition to job numbers, Metcalf also referred to projects by the client's surname. Although the majority of Metcalf's projects are organized by job number, there is also an index of jobs by surname following the Processing Note in this finding aid.</p>
          <p>The Projects without Job Numbers subseries is organized alphabetically by client last name. The files within this series consist of information on clients, but do not include architectural drawings or other project-related materials.</p>
