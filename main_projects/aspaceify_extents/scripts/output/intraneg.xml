      <p>The Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) was founded in 1930. According to the constitution, its goals were "the advancement of the art and science of transportation engineering, the fostering of transportation education, the stimulation of original research in transportation engineering, the professional improvement of its members, the encouragement of intercourse between person with mutual interest in transportation engineering, and establishment of a central point of reference and union for its members." In 1976 after four years of consideration, the Institute changed its name from "Traffic" to "Transportation" engineers in order to increase the scope of its activity and to insure participation of individuals concerned in any way with the movement of goods and people. Specifically, this broadened scope of activity reflected a growing awareness of, and interest in, the variety of mass transportation methods and facilities.</p>
      <p>Locally, the Institute functions through sections (chapters), representing individual states, regions, or nations. The Michigan Section of the ITE was unofficially organized on January 28, 1944. In March of 1946 the section was officially recognized and chartered by the international organization. The section had sixty-eight members in 1972 (the fourth largest membership behind New York, Illinois, and California).</p>
      <p>The Michigan Section was the first to hold technical conferences (1967), and the first to establish a Technical Projects Committee. In 1981 the section had eight committees, two involving technical interest. The technical committees and conferences are among the most regularly held and attended in the section.</p>
      <p>In addition to an annual meeting, the Michigan Section has monthly meetings held in various locations around the state. These meetings are the most popular, combining social and business activities, and providing the broadest opportunity for participation in the affairs of the Institute.</p>
      <p>The Michigan, Indiana and Ohio sections together form District III of the Institute. The District also holds an annual meeting as well as an occasional conference. By agreement the leadership of the District passes on a rotation basis among the three sections.</p>

      <p>The records of the Michigan Section of the Institute of Transportation Engineers date from 1946 to the present. The record group has been divided into the following series: Early organizational records, 1944-1976; Officers' Record Books; and Topical Files.</p>

          <p>The Early organizational records spans three separate time periods: 1946-1948, 1956-1964, and 1966-1978, and has been organized into six subseries: Organizational Documents, Administrative files, Membership Activities, Correspondence, District III files, and Miscellaneous. This series documents the Institute's basic concern with highway safety and related issues, specifically the question of uniform traffic signal devices, highway use taxes, safety regulations, traffic movement, and mass transportation methods and facilities. Documentation of these concerns is strongest for the years since 1966. Unfortunately, for the years before, there is sketchy information and almost nothing at all about the process by which ITE formulated its policy decisions.</p>

            <p>"Organizational Documents, 1946-1976" (1 folder) includes a representative sample of international, district, and section constitutions, bylaws, and charters. District and section lists and maps are also included. The original 1946 constitution of the Michigan Section and later revisions are among the most important items. A copy of a 1981 "officer guidelines" (manual) and charters for student chapters on the campuses of Michigan State University and the University of Michigan are also included. The documents are arranged chronologically within the three levels of organizational hierarchy, starting with the national level.</p>

            <p>"Administrative files, 1946-1976" (6 folders) includes policies, annual reports, minutes of the executive board and board of directors; secretary and treasurer reports, annual lists of officers and committee members and membership rosters. Several unincorporated association bank account papers are also included. The executive board's annual reports, the treasurer's reports and the membership and officers lists form the complete portion of other administrative files. In contrast, the executive board minutes cover only 1970 to 1973 and 1976, the board of directors minutes are for 1973 only, and the secretary's reports are very spotty after the 1950s. However, this can be partially remedied by reviewing the annual secretary's report in the <title render="italic">Michiganite</title> newsletter after 1966. Materials are arranged chronologically within each folder.</p>

            <p>"Membership Activities, 1946-1978" (7 folders) includes minutes, reports, resolutions, project activity, schedules and notices of regular and special meetings and committees. The collection of meeting notices is only complete for the years 1946, 1947, 1958, 1971, 1972 and 1974. The minutes of monthly meetings are also incomplete; only the periods, 1946-1948 and 1957-1964 are well represented. Both groups can be supplemented by referring to the <title render="italic">Michiganite</title>. The Uniform Traffic Control Devices Committee folder consists of drafts and a final copy of a manual prepared between 1968 and 1971. The minutes of special meetings include the constitutional convention of 1971 and the "unofficial" organizing meeting in 1944. "Committee Reports" is the most incomplete file with only the years 1950, 1962, 1967 and 1971-1972 partially represented. Some reports are printed regularly in the <title render="italic">Michiganite</title>. This series also includes a folder of resolutions. The resolutions cover the period of 1944 to 1972 with the bulk spanning the years 1966 to 1969. The resolutions cover a broad range of topics, from calls for federal highway studies, prohibition of tire studs in Michigan, to the expression of sympathy to families of deceased section members. The majority of the resolutions, however, concern legislation at levels of government for traffic safety programs and regulations.</p>
