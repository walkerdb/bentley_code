    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Stella Brunt Osborn was born on July 31, 1894 in Hamilton, Canada. She finished elementary school in 1908, and subsequently went to work at the age of fifteen as a stenographer. She eventually completed her high school education through night classes in Toledo, Ohio. In 1916 she entered the University of Michigan, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1922. In 1930 she received a master's degree in Medieval English Literature, and in 1978, an honorary Doctorate of Letters, both from the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>In the years 1923 to 1930 she worked as an editor for various publications. In 1931, she became the adopted daughter of Chase S. Osborn, ex-Governor of Michigan, and collaborated with him on five books: <title render="italic">The Conquest of a Continent</title>, 1939; <title render="italic">Schoolcraft-Longfellow-Hiawatha</title>, 1942; <title render="italic">Hiawatha with its Original Indian Legends</title>, 1944; <title render="italic">Errors in the U.S. Official Area Figures</title>, 1945; and <title render="italic">Northwood Sketches</title>, 1949. On her own Stella Osborn wrote <title render="italic">Eighty and on</title>, 1941; <title render="italic">A tale of Possum Poke in Possum Lane</title>, 1946; <title render="italic">Balsam Boughs</title>, 1949; <title render="italic">Jasmine Springs</title>, 1953; <title render="italic">Polly Cadotte</title>, 1955; <title render="italic">Beside the cabin</title>, 1957; <title render="italic">Iron and Arbutus</title>, 1962; and <title render="italic">Summer Songs on the St. Mary's</title>, 1982. On April 9, 1949 her adoption was annulled and she then married Chase Osborn.</p>
      <p>Since Chase Osborn's death (April 11, 1949), Stella Osborn's main interest has been in a number of international world peace organizations for which she has worked as a volunteer for nearly thirty years. These include the Atlantic Union Committee (founder and chairman, Michigan branch), the International Movement for Atlantic Union (founder of the North American branch; secretary 1958-1965), Federal Union, Inc. (board member, 1962), International Association for Federal Union (founder, honorary vice-president, 1972). She was also active in the Capitol Club of the Business and Professional Women's Club, and was a Distinguished Professor of Humanities at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tipton, Georgia. She retired in 1972, but maintained an active interest and correspondence with these organization.</p>
      <p>Stella Osborn died in Sault St. Marie in March 1988, where she had moved from Poulan, Georgia in 1980. In the last years of her life, she continued a lively interest in world affairs, actively corresponding with friends and with colleagues from the various peace organizations with which she had been involved.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Stella Osborn collection was received in multiple accessions. The bulk of the papers were received from her home in Georgia (1958) and her office in Washington D.C. (1972). These materials documenting her entire career were organized into seven series: Biographical; Correspondence; Personal and miscellaneous; Atlantic Union Committee and related; Business and Professional Women's Club; Sound recordings; and Index card files. An extremely active woman with many interests and causes, Stella Osborn continued to add to her papers with a later accession in 1983. Following her death, the executor of her estate and other friends added to the collection with materials which she had retained for whatever reason or which had been in storage. There is obviously some overlap in these later materials and the files received previously. The purpose of the Summary Contents List (see below) is to draw like materials together.</p>
      <p>The 1992 accession was more fully described than the earlier papers. This accession includes biographical notes and clippings about Stella Osborn and Chase Osborn. There is, in addition, personal and organizational correspondence, financial and estate records (1970-1988), land deeds for the Osborn holdings in Georgia and Michigan, organizational material for the Federal Union and the Atlantic Union Committee, manuscripts of poetry, prose, and political essays (including some material by Chase Osborn), and Stella Osborn's diaries (1982-87). The collection includes childhood photographs of Stella Osborn and photographs of her parents and grandparents. Two copies of a videotape about the Osborn farm in Georgia, Possum Poke, are included here as well.</p>
      <p>Much of this accession documents the last few years of Stella Osborn's life, after her move to a retirement home in Sault St. Marie Michigan, years during which she maintained an interest in people and world peace organizations, and in documenting her own and Chase Osborn's place in history. While the bulk of correspondence here is for 1982, 1983, and 1987, some earlier correspondence is included as well. Of interest to university historians is the topical correspondence file on Robert Frost's visit to Michigan. Stella Osborn's lifelong friendship with Yuki Otsuki is documented by their extensive correspondence, a series of letters beautifully written and presented that recall earlier days, including student life.</p>
      <p>The collection contains some material of interest to researchers interested in Chase Osborn, including the series of land transfers and deeds which document Chase and Stella Osborn's extensive holdings in Georgia and Michigan, and their gifts of land to various charities and institutions. Also included is some Chase Osborn correspondence and copies of articles he wrote about his extensive travels in Africa. Chase Osborn's 1938 "Longfellow Birthday Book" contains the birth dates of his ancestors. Several letters from 1936 pertain to Chase Osborn's involvement in the movement to build the Mackinac Bridge.</p>
      <p>Of special interest to researchers interested in Stella Osborn and her role in various world peace organizations are her unpublished autobiographical manuscripts and files. Also of interest are her diaries, where she continued to record her ideas about politics and her memories.</p>

          <p>The Chase Osborn series is comprised of non-financial documents originated by Chase Osborn, including a carbon prose travel narrative titled, "Following the Ancient Gold Trail of Hiram of Tyre and Solomon," newsprint copies of several articles on his African travels, and his series of letters, "Africa as it is Today." There are also several letters from Stella Osborn that refer to this last manuscript. Of interest are the bedside charts of Chase Osborn during his last illness in 1949 and one folder of correspondence (1936) concerning the building of the Mackinac Bridge.</p>
