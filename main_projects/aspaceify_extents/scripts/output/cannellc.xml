      <abstract>Charles Cannell was a social scientist, professor, and co-founder of the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan. Papers consist of project files, research proposals and grant applications, conference presentations, teaching material, and biographical information, the majority of which span 1974 to 1998. The bulk of the collection represents work on an array of projects regarding interviewing and survey methodology, including several projects on the use of technology, such as the telephone, in the interviewing process.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Charles Frederick Cannell was born on September 10, 1913 in Antrim, New Hampshire. He received his B.A. from the University of New Hampshire in 1936 and began his doctoral studies in clinical psychology two years later at the Ohio State University. After the United States entered World War II, Cannell interrupted his doctoral studies and moved to Washington D.C., where he began work at the Division of Program Studies in the Department of Agriculture. By the end of his time at the department, Cannell had risen to the position of field staff director for the Program Studies Division, which had developed into a general survey facility for the government.</p>
      <p>In 1946 Cannell moved to Ann Arbor and joined the faculty of the University of Michigan. Along with Rensis Likert and Angus Campbell, Cannell was among the first generation of researchers who founded the Survey Research Center (SRC), a division of the university's Institute for Social Research. Cannell helped to establish the SRC as one of the first national interviewing facilities in the United States. Cannell also restarted his dissertation, receiving his doctoral degree from Ohio State in 1952.</p>
      <p>Cannell was most known for his work in methodological research. While at the University of Michigan, his research focused on understanding the psychology of the survey process, the reliability of survey data, and variables acting on interviewers and respondents. Along with many articles and chapters he produced throughout his career, he co-authored the classic 1957 book <title render="italic">The Dynamics of Interviewing</title>, with Robert Kahn. Cannell was a fellow of the American Statistical Association and the American Psychological Association. He was a Fulbright Senior Scholar in 1981, and in 1999 received the Award for Exceptionally Distinguished Achievement from the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). The university and the Survey Research Center honors his memory with the Charles Cannell Fund in Survey Methodology, with the goal to "further research and training on the interviewer-respondent interaction and its effects on the validity and quality of survey data."</p>

      <p>The Charles F. Cannell Papers measure 2.5 linear feet and range from 1946 to 2001. The bulk of the material, however, dates from 1974 to 1998. Papers consist of project files, research proposals and grant applications, conference presentations, teaching material, and biographical information, the majority of which span 1974 to 1998. The bulk of the collection represents work on an array of projects regarding interviewing and survey methodology, including several projects on the use of technology, such as the telephone, in the interviewing process. The papers have been divided into four series: Biographical Files; Conferences and Seminars Files; Projects and Proposals Files; and Topical Files.</p>

          <p>The Projects and Proposals Files, 1946-1947, 1970-1989 (1.5 linear feet) are organized around 21 research projects and grant proposals. The topics include public opinion surveys Cannell conducted while at the Department of Agriculture's Division of Program Studies. Two of these projects focus on public opinion concerning the atom bomb after the tests on Bikini Island and the public view of the international situation after World War II. These papers include survey material with original interviews, interviewer correspondence, and opinion summaries that help capture the public mood of the late 1940s. The majority of the Projects and Proposals series consists of research conducted while Cannell was on the faculty at the University of Michigan. This material relates to interviewing methodology, survey physiology and technology. Several of these projects focus on telephone surveys and how telephone technology affected the quality of the interview process. Research in this area include the relationship between voice quality and survey refusal rates, several projects on health surveys conducted over the telephone, methods for studying and improving telephone interviewing techniques, and research into computer assisted telephone interviewing. The University of Michigan projects also contain material on housing surveys, the accuracy of automobile accident reporting, and many funding proposals, the bulk of which are requests to the National Science Foundation.</p>
