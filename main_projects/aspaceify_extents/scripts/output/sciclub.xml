      <p>The Science Research Club of the University of Michigan was formed on October 20, 1902 by roughly thirty graduate students in the Pathological Laboratory. The initial name was the Michigan Laboratory Club, but this was quickly changed to the Junior Research Club. This name remained unchanged until 1945 when it adopted its current name, the Science Research Club. The club's first president, Louis M. Gelston, was also one of its founders. The club has had some stellar members including Jonas E. Salk of Polio vaccine fame and Donald A. Glaser, who was awarded a Nobel prize for his work in physics.</p>
      <p>The club's purpose was clearly established in the original constitution: "The purpose of this organization shall be to establish and maintain an association which shall permit persons active in pure or applied scientific investigation to obtain the stimulus of mutual contact and the benefits of interchange of ideas."</p>
      <p>Activities take place during the academic year. The meetings commence on the first Tuesday of the month, and generally consist of two scientific presentations followed by brief discussions. The last meeting of the year is a banquet where officers are introduced for the following year. It had been the tradition of the club to meet in the Rackham Amphitheater. This tradition changed on November 3, 1970 when the organization decided to move its meetings to the Chrysler Center Auditorium.</p>
      <p>In January 1969 the club discussed the possibility of admitting women to membership. In a close vote the motion was rejected. In January 1972 another motion to allow women to become members was offered and adopted by the members. As a consequence of this vote the constitution of the club was changed in March 1972 to reflect a non-biased membership policy. The club was dissolved in 2004 due to a lack of active members and volunteers for officer positions.</p>

      <p>The records of the Science Research Club measure 3.75 linear feet. The dates of coverage stretch from 1902 to 2004, with the bulk dates covering the years from 1940 to 1988. The records have been divided into six series: Background and Organization; Record Books; Financial Records; Officers and Committees; Programs; and Membership.</p>

          <p>The Background and Organization series contains a concise history by A.D. Moore (up to 1980), along with a host of club memorabilia including such things as a list of past officers, pamphlets, clippings, and obituaries of former members. Club statistics are also included, the majority of which are on the early years of the club. Statistics document such membership categories as new members, percentage of new members, membership withdrawn, withdrawal percentages, and dues paying members. This series also series deals with the club's constitutions and amendments and contains various copies of the club's constitution as it was changed and amended over the years. Background and Organization also contains a file on the final meeting of the club in 2004 and a scattering of administrative materials (1985-2003), which includes agendas, meeting minutes, and room reservations for events.</p>

          <p>The Record Books series documents the activities of the club in segments. The first book covers the time period 1902-1914. Included with the general information (banquet programs, financial reports, membership lists, minutes of meetings) are pertinent writings that elucidate the early history (1902-1906) of the club, e.g, the first constitution (1902). The second record book (1914-1932) primarily covers conventional club information. The third book documents club activities the time period 1932-1941. In this era the club considered some policy changes dealing with new members. The fourth book covers the years from 1941 to 1945. The fifth (1958-1980) book chronicles two major changes in the club including a new meeting place (Chrysler Center 1970) and the acceptance of female members (1972).</p>
