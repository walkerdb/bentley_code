      <p>Nicholas H. Steneck joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1970. Originally from the East Coast, he earned his B.S. at Rutgers University in 1962. He then attended the University of Wisconsin for graduate school. There he received an M.A. in history and a Ph.D. in medieval history and the history of science in 1970. Steneck's wife, Margaret Steneck, also received her M.A. and Ph.D. in Tudor-Stuart history from the University of Wisconsin. She worked as a Lecturer in history at the University of Michigan, and the two team-taught History 265, a course they developed on the history of the University Michigan.</p>
      <p>As an historian of science, Steneck displayed both a strong humanities-based perspective and a strong interest in science and related ethical issues. In 1983 he proposed a Science-Humanities Center, to be housed in the historic Detroit Observatory, that would "coordinate activities that fall between the sciences and the humanities" (letter to Steiner, 1983). The melding of these two interests and perspectives helps explain many of the programs and projects Steneck worked on during his career. After serving as an active member and as an Associate Director, Steneck was named Director of the Collegiate Institute for Values and Science (CIVS) in 1982, a post he held until 1990, when he ended his directorship to focus on the University of Michigan Historical Center for the Health Sciences (HCHS). In 1990, Steneck created and became Director of HCHS, through which he hoped to preserve the history of the important role of the University's health sciences programs in promoting human health. He held this post until 1996 when Howard Markel took over as Director. (Markel later recast HCHS as the Center for the History of Medicine.) Steneck served for many years as LS&amp;A Co-Director of the Integrated Premedical-Medical Program (Inteflex), which sought to provide a more solid humanities component to premedical education while transitioning Inteflex students more quickly from undergraduate into medical school. He also served during the mid-1980s on the LSA/Medical School Task Force and the LSA/Medical School Liaison Committee, helping to evaluate and adjust the Inteflex program. Beginning in 1987, he worked to organize a Michigan chapter and Michigan conferences for Science Technology and Society (STS).</p>
      <p>As his involvement in programs like CIVS and STS indicate, Steneck had an interest in ethics and values in scientific research. This is also evident in some of the committees and task forces he either served on or chaired, including the Integrity of Scholarship Task Force (ISTF) from 1982-1984, The Academic Freedom and Academic Responsibility (AFAR) Committee from 1984-1986, the Committee on the Use and Care of Animals in 1987, the Conference on Teaching Ethics and Values (CTEV) Committee from 1987-1989, the Public Health Service Advisory Committee on Research Integrity from 1991-1993, and the Panel of Inquiry into Federally-sponsored Human Radiation Research at the U of M in the Post-WWII Era from 1994-1995.</p>
      <p>Steneck joined the College of Engineering faculty in 1996 as Adjunct Professor of Ethics in Industrial and Operations Engineering with primary responsibility for implementing the ethics thread of Curriculum 2000. After retirement, Steneck continued as Emeritus Professor of History in LS&amp;A and remained active on the topic of integrity in scientific research as a consultant to the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) and in other forums.</p>
      <p>Steneck's publications include <title render="italic">Science and Creation in the Middle Ages</title> (1976), <title render="italic">The Microwave Debate</title> (1984), the <title render="italic">ORI Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research</title> (2004), and articles on the history of research misconduct policy, animal use in research, classified research and academic freedom, faculty governance, and the role of values in university research.</p>

          <p>The Programs and Projects (1 linear foot, 1976-1998) series contains correspondence, meeting agendas and minutes, program and funding proposals, handwritten notes, background and other working materials, and reports related to programs and projects Nick Steneck started or was closely involved with during his career. The first of these is the Collegiate Institute for Values and Science (CIVS). CIVS began as an evening seminar series in 1976 and was expanded into a Collegiate Institute in Winter 1977 as a forum for exploring practical and philosophical questions related to scientific research and human values. Steneck's papers contain a CIVS annual report that Steneck authored, correspondence, notes and papers on CIVS programs, documents related to the initial search for CIVS Fellows, and other documents from the beginning of CIVS. Papers on the Historical Center for the Health Sciences (HCHS) contain correspondence, meeting minutes, a prospectus and a 6 month progress report, both authored by Steneck, and folders relating to projects either undertaken by HCHS or projects that pre-dated HCHS but were directly related to HCHS interests. These include the Historic Instruments and Observatory Preservation (HIOP) Committee, surveys of historic art related to the hospital and medical school, Old Main Hospital preservation, Detroit Observatory preservation, the Kellogg Project on the history of African American health care, and a CD-ROM on the history of instruments of gastrointestinal endoscopy. Steneck was also involved with the Integrated Premedical-Medical Program, or Inteflex, both on committees and as LS&amp;A Co-Director. His papers related to this program include reports, correspondence, budget information, and curriculum discussions. They also contain agendas, minutes, and correspondence on the related LSA/Medical School Liaison Committee and the LSA/Medical School Task Force. In the mid to late-1980s, Steneck made an effort to begin a Michigan chapter of Science Technology and Society (STS), and his papers contain correspondence, notes, questionnaires, conference participant lists, and meeting minutes on this topic.</p>

          <p>The Committees and Task Forces (1.5 linear feet, 1987-1998) series consists of meeting agendas and minutes, correspondence, background and other working materials, and final reports relating to various committees and task forces Steneck either served on or chaired during his career. Perhaps the most significant records in this series are those relating to the Integrity of Scholarship Task Force (ISTF), which Steneck chaired. This was the first such task force and was met with much interest from both within and outside the University of Michigan. Two folders of material relating to requests from outside the university for copies of the ISTF Final report attest to this interest. The ISTF material also includes information on the nomination process for the task force, correspondence, handwritten notes, research into related policies, questionnaires, report drafts, and the final report. Steneck led the Academic Freedom and Academic Responsibility (AFAR) Committee, which is represented in this series with memos and correspondence, letters seeking funding, and papers and a final report authored by Steneck. The series also includes materials on the Committee on the Use and Care of Animals, formed to address the 6-month probationary status given to the University of Michigan Animal Research Facility by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care; the Human Radiation Committee, or Panel of Inquiry into Federally-sponsored Human Radiation Research at the University of Michigan in the Post-World War II Era; the Conference on Teaching Ethics and Values (CTEV) Committee; History Department Curriculum Committee; the Research Policies Committee; the Humanities Advisory Committee; History of Medicine Professor Search; and Steneck's involvement in the inauguration ceremonies of university presidents James J. Duderstadt and Lee C. Bollinger.</p>

Several courses--UC 211, UC 342, UC 265, and UC 615--addressed research ethics and science and values, which fits with Steneck's other professional interests and activities. The Courses sub-series also contains correspondence and course material for several overseas summer programs Steneck participated in.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The History of the University of Michigan subseries contains a self-guided tour of Central Campus authored by Nick and Margaret Steneck, who developed and team-taught a course on the history of the University. The rest of this sub-series consists of student papers for major assignments in the course. These include an oral history assignment and a major research paper. For the oral history assignment, students interviewed alumni or employees of the University with knowledge of some aspect or period of the University's history. These folders contain papers written from these interviews as well as interview transcripts and, in some cases, audio tape recordings of the interviews. The course research papers are arranged by topics such as Buildings, Athletics, or Greek System. As undergraduate assignments, these are not necessarily authoritative sources, but in many cases they contain first-person accounts of student life as well as university history on focused topics, often informed by primary sources, which likely have not been written on elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The Slides (2 linear feet) series consists of slides that Steneck compiled or created, primarily about the history of the University of Michigan and the city of Ann Arbor. The slides contain pictures used in his UM practicum course. Slides also include material from the medical facilities, the engineering department, and the Detroit Observatory. Titles listed are the labels written on each individual slide box, which then contain a number of slides organized by categories. There are 13 slide boxes total.</p>

        <p>Additional materials on many of the projects and organizations represented in the Steneck papers can be found in other Bentley Library records. The library holds collections for the Collegiate Institute for Values and Science (CIVS), the Historical Center for the Health Sciences (HCHS, known subsequently as the Center for the History of Medicine), the Integrated Premedical-Medical Program (Inteflex), and the Detroit Observatory. The CIVS collection has folders related to the Academic Freedom and Academic Responsibility (AFAR) committee. The CIVS collection and the School of Public Policy collection both have some material on the Ann Arbor chapter of International Student Pugwash (ISP).</p>
        <p>Steneck deposited research materials for his 1984 book <title render="italic">The Microwave Debate</title>, at the Gerald R. Ford Library. This includes "published material related to the biological effects of microwave radiation and government documents, acquired under the Freedom of Information Act, related to the microwave bombardment of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow" (Ford Library finding aid).</p>
