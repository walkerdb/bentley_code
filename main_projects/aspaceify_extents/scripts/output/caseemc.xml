      <abstract>Ermine Cowles Case was a prolific paleontologist and geologist, and a well respected professor of historical geology and paleontology at the University of Michigan. He was instrumental in the discovery and naming of several dinosaurs, and did considerable research on prehistoric vertebrates. The collection includes professional and person files that contain correspondence, organizational activities, recognitions, research, speeches, biographical records, and photographs. Inclusive dates span from 1805-1956, but most fall in the 1902s-1940s.</abstract>

      <p>Ermine Cowles Case (1871-1955) was a prominent American paleontologist, internationally known as one of the world's leading authorities on prehistoric life. He taught at University of Michigan from 1907-1941, and was a professor of geology and paleontology. In addition to teaching, Case was the Chairman of the Department of Paleontology and Curator of Vertebrates. He was also the Director of the Museum of Geology, and when it changed in 1928 to the Museum of Paleontology, Case became its first Director.</p>
      <p>Case researched the scientific naming of dinosaurs and dedicated his life to filling in the fossil record of Permian and Carboniferous vertebrates from the 'red beds' of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. He also did research on stratigraphy and hominid evolution. His vast research produced several articles, monographs, and books. Because of his work, many dinosaurs were either named by him or after him.</p>
      <p>Case was very active with paleontology and geology fieldwork. He made many discoveries, including the Brier Creek Bone Bed in Archer County, Texas, where well over 1500 specimens of separate bones were found. He also led many field parties in the western and plains states developing museum fossil collections (particularly the Paleontology Museum at University of Michigan).</p>
      <p>In addition to traveling the United States, Case also traveled the world doing research and attending conferences, such as the International Geological Congress held in various capitols around the world. Some of his travels include locations like South America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Europe, and Central Asia. One of his excursions was met with the unfortunate passing of his wife, who accompanied him to Cape Town, South Africa in the early 1920s.</p>
      <p>Despite her death, Case continued to make significant contributions to the scientific community. He was involved in many local and national organizations, clubs, and societies. He held prominent positions, such as 1929 President of the Paleontological Society of America, and representative for the Division of Geology and Geography to the National Research Council. Some other organizations he was involved with included the National Research Council, the American Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists, and the American Philosophical Society. For his contributions to these organizations and the scientific community, Case received many recognitions, awards, and honors. There is now an Ermine Cowles Case Memorial Lecture award given annually.</p>

      <p>The records of Ermine Cowles Case span the course of his professional career, including his research, travels, and involvement in many scientific circles. Outside of academia, Case maintained correspondence with several family members and close friends, which this collection also contains. Aware of his contributions to history, Case filed away his many professional and personal correspondences noting in the first folder, "These letters are worth keeping and looking over. They contain much information of what went on, and many signatures of men active in Geology and Paleontology, both in U.S. and abroad, in my working time" (1947). Several small notes like these can be found throughout the collection among letters, photographs, and research materials. The series in this collection include: Professional Files, Personal Files, and Visual Materials.</p>

          <p>The Professional Files consist of five subseries. The first subseries, which makes up a majority of the series, contains letters between Case and his colleagues, students, and other noteworthy scholars, such as Barnum Brown, William H. Hobbs, Alfred S. Romer, and Friedrich Von Huene. Correspondence pertains to expeditions, stratigraphic localities, and fossil collecting, typing, and naming. The letters are arranged alphabetically. There are also correspondences from the various geological and paleontological societies and congresses in which he was involved. Case's involvement with one of the groups, The National Research Council, makes up the second subseries. The third subseries contains recognitions given to E.C. Case, such as newspaper clippings, honors, and records of the dinosaurs that were named by, or named after him. The fourth subseries contains some of Case's research and related work, including some documentation of his foreign travels, his research on stratigraphy, and a copy of his textbook manuscript. The final subseries is a collection of speeches and talks given by Case at various events. They are sorted by event or group name.</p>

          <p>The Personal Files are arranged into five subseries: biographical records, correspondence, journals and notebooks, planners, and ration books. The biographical records contain an autobiography of E.C. Case in addition to various biographical materials. The correspondences contain letters from his family, and documentation pertaining to his father and the passing of his wife. They also contain special letters from friends, and letters from Alexander Winchell to A. O. Carrier Esq. regarding specimen collection, geological surveys, and the geographical distribution of animals. The journals and notebooks consist of several volumes of travel narratives, research, notes, and sketches. The planners and point ration books are mostly from the 1940s.</p>
