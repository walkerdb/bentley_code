    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The University of Michigan was a pioneer in the development of guidance and counseling programs for its many foreign students. Instrumental in the early efforts of helping these students adjust to their new condition was J. Raleigh Nelson. In 1908, Nelson had come to the University of Michigan to head up a program of English language instruction for engineering students; in 1911, he was named Counselor to Foreign Students in the College of Engineering.</p>
      <p>For many years, the counseling of foreign students was largely limited to the College of Engineering. In 1933, President Ruthven, aware of the need in other schools, asked Nelson to serve as University Counselor to Foreign Students. In this broader role, Nelson looked about for a centralized meeting place where the university's foreign students could gather, discuss common problems, and enjoy each other's company. Space at the Michigan Union was suggested, and in August 1938, Nelson (now Director of the International Center) moved into his new quarters. Within this one office, Nelson consolidated the responsibilities relating to foreign students which had formerly been spread throughout the University: English instruction, liaison with the government over immigration and naturalization problems, and coordinating programs of social and intellectual enrichment.</p>
      <p>During his tenure, Nelson and the International Center promoted social contacts between American and foreign students on campus. The social, political, religious, and economic leaders of Ann Arbor were also encouraged to attend and support activities sponsored by the International Center. One of Professor Nelson's last acts before his retirement in 1943 was to recommend the establishment of the International Center's Board of Governors. This insured continuity with regard to the direction and goals of the Center.</p>
      <p>Dr. Esson M. Gale became director of the International Center in 1943. In 1927 he served as a visiting lecturer of Far Eastern history at the University of Michigan. He returned, in 1942, as James Orin Murfin Professor of Political Science. Gale brought to the Center a deep knowledge of the peoples and cultures of the Far East, having lived in China for over thirty years. During Gale's tenure the responsibilities of the director and the International Center increased to include the coordination of the growing international interests of the university. These included private and government sponsored foreign student exchange programs; the creation of government programs, e.g. the Advisory Board for Emergency Aid to Chinese Students; and the foreign visitors programs.</p>
      <p>Dr. James M. Davis succeeded Dr. Gale in 1954 as director of the International Center. He also held the position of assistant professor of education at the University of Michigan. Prior to coming to Michigan, Davis worked at the Institute of International Education in New York and from 1948 to 1954 was Counselor to Foreign Students and Executive Director of the Foundation for International Understanding Through Students at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>
      <p>In his ten years as director, Davis stressed the importance of counseling. The size of the staff increased allowing greater contact between individual students and staff members. Surveys and projects, e.g. the annual housing survey, gave the staff additional information to support their counseling. Davis also urged the foreign students to participate and accept greater responsibilities in campus activities. This was accomplished through the International Students Association. Under the direction of the International Center, the Association became the major voice representing foreign students on campus.</p>
      <p>Dr. Robert B. Klinger, a member of the International Center staff since 1938, became acting director of the Center in 1964 and director in 1966. Dr. Klinger continued the policies established by his predecessors; in addition, he developed programs aimed at strengthening the ties of the International Center to its foreign student alumni. Under his guidance, the International Center also offered greater services for those American students interested in studying and traveling abroad. Klinger left the International Center in 1971.</p>
      <p>Today the International Center continues to provide such services as non-academic counseling for foreign students, arranging programs for visiting foreign leaders, providing information on housing, health insurance, employment, and legal information, advising student groups, and representing the University of Michigan in the relationships with various governmental and private agencies.</p>

      <p>The collection is divided into six series. The first series, Historical Files, contains early filing methods of the Directors and a small amount of background on the Center. It also contains early papers from 1927-1930 on the Cosmopolitan Club and spring trips for foreign students. The second series, Director's Files, has been organized according to the filing systems employed by each of the Center's first four directors: J. Raleigh Nelson (1933-1943); Esson M. Gale (1943-1954); James M. Davis (1954-1964); and Robert B. Klinger (1964-1971). Files of each director comprise separate sub-series. Each of these four sub-series includes administrative records such as papers of the Board of Governors, minutes of committees connected to the International Center, and annual reports. Within each sub-series there are files of particular importance and interest. Photographs compose the third series, including one scrapbook of directors, students, and visitors to the International Center. Printed materials comprise the fourth series. The fifth series is made up of newspaper clippings. The sixth series consists of National Association of Foreign Student Advisers (Publications).</p>

            <p>The second sub-series (1943-1961) is the filing system established by Esson M. Gale and continued by James M. Davis. Under the directorship of Gale and Davis several important programs and national associations were established at the University of Michigan. The documents in this sub-series reflect the development of the University of Michigan's English Language Institute, the International Student Association, and the university's involvement in the Peace Corps. In addition, there are records concerning the Chinese Aid Program and the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers (NAFSA), an organization founded in Ann Arbor in 1948. The NAFSA records include administrative records from 1948 to 1958. These are the most complete set of records available for this time period as the records belonging to NAFSA were accidentally destroyed at their headquarters. The National Association of Foreign Student Advisers was renamed the National Association of Foreign Student Affairs in 1964, and again renamed NAFSA: Association of International Educators in 1990.</p>

            <p>The third sub-series contains documents from the second filing system used by James M. Davis. Davis, in 1962, modified the system established by Esson M. Gale and used this revised system through 1965. The documents in this group mirror Dr. Davis' and the International Center's work with private American agencies and bureaus, e.g. the Council on Student Travel and the National Council for Community Services to International Visitors (COSERV). In addition, the actions of the International Students Association are well documented here.</p>

          <p>The fourth series contains photographs, both in scrapbooks and individual folders. Photographs are categorized by groups, events, and people. Photographs from the most recent accession are found in both the scrapbook (mostly unidentified) and by loose groupings in folders. It is important to note that there is some crossover between photographs found in the scrapbook and those found in the folders.</p>

          <p>The Printed Materials series is divided into three sub-series. The first is unit publications that include annual reports, student directories, and manuals. There is a long run of newsletters, under varying titles, dating from 1939 to 1974. They describe in detail the activities of the International Center. The earliest issues also have small articles on alumni of the center. This sub-series also includes statistics on foreign students at the university, including numbers, gender, program of study, and country of origin. In some cases, there is also information regarding foreign faculty members. The second sub-series includes publications from the sub-units of the International Center. These include the Foreign Visitor Office, the Overseas Opportunities Office, and the Volunteers for International Hospitality. Student publications such as <title render="italic">The International Student</title>, and the <title render="italic">International Students Association Newsletter</title> comprise the third sub-series.</p>

          <p>The sixth and final series, National Association of Foreign Student Advisers (Publications), contains NAFSA newsletters published from 1962-2000. Although this collection is extensive it is not comprehensive. The series also includes issues of International Educators magazine from 1999-2000. The National Association of Foreign Student Advisers was renamed the National Association of Foreign Student Affairs in 1964, and again renamed NAFSA: Association of International Educators in 1990.</p>
