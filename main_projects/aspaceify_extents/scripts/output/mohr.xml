    <bioghist>
      <p>After a series of meetings of its Steering Committee in Detroit during the Summer of 1977,
        the Michigan Organization for Human Rights (M.O.H.R.) was founded officially at an
        organizing conference attended by approximately 50 people and held in Lansing, Michigan, on
        October 15 and 16, 1977. The mission of the organization was broadly conceived, so that it
        could serve as a resource for the numerous local, state, and national human rights
        organizations engaged in the struggle to eliminate discrimination in all forms. Although
        civil rights for lesbians and gay men were not to be the sole focus of the organization, the
        provision of educational materials and legal advice concerning issues surrounding sexual
        orientation was identified from the outset as a primary goal for the organization.</p>
      <p>In its early years M.O.H.R. meetings rotated around the state, primarily in the southeast.
        In September 1978, a staffed office was established in Detroit and an executive director was
        hired to guide the organization's lobbying, outreach, and fundraising efforts. By 1979, the
        funding of a staffed office and time commitments required for M.O.H.R. work were causing
        unforeseen pressures on both the organization and those who directed it. The resulting
        resignation of the first executive director led to the first in a series of reorganizations.
        The dependence of M.O.H.R. on financial contributions from its constituent organizations
        proved untenable and, by the early 1980s, the organization had shifted its primary appeal to
        individual members.</p>
      <p>Although very effective in the political arena, as evidenced by the success of the
        M.O.H.R.-directed Michigan Privacy Challenge (1988-1990), the organization continued to be
        plagued with personality conflicts and clashes over its financial commitments and
        priorities. The latter half of the 1980s were marked by frequent resignations, reform
        proposals, and dire predictions from factions of the Board of Directors.</p>
      <p>The organization met with many successes in its attempts to keep both the public and
        lawmakers informed about issues of concern to Michigan's lesbian and gay communities.
        Arguably, M.O.H.R.'s greatest success was the Michigan Privacy Challenge (1988-1990), a
        series of lawsuits filed by the organization on behalf of individual plaintiffs that
        challenged the constitutionality of Michigan's sodomy and gross indecency laws. The Wayne
        County Circuit Court's decision in 1990 supported M.O.H.R.'s position and was not appealed
        by the State of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Other successful M.O.H.R. accomplishments include several court cases involving the rights
        of lesbian mothers and of persons with AIDS; continuous lobbying of the Michigan legislature
        for increased funding of AIDS research, education, and care; lobbying several Michigan
        municipalities for domestic partnership and non-discrimination ordinances; and helping to
        organize annual Pride Parades in southeastern Michigan. In the area of education, M.O.H.R.
        maintained a presence on both radio and cable television as a means of informing the public
        about issues concerning discrimination based on sexual preference and about the prevention
        and treatment of AIDS.</p>
      <p>Despite these successes, the political and interpersonal struggles occurring throughout the
        1980s resulted in mistrust and bad feelings toward the organization among its constituents
        in southeastern Michigan. Combined with the founding of new lesbian and gay male social and
        political organizations in the area's urban centers, this led to a diminution of M.O.H.R.'s
        political effectiveness and fundraising capabilities. After one final reorganization
        attempt, the Michigan Organization for Human Rights disbanded in Spring 1994.</p>
      <p>In 1973, WDET-Detroit began airing a weekly radio program, "Gayly Speaking," which
        continued until 1982. As Detroit's first radio program "by, for, and about gays and gay
        liberation," the program focused on such topics as coming out, oppression, religion, and
        gays in film, theater, literature, and music. Programs always included a news and
        announcement segment and often featured prominent organizations and events, such as Gay
        Pride Week, Detroit's Gay Community Center, and the Gay Switchboard. In 1982, WDET replaced
        "Gayly Speaking" with "Another Voice," a new program syndicated by M.O.H.R.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <p>The records of the Michigan Organization for Human Rights, measuring 10 linear feet, were
        donated to the library by M.O.H.R. in four accessions: May 1983, February and September
        1994, and September 1998. The audio materials span the time period 1973 to 1980, while the
        manuscript materials cover the period from 1977 through the disbanding of the organization
        in Spring, 1994. The records are arranged in eight series: Administrative, Correspondence,
        Topical, Clippings, the Robert Lundy Papers (two series), Visual Materials, and Audio
        Materials. The series provide documentation of the founding, growth, and topical interests
        of a grassroots political and social organization, including the stresses involving
        fundraising and personality conflicts that occurred as M.O.H.R. experienced rapid growth
        during the late-1970s and early-1980s.</p>
      <p>The two Robert Lundy series (1970-1995, 4 linear feet) were donated to the library in
        several accessions over a period of years. There is some overlap as each series contains
        files on legislation, files relating to his work with M.O.H.R., and topical files on issues
        organizations and events with which he was active in his capacity as M.O.H.R.'s legislation
        officer.</p>

          <p>The Administrative series (1977-1994, 1 linear foot) contains annual reports, meeting
            agendas and minutes, and correspondence relating to the activities of the M.O.H.R.
            administrative board (which changed official names three times) and several committees
            thereof. It also contains a small amount of summary financial reports and fliers and
            information relating to the M.O.H.R. annual meeting, as well as office policies and
            procedures. This series provides excellent documentation concerning M.O.H.R.'s rapid
            transformation from a relatively small, issue-oriented umbrella organization into a
            large political and social organization for all southern Michigan lesbians and gay men.
            It also provides information regarding the internal strife which resulted in several
            major reorganizations and the eventual disbanding of M.O.H.R.</p>

          <p>This series of Lundy files contains materials kept separate from previous accessions
            perhaps because they represented continuing working papers. Included are additional
            files on legislation and local ordinances of concern to the gay/lesbian community and
            miscellaneous topical files mainly concerning AIDS. There is obviously some overlap of
            dating and subject between this series and the previous Lundy files.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series (1986-1992; .3 linear feet and 1 oversized folder) contains
            mostly photographs of Gay Pride parades in Lansing and Detroit. Except for a series of
            1988 photographs by Allan Glassman, the photographers are unidentified. In addition to
            the parade photographs are images of a Michigan Privacy Challenge demonstration in
            Detroit and of a fundraising dinner held in Lansing by M.O.H.R. in 1992. Among the
            guests of honor were the gay male weightlifting couple Rod and Bob Jackson/Paris. The
            posters found in this series announce meeting times for gay/lesbian organizations.</p>

          <p>The Audio Materials series (1973-1980, 3 linear feet, 83 tapes) contains reel-to-reel
            tapes. These tapes were part of the original accession of M.O.H.R. records and, while
            produced before the founding of the organization, several of those involved with the
            radio program Gayly Speaking went on to play significant roles in M.O.H.R. after 1977.
            Topical coverage includes a wide variety of political and social issues which affected
            the lives of lesbians and gay men in the mid- to late-1970s, as well as the cultural
            activities of and public service information for the Detroit-area lesbian and gay
            community.</p>
          <p>There are numerous chronological gaps in this series, with representation heaviest and
            most consistent for the early years of the program, 1973 to 1976. Coverage of the years
            1977 to 1980 is very sketchy. The original numbering sequence of the tapes and their
            broadcast dates, as transcribed from the outside of individual tape boxes, have been
            retained as an organizational scheme. It should be noted that brackets in these dates
            have been transcribed as they appear on the boxes. Recording dates have been noted in
            the container listing when known, as have playback speeds.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series (1982-1993, .6 linear feet) contains much of the fundraising
            and lobbying correspondence of M.O.H.R., as well as letters to and from individual
            members and non-members relating to the various social and political concerns of
            lesbians and gay men. The arrangement of the files as received from the donor has been
            retained; therefore, incoming and outgoing correspondence is separated for some years
            and not for others and some correspondence may be found in the Administrative and
            Topical series files.</p>
