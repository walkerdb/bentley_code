The physical arrangement of the papers reflects the sequence of accessions, since materials were processed as each accession was acquired. Materials received and processed prior to 1993 are located in boxes 1-2. Materials received and processed in 1998 are located in Boxes 3-5. For this on-line finding aid the papers are described in their logical rather than physical order. Similar series are brought together regardless of the point at which they arrived at the library.

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Marie Dorothy Hartwig was born on August 1, 1906 in East Orange, New Jersey. She attended Detroit Northwestern High School and did undergraduate work at the University of Michigan, where she received an A.B. degree in Fine Arts in 1929. Thereafter, she worked at the newly opened Michigan League, advancing from desk clerk in 1929 to secretary to manager in 1930. She became an instructor in the Department of Physical Education for Women (DPEW) in 1930. She remained a student at the University of Michigan and completed her B.S.Ed. degree in physical education in 1932 and her M.A. degree in the same subject in 1938. She was promoted to associate supervisor at the DPEW in 1942, to supervisor in 1951, to associate professor in 1968, and to professor in 1969. When the DPEW joined the Department of Physical Education for Men to form the Department of Physical Education in 1970, Hartwig was made a professor, and remained in this capacity until her retirement in 1976. She has been professor emerita since 1977.</p>
      <p>Marie Hartwig was also very active in summer programs of the University of Michigan. She was an instructor in DPEW summer sessions from 1931 to 1938 and from 1940 to 1943. She also worked with the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan, serving on the Counselor Education staff from 1944 until 1948 and as the director of the Counselor Education Program from 1949 until 1982.</p>
      <p>Hartwig was active in a wide variety of organizations pertaining directly or indirectly to her professional work in physical education. These included the Ann Arbor Club of Michigan Alumnae (1939-1984), the Michigan Education Association (1939-1957), the National Education Association (1939-1957), the Michigan Camping Association (1949-1968), the American Camping Association (1949-1968), the Ann Arbor Figure Skating Club (1941-1957), and the Michigan Women's Athletic Association. She held offices in many of these as well as other organizations. For example, she was a member of the Ann Arbor Community Center Board (1979-1982), of the Board of Directors of the United Fund (1959-1962), and of the Board of Directors of the Michigan League (1980-1987).</p>
      <p>Marie Hartwig also gave speeches and other presentations to a wide range of groups. She published articles, manuals, and books, and served as the editor of the periodical <title render="italic">Sportslight</title> from 1939 to 1949. A list of her degrees, appointments, organization memberships, presentations, and publications has been placed in the Biography folder in box 1.</p>

          <p>The Instructional, Publications, and Biographical Material series documents Marie Hartwig's activities as an author and teacher. The bulk of this series consists of Hartwig's handouts, curricular plans, and student assignments for classes she taught at the University of Michigan. School work from the 1930s and instructional material from the 1930s to the 1970s show the development of her ideas and methods. This series documents the more personal aspects of her career and intellectual life, yet complements materials in the other two series that document her role and impact at the University of Michigan and the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan Files series is highlighted by information about Marie Hartwig's work with the Michigan Women's Athletic Association. Materials about the Michigan League's history and Marie Hartwig's service on its Board of Governors from 1980 to 1987 are also included. Box 2 contains material--including copies of programs--concerning Lantern Night, Spring Weekend, and Michigras, all student activities in which the DPEW participated.</p>
          <p>The University of Michigan Files series documents Hartwig's activities as a faculty member, administrator, committee member, and advisor at the University of Michigan. Hartwig's active role in the DPEW is well represented, particularly in respect to the construction of new athletic facilities, revision of the curriculum, establishment of staff standards, and methods of evaluation. Other materials show Hartwig organizing conferences, intramurals, and intercollegiate athletics. This series also contains reports, financial records, and correspondence from the Women's Athletic Association, which Hartwig advised. Also of interest are statistical data gathered under Hartwig's direction about women's recreation in the 1930s and 1960s. Furthermore, this series contains materials Hartwig came to possess from the DPEW, its staff, and the Women's Athletic Building, but which is not directly related to her activities.</p>

          <p>The Camp Activities series primarily contains material relating to Hartwig's work with the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan. Part of this series documents Hartwig's instrumental role in the establishment and supervision of the Counselor Education Program. Valuable materials include correspondence, statements of purpose, instructional materials, brochures, and students' evaluations of their experiences. Other materials in the series resulted from Hartwig's activities as camp coordinator, such as the selection of counseling staff, planning of pre-camp workshops for directors and counselors, and supervision of division and recreation directors. Numerous materials show Hartwig's interest in camp recreation. Photographs document recreational activities of campers and counselors-in-training in the 1950s and 1960s. Her records about social and recreational activities for campers present another perspective of campers' experiences at the National Music Camp, outside of their musical or artistic pursuits. The Bentley Historical Library also holds the records of the Interlochen Center for the Arts, which include material about the National Music Camp.</p>
