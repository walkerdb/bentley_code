    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Mike Wallace was born Myron Leon Wallace on May 9, 1918 in Brookline, Massachusetts to Russian Jewish immigrants family. He graduated from Brookline High School in 1935 then attended the University of Michigan where he had opportunity to work as an announcer at the University's radio division. After graduating in 1939 with a BA degree, Wallace began his broadcasting career first at Grand Rapids, Mich. WOOD-WASH radio station, and then at Detroit's WXYZ, where his work included newscasting as well as narration on <title render="italic">The Green Hornet</title>.</p>
      <p>In 1941 Wallace was hired by the <title render="italic">Chicago Sun</title>'s radio station as a newscaster, but soon wartime service as a naval communications officer interrupted his career. After the war, he went to work as a news reporter for radio station WMAQ Chicago. He first joined CBS in 1951 then left the network in 1955 to pursue other opportunities. He worked steadily with numerous television credits including <title render="italic">Night Beat</title> (1956-57) and <title render="italic">The Mike Wallace Interview</title> (1957-60) and the Peabody Award-winning public affairs series <title render="italic">Biography</title> (1959-61). He returned to CBS in 1963 where he became a staff correspondent (1963-2006) and anchored <title render="italic">The CBS Morning News</title> (1963-66). At CBS Wallace was political correspondent and a floor reporter at the Democratic and Republican conventions in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
      <p>In 1968 CBS News executive producer Don Hewitt, with co-editors Mike Wallace and Harry Reasoner, launched <title render="italic">60 Minutes.</title> Premiering on September 24, the program was a weekly newsmagazine that revolutionized television news programming. In at the beginning, Wallace continued to work on the program until his retirement in 2006.</p>
      <p>Throughout his career, Wallace has been the recipient of numerous broadcasting awards and honors. In 1996 he won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award grand prize and television first prize for a CBS Reports broadcast "In the Killing Fields of America" (January 1995), a three-hour report he co-anchored on violence in America. His other professional honors include 21 Emmy Awards, five Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards, five George Foster Peabody Awards, a Robert E. Sherwood Award, a Paul White Award (1991), a Distinguished Achievement Award from the University of Southern California School of Journalism and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award in the international broadcast category.</p>
      <p>Wallace was elected a fellow of the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi (November 1975) and was awarded a doctorate in humane letters, honoris causa, from the University of Massachusetts (1978). In May 1987 he received an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Michigan and, in 1989 an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>In June of 1991 he was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. In 1993 he was named the Broadcaster of the Year by the International Radio and Television Society. Part of his rich legacy includes the Knight-Wallace Fellowship and Mike and Mary Wallace House at the University of Michigan. Wallace's donations support this in-residence study program begun in 1994 for professional journalists seeking to improve their knowledge in a desired field or issue.</p>
      <p>Wallace was a popular speaker on the lecture circuit and author of several books. His book <title render="italic">Mike Wallace Asks</title>, a compilation of interviews from "Night Beat" and "The Mike Wallace Interview," was published in 1958 and his memoir <title render="italic">Close Encounter</title>, co-authored with Gary Paul Gates, was published in September 1984. In 2002 his book <title render="italic">Medal of Honor: Profiles of America's Military Heroes from the Civil War to the Present</title> co-authored with Allen Mikaelian, was published.</p>
      <p>Mike Wallace died at his home in Canaan, CT on <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="2012-04-07">April 7, 2012</unitdate> at age 93.</p>

          <p>The Program Files series is the largest in the collection and dates from 1968 (when <title render="italic">60 Minutes</title> premiered) to 2007 and is arranged by television schedule years (beginning in September). The content of the Program Files has changed over time and this accounts for some of the subseries that were developed with the passage of time. For the first few years, these files consisted only of the transcripts of the program as aired. Whatever background information was collected or if any post-program material was received, these were usually filed with the collection's General Files (described below). Beginning around 1975, the Program Files began to include, in addition to the broadcast transcript, all of the materials (clippings, articles, producer memoranda, viewer suggestions, transcripts of interviews with participants, etc.) accumulated in connection with the background preparation for any given story. Responses to stories, such as update information, viewer correspondence, and newspaper articles, were also now included in the individual program file. This post-program materials would remain with Program Files until the 1986/87 season when it was transferred again to the General Files.</p>
          <p>An important subseries of the Program Files consists of story ideas in various stages of development that were dropped or never aired for whatever reason. Initially, this subseries was designated as "Dead Story" materials and covered the period from 1981 to 1990. Included were clippings, correspondence, and memoranda from producers and others with suggestions for possible program segments. Prior to 1981, story suggestion files were usually maintained as part of the General Files series. Around 1990, the content of the Program Files series again changed and thus was created a subseries of background materials for stories both aired and proposed. Because there is often overlap between the program file and the background file for a given story in the 1990s, the researcher is encouraged to consult both.</p>
          <p>Concluding the Program Files is a set of binders containing copies of transcripts for <title render="italic">60 Minutes</title> and other Mike Wallace programs such as <title render="italic">CBS Reports</title> and his <title render="italic">Biography</title> program. This portion of the collection only covers the period up to 1990.</p>

          <p>The second largest series in the collection is the General Files which date from 1964 to 2006 with a few scattered files dating from as early as 1957. The researcher should note that Mike Wallace had previously donated to the library papers covering his career in television in the 1950s prior to coming to CBS. These papers do not form part of the CBS/60 Minute files described within this finding aid.</p>
          <p>The General Files are a combination of personal and professional materials covering (as indicated) facets of <title render="italic">60 Minutes</title> programming as well as Wallace's other responsibilities within CBS News, notably his work covering the war in Vietnam and political campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s. Included within the General Files are CBS administrative memoranda and expense reports; correspondence with colleagues, friends, and viewers; personal files detailing speech engagements, and documentation of charitable and other professional activities. As mentioned, the General Files before 1980 includes topical files with accumulated information on potential or actual <title render="italic">60 Minutes</title> program segments. After 1980, these files were placed within the Program Files.</p>

            <p>Personal photographs are mostly formal and informal portraits of Wallace and members of his family, dating from 1922, as well as photographs taken during award ceremonies and various public events. A large portion of professional photographs relates to <title render="italic">60 Minutes</title> segments and other broadcasts between 1967 and 1993. The photographs illumine the behind-the-scenes of <title render="italic">60 Minute</title> segments and of Wallace's interaction with political and social notables: presidents, entertainment and sports figures, and headline makers in general. Among photographs are images from the 1968 Richard Nixon campaign, Robert F. Kennedy, Israeli military leader and politician Moshe Dayan, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, leader of the Communist Party of China Deng Xiaoping, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Attorney General John Mitchell, the Black Panther party leader Eldridge Cleaver, composers Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copeland, pianist Vladimir Horowitz, actress Bette Davis, entertainer Johnny Carson, boxer Mohammad Ali, among others.</p>
