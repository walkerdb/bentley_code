      <p>The Michigan Audubon Society was formed in 1904. Michigan was the thirty-fourth state to organize an Audubon society. The Michigan society, like all Audubon societies, evolved out of the "protection committee" of the American Ornithologists' Union. In 1904 William Dutcher, the chairman of the committee, wrote that the Audubon movement was the outgrowth of well known ornithologist J.J. Audubon's "love of nature and his desire to preserve birds." In 1904 the society listed its purposes as the following: "To disseminate information respecting the economic value of birds to agriculture, and their importance to the welfare of man; to discourage the purpose or use of feathers of birds for ornamentation, except those of the ostrich and domesticated fowl; to discourage the destruction of wild birds and their eggs, except for scientific purposes; to establish Bird day exercises in the schools of the State of Michigan, in connection with the celebration of Arbor Day and to encourage the introduction of bird study in schools." At the time the club was formed birds were being "destroyed and exploited." Officers of the society often gave lectures, and distributed pamphlets, bulletins and leaflets, throughout the state in order to educate the public about the destruction of birds.</p>
      <p>Since its formation the society has continued its bird protection efforts and has greatly expanded the scope of its activities. In 1923 a society newsletter was started. This newsletter later grew into a quarterly journal called Jack Pine Warbler. In 1929 the society organized a statewide poll of school children in order to select a state bird. The society also established Junior Recruit and Junior Audubon programs, and began holding summer nature camps for children. The society also began to lobby for legislation which would assist in their bird protection efforts. Local chapters of the society began to form, to assist in the efforts of the state organization.</p>
      <p>Over time the society became involved in more general conservation efforts. In addition to the preservation and protection of birds, it became a goal of the society to "conserve the wildlife and the natural beauty in Michigan in all practical ways and to cooperate with other organizations which are working for true conservation of natural resources." The society acquired the Bernard Baker Sanctuary in Calhoun County, the Seven Ponds Nature Sanctuary in Lapeer County, and the Sarrett Nature Sanctuary in St. Joseph Valley, and worked to promote legislation which would protect birds, and the environment as a whole. Today the Michigan Audubon Society has over 10,000 members, and continues its varied conservation efforts.</p>
