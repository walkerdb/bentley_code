      <p>Aldred Scott Warthin was a pathologist, teacher, and author of international reputation who served the University of Michigan Medical School as director of the Pathology Laboratory from 1903 until his death in 1931.</p>
      <p>Born in Greensburg, Indiana in 1866, as a youth Warthin often accompanied his physician uncle collecting specimens. He also took piano lessons to please his invalid mother and entered the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, where, in 1887, he was awarded a teacher's diploma. Warthin attended Indiana University, where he pursued his interest in science and received an A.B. degree in 1888. Warthin then entered the University of Michigan Medical School, supporting himself by teaching music lessons and serving as a church organist. In 1891 he was awarded an M.D., followed by a Ph.D. in 1893.</p>
      <p>Warthin began his medical career as an assistant and demonstrator in internal medicine at the university. He assumed charge of the pathology laboratory in 1896. He requested all specimens from clinics be sent to him for diagnosis and soon established a close relationship between pathology and clinical medicine. In 1903 he was named director of the lab and professor. From 1893 to 1900 Warthin spent his summers in European pathology laboratories in Vienna, Dresden, and Freiburg.</p>
      <p>Subjects of particular interest to Warthin ranged from the problems of tuberculosis to the importance of constitution and heredity in leukemia and hemolymph nodes as well as genetic tendencies to cancer and constitutional aspects of hyperthyroidism. Following World War I he carried on extensive work on the pathology of mustard gas poisoning. He also addressed the social hygiene problems inherent in the spread of venereal diseases at this time. The last twenty years of his life were devoted to the study of the pathology of syphilis particularly involving the heart, aorta, pancreas, adrenals and testes.</p>
      <p>Warthin's writings appeared in the form of pathology textbooks and translations, as well as articles in journals and textbooks. From 1924 to 1931 Warthin served as editor of the <title render="italic">Annals of Clinical Medicine</title> (later the <title render="italic">Annals of Internal Medicine</title>). Among the books he authored is <title render="italic">The Physician of the Dance of Death</title> (1931), a work prompted by his interest in books and pictures he collected which depicted the "Dance of Death." This volume and two others, <title render="italic">Old Age- The Major Involution</title> (1929) and <title render="italic">The Creed of a Biologist</title> (1930), reflected Warthin's thinking on immortality and human nature.</p>
      <p>In 1927 he was presented with a special tribute, a "Festschrift" comprised of fifty-eight contributions to medical science from his students and early teachers. Warthin was also awarded the Henry Russel Award in 1929 by the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>At the Race Betterment conference in Battle Creek in 1928, Warthin expressed his controversial views that religion and the concept of forgiveness of sin only served to harm the human race by the continual transmission of social diseases. He also discouraged marrying for romantic love and encouraged those contemplating marriage to check fully into their ancestral backgrounds to avoid the transmittal of inheritable disease to future generations. Warthin believed the only means to physical betterment and long life came through eugenics.</p>
      <p>Warthin was prominently involved in professional organizations, serving as the president for many of them. These presidencies included the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists in 1908, International Association of Medical Museums from 1910 to 1913, American Society for Experimental Pathology in 1924, Association of American Physicians in 1924, American Association for Cancer Research in 1928, and the American Association of the History of Medicine, 1930-1931. He served as well as the vice president of the American Association of Physicians from 1925 until his death. He died in Ann Arbor in 1931.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series (1893-1947) is divided into three subseries: General, Personal, and Miscellaneous. General Correspondence concerns a variety of topics, mainly medical, including discussions of writings, studies, lectures, and clarifications of laboratory procedures. Personal Correspondence contains correspondence reflecting personal and family concerns. Of particular interest are two letters written by Warthin to "Dear Friend" from Vienna in the summers of 1893 and 1894 in which he shares his reactions to life in Vienna and the medical processes of the time. Also included is a folder of correspondence from Sir William Osler, who in many ways was Warthin's mentor. Miscellaneous Correspondence contains correspondence received by Warthin and Dr. Carl Vernon Weller. Weller served on the staff with Warthin and succeeded him as chairman of the Department of Pathology. Some of the correspondence addressed to Weller is written after Warthin's death which accounts for the collection's later dates.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series (1896-1930) is divided into five subseries: Associations and Organizations; Medical Museums; Medical Opinions, Advice and Studies; Publications; and University of Michigan.

            <p>The dates of the Associations and Organizations files range from 1923 to 1930 and often reflect Warthin's official duties within the organization as well as his relations with other physicians of a national reputation. The American Association for Cancer Research file includes Warthin's 1928 presidential address and the Association of American Physicians file includes his 1928 address for that organization. Extensive correspondence with Dr. Frank Smithies, prior editor of the <title render="italic">Annals of Clinical Medicine</title>, is included in the American College of Physicians file. The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (American Society for Experimental Pathology) contains correspondence with E.B. Krumbhaar in which Warthin expresses his concerns for the profession and its need for new practitioners. The Archives of Pathology contains correspondence with Ludwig Hektoen and the Rockefeller Foundation file contains correspondence with Nobel Prize winner Peyton Rous.</p>

          <p>The Writings series (1909-1931) consists of manuscripts of many of Warthin's publications as well as correspondence with those directly involved in the publication of the various journals for which he wrote. The Publications subseries contains both alphabetical and chronological materials. The Alphabetical files relate to specific publications authored by Warthin in the period from 1916 to 1931. Although primarily correspondence, some abstracts and completed articles are also included. The Chronological files consist primarily of correspondence with various editors and publishers with regard to Warthin's articles and texts. Also included in these materials are three folders of Responses to Publications which further document the respect Warthin had garnered nationally.</p>
          <p>The Manuscripts subseries (1909-1931) also contains both alphabetical and chronological materials. The Alphabetical files contains manuscripts of several of the books and articles Warthin authored. Those included in these files tend to be rather complete. The Chronological files, on the other hand, are often untitled and occasionally incomplete in their contents. Items in the Reprints subseries include a variety of articles appearing in journals.</p>

          <p>The Biographical/ Personal series (1893-1936) is comprised of an 1893 diary written while Warthin was en route on his first trip to Vienna. The Tributes file includes resolutions passed in honor of Warthin following his death as well as related correspondence. The bulk of the Clippings file consists of Warthin obituaries and a small number of clippings which appeared prior to his death. Contained in the Photographs are several portraits of Warthin dating from 1898 to 1926.</p>

          <p>The <title>Annal of Clinical Medicine</title> series (1923-1930) begins in 1924 with the transfer of the editorship of the journal to Warthin. Included in the files are correspondence with the publisher as well as with contributors to various issues. Those files with a designation for a specific month include Warthin's contributions as editor, more specifically editorials, reviews, and abstracts. In 1927 the journal changed title to <title render="italic">Annals of Internal Medicine</title>.</p>
