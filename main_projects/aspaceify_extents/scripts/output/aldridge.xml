        <p>The John W. Aldridge Papers were received by the Bentley as 19 linear feet of records in March 2009, through Patricia Aldridge, John W. Aldridge's widow. While some of these records clearly reflected Aldridge's original organizational schema, the majority of the records lacked any indication of original order. The processor attempted to respect this original order in so far as was possible, but at the same time imposed an organizational structure onto the records.</p>
        <p>The Correspondence series mirrors Aldridge's own organizational schema in which Aldridge maintained separate files for some correspondents, while grouping other letters together by year. The materials in series were loosely organized chronologically by twenty year periods, but were not in chronological order. Thus, in processing the correspondence, the processor adhered to the implied organizational structure and organized the letters both by year and correspondent. In some cases, as with the Norman Mailer correspondence, some letters were originally filled by name and others by decade. In cases such as these, with major literary figures or important correspondents, the processor filled the letters by correspondent name. .</p>
        <p>The records in the Biographical Materials, Hopwood Awards Program, and Lectures and Addresses series were all combined together and the processor imposed an organizational structure upon them. The materials in the USIA/Special Ambassador, Teaching, and Writing series were roughly organized, that is, segregated from one another, but not organized at any greater level of detail. Thus, the processor organized the different components of these series into more discernible subseries and levels. The Scrapbooks and Audio-Visual Materials series reflect the original order of the files as received by the Bentley.</p>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>John (Jack) Watson Aldridge was an esteemed literary critic and professor of English at the University of Michigan (1964-1991). As a critic, Aldridge devoted himself to what he called "the ideal of creative independence and free critical dissent which has come down to us in the central tradition of American thought and letters," (<title render="italic">Current Biography</title>, 1958) and throughout his career he commented upon and critiqued many of the twentieth century's most important writers, including Joseph Heller, Norman Mailer, Ralph Ellison, John Horne Burns, Malcolm Cowley, Arthur Miller, Gore Vidal, Wright Morris, Saul Bellow, William Styron, Philip Roth, and Truman Capote, many of whom he also counted as his friends.</p>
      <p>John W. Aldridge was born on September 26, 1922 in Sioux City, Iowa to Walther Copher and Nell Madge (Watson) Aldridge. Aldridge spent his early years in Iowa, until the age of twelve, when the family moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Aldridge attend the University of Chattanooga (now the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga) from 1940 to 1943, and studied English during the summer of 1942 at Middlebury College's School of English at Bread Loaf in Vermont, prior to enlisting in the Army and serving in World War II as an infantry rifleman and information specialist (July 1943- August 1945). Following his military service, during which he earned a Bronze Star and five battle stars for Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Central Europe, and the Ardennes, Aldridge enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley in 1946. At Berkeley, Aldridge worked as the editor of the school's <title render="italic">Occident</title> literary magazine, and earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1947.</p>
      <p>Prior to coming to the University of Michigan, Aldridge was a lecturer and later assistant professor at the University of Vermont (1948-1950, 1954-1955), a lecturer for the Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism at Princeton University (1953-1955), and a visiting professor at Sarah Lawrence College (1956-1957), Queens College of the City of New York (1957), and New York University (1958). Aldridge also served as a Fulbright Lecturer at the University of Munich (1958-1959) and the University of Copenhagen (1962-1963), and as critic-in-residence and visiting professor at Hollins College (1959-1962).</p>
      <p>Aldridge came to the University of Michigan in 1964 as a visiting associate professor of English language and literature, and was promoted to professor in 1965. Aldridge was well-known at Michigan for his lectures on the contemporary novel, and his students heralded his teaching abilities. In addition to guiding the scholarship of scores of graduate and undergraduate students, Aldridge also served as the chair of the editorial board of the <title render="italic">Michigan Quarterly Review</title> (1978-1992), and director of the Hopwood Program at the University of Michigan and chair of the Hopwood Writing Awards Committee (1975-1988).</p>
      <p>In addition to traditional academic appointments, Aldridge also served as a Special Ambassador for American Studies at the American Embassy in Bonn, Germany (1972-1973), as a book commentator and reviewer for "The MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour" on public television, and as a book critic for the <title render="italic">New York Herald Tribune Book Week</title> (1965-1966) and the <title render="italic">Saturday Review</title> (1970-1979). Aldridge was also the recipient of a Rockefeller Humanities Fellowship for the 1976-1977 academic year.</p>
      <p>Aldridge was an active writer and critic throughout his career, publishing numerous essays and book reviews in a wide range of publications, including <title render="italic">Harper's Magazine</title>, <title render="italic">Saturday Review</title>, <title render="italic">New York Times Book Review</title>, <title render="italic">Partisan Review</title>, <title render="italic">Nation</title>, <title render="italic">Playboy</title>, <title render="italic">Commentary</title>, <title render="italic">The Sewanee Review</title>, <title render="italic">Michigan Quarterly Review</title>, <title render="italic">The American Scholar</title>, <title render="italic">Chronicles</title>, <title render="italic">Esquire</title>, <title render="italic">Chicago Tribune Book World</title>, <title render="italic">New Republic</title>, <title render="italic">New York Herald Tribune Book Week</title>, and <title render="italic">Life</title>. Aldridge was also a co-founder, with author Vance Bourjaily, in 1951 of <title render="italic">Discovery</title> magazine, an influential literary magazine published by Pocket Books.</p>
      <p>In addition to writing regular essays and book reviews, Aldridge was the author of numerous works of literary criticism, a novel <title render="italic">The Party at Cranton</title>, and a sociological study of youth culture, <title render="italic">In the Country of the Young.</title> Aldridge considered his literary criticism of contemporary writers his most important work, however, telling <title render="italic">Contemporary Authors</title> (Gale, 2002), "I am, and have always wanted to be, a critic of the literature of my own time. With the exception of my novel, <title render="italic">The Party at Cranton</title>, and an informal sociological study <title render="italic">, In the Country of the Young</title>, my books have all been studies of current literature, primarily American fiction. I have never considered criticism in any sense a minor or inferior literary form, and one of my ambitions has been to write criticism in such a way that it can be seen to have the qualities of style, structure, and dramatic development which are normally associated with fiction." Aldridge placed such primacy on his critical works that he devoted a substantial portion of his unpublished autobiography, <title render="italic">Against the Current</title>, to discussions of the intellectual bases of his criticism and the sometimes laudatory, sometimes negative, reception it received.</p>
      <p>Aldridge's first book of criticism <title render="italic">After the Lost Generation</title> (1951), was one of the first critical treatment of major post-war writers such as Norman Mailer, John Horne Burns, Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, and others, and earned Aldridge high acclaim in the literary world and established his reputation as one of the foremost literary critics of his generation. When <title render="italic">After the Lost Generation</title> was reprinted in 1985, Norman Mailer wrote in the "Introduction," that "Aldridge was the nearest guideline to absolute truth that the working novelist had in my young days. I wonder if there was ever a critic who understood any better the roots of the problems that beset the novelists of his own generation." Aldridge's literary criticism incited strong reactions amongst those in the literary world, with Gore Vidal including him in a list of "literary gangsters." Aldridge, however, relished the impassioned responses to his work, saying, "I suppose I have had what is called a 'controversial' career. All my books have provoked argument and discussion. And, I am pleased that this should be so, for I function best in an atmosphere of controversy and would very probably die if I were ever read with indifference." (<title render="italic">World Authors, 1950-1970</title>, 1975)</p>
      <p>During the long course of his career Aldridge contributed introductions, forewords, and essays to numerous works, in addition to serving as an editor for <title render="italic">Critiques and Essays on Modern Fiction</title> (1952) and <title render="italic">Selected Stories of P.G. Wodehouse</title> (1958). Aldridge was also the author of nine books: <title render="italic">After the Lost Generation</title> (1951), <title render="italic">In Search of Heresy: American Literature in an Age of Conformity</title> (1956), <title render="italic">The Party at Cranton</title> (1960), <title render="italic">Time to Murder and Create</title> (1966), <title render="italic">In the Country of the Young</title> (1970), <title render="italic">The Devil in the Fire</title> (1972), <title render="italic">The American Novel and the Way We Live Now</title> (1983), <title render="italic">Talents and Technicians</title> (1992), and <title render="italic">Classics and Contemporaries</title> (1992).</p>
      <p>Aldridge retired as an University of Michigan professor of English in 1991. While in retirement with emeritus status (1991-2007), Aldridge maintained an active scholarly lifestyle and continued producing articles and book reviews, as well as writing two unpublished manuscripts <title render="italic">In the Company of Lions</title>, a work of criticism, and <title render="italic">Against the Current</title>, a memoir. Married five times and the father of five sons, John W. Aldridge died February 7, 2007.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series, 1943-2006 (3 linear ft.), contains correspondence both to and from John W. Aldridge over a 66 year span. The series is organized into subseries chronologically by year, as well as by correspondent. In addition to personal and business letters, this series also includes a subseries of letters of recommendation Aldridge wrote on his students and colleagues' behalf. Noteworthy materials in this series include a 53 year correspondence with Aldridge's friend Grant Genung and correspondence with four of Aldridge's wives, as well as original and photocopied letters from William J. Buckley, Jr., John Dos Passos, Ralph Ellison, William Gaddis, Donald Hall, Joseph Heller, Norman Mailer, Bernard Malamud, Arthur Miller, Wright Morris, Anäis Nin, William Styron, Lionel Trilling, John Updike, Gore Vidal, Kurt Vonnegut, Robert Penn Warren, Tom Wolfe, and P.G. Wodehouse.</p>
          <p>Researchers should note that while much of the correspondence in the John W. Aldridge Papers can be found in the correspondence series, additional correspondence is located in the Hopwood Awards Program, Lectures and Addresses, Teaching, USIA/Special Ambassador, and Writings series.</p>

          <p>The Audio-Visual series, 1950s-1995 (1 linear ft.), consists of audio and visual materials documenting Aldridge's projects. The series includes video of Aldridge's appearance at a conference on T. Coraghessan Boyle, as well as a video of the series "William Kennedy's Albany," on which Aldridge served as a consultant. There are also two audio cassettes in the series, one with Aldridge's 1979 interview with Norman Mailer, and the other titled "Jack on the Death of Cousin." Additionally, the series contains 21 reel-to-reel audiotapes circa 1950s, one of which contains audio of a dinner hosted by Aldridge and attended by Norman Mailer and William Styron.</p>
