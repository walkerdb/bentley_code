    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>David W. Osler was born in 1921 and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, spending much of his childhood in the family home on Glazier Way. His early adventures in the surrounding seventeen acres of woods and creeks inspired his life-long love of the land and his sensitivity to site in architectural design. He graduated from Ann Arbor's University High School in 1938 and from the University of Michigan in 1942, where he studied design and illustration and was a member of the Big Ten Championship golf team.</p>
      <p>During World War II, Osler enlisted in the Navy and served aboard the assault-transport ship, USS Thomas Jefferson, which deployed the first wave of American soldiers in their landing on Omaha Beach. After returning home in 1946, he married Connie Lorch, whom he had known since the ninth grade. Connie's father, Emil Lorch, was the founder of the University of Michigan Department of Architecture, dean of the School of Architecture and professor from 1906 to 1940. Osler and his wife Connie have three children, all of whom have chosen careers in design. Robin is the founding principal of the New York firm, EOA/ Elmslie Osler Architect, and Peter is the director of the Program of Landscape Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Molly, an interior designer in Ann Arbor, has often collaborated with her father in his architectural projects.</p>
      <p>Osler's first professional job as an architect was with the firm of Douglas D. ("Pete") Loree, Architect. In 1957, Osler became a registered architect in the state of Michigan and established his own firm, David W. Osler, Architect, in the next year. He was among a number of distinguished architects who practiced in the Modern style in the Ann Arbor area in the middle and second half of the twentieth century. His earliest commissions were primarily single-family residences. However, over many decades, Osler developed a diverse portfolio of Ann Arbor projects, some of which included the Oslund Condominiums, Newport West Condominiums, St. Clare of Assisi Episcopal Church, the former Nellie Loving Branch of the Ann Arbor Library, Geddes Lakes Townhouses, and alterations and additions to the Ann Arbor District Library and National Bank and Trust Company. He is also known for his excellence in design of buildings across the state, among them, the Albion College International House and Gerstacker Language Center, the Williams Research Headquarters in Walled Lake, the Fife Electric Company Office and Warehouse in Novi, and the Harry S. Peterson Company Office Building in Orion Township. He was also responsible for the restoration of the historic Beaubien House (built in 1851) in Detroit, and the restoration/expansion of the Howell Carnegie District Library (built in 1906), for which he received the American Institute of Architects (AIA)/American Library Association Library Building Award in 1993.</p>
      <p>During his 50-year career, Osler and his firm received many honors. In 1981, he was elected to the College of Fellows in the American Institute of Architects and was given the Michigan AIA Gold Medal Award in 1996, "for contributions to principled architectural problem-solving and for consistently high standards of design excellence." [1]</p>
      <p>David W. Osler Associates, Inc., Architects, was honored as the Michigan AIA Firm of the Year Award in 2005. Over the decades, the firm received a total of twenty-two Michigan AIA Honor Awards, more than any other office of comparable size in the state, for such projects as the Oslund Condominiums, the Michigan Theater Restoration (with Quinn Evans), National Bank and Trust Company, the Kumasaka Residence, St. Clare of Assisi Episcopal Church, the Wilt Residence and the Nellie S. Loving Branch Library.</p>
      <p>In 1983, Osler was honored as a finalist in the design competition for the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial in Washington, D.C. Of the 1421 competition entries, Osler's design was one of fifteen to receive honorable mention for his submission.</p>
      <p>The architectural offices of Osler's firm were housed during his entire career in the historic, towered Washtenaw Light and Power sub-station (1902), located at 916 Fuller Street in Ann Arbor, which he purchased in a dilapidated state and renovated for his professional use in 1959. In addition to his 50 years of work as a distinguished architect, Osler has served as a University of Michigan School of Architecture adjunct professor and as a nine-year board member of the Washtenaw Metropolitan Planning Commission. Collateral activities on behalf of the architectural profession included service as the president of the local chapter of AIA, secretary of the Michigan AIA and member of the National AIA Committee on Design.</p>
      <p>Osler retired from architectural practice in 2008. As a master of space, form, proportion, color and refinement, he leaves a legacy of design elegance and simplicity and has inspired his followers with his commitment to a high quality of community life through architecture.</p>

          <p>The Professional Papers series includes newspaper and journal articles about Osler and his firm from 1958 to 2012, award citations, award submission notebooks, publicity and marketing materials, and brief project summaries. Researchers will note that there are no client business files in this collection. In the Awards sub-series, the Michigan AIA Gold Medal Award (1996) folder includes letters of support from such notable Michigan architects and landscape architects as Gunnar Birkerts, Robert M. Beckley, Balthazar Korab, Charles W. Cares, S. Glen Paulsen, Robert C. Metcalf, Frederick W Mayer and Carl O. Hueter, among many. The high regard of others in Osler's profession is clearly evident in these letters, as they describe the elements of Osler's work, temperament and design, which elevate him for this award. The AIA Michigan Firm Award (2005) folder was prepared by Osler's office and combines his narrative description of seventeen chosen projects with color photographs of interiors and exteriors.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Award Submission Notebooks in this first series are also of great value to researchers because they combine Osler's own descriptions with professional photographs and architectural drawings of 13 projects in spiral-bound books. Through these, one understands the program and design challenges of each building. The Project Summaries, 1965-1993, sub-series also offers this perspective, with a single-page narrative and images for twenty-nine of his projects. Within the Publicity/Marketing sub-series, the Miniature Perspective Drawings Brochure integrates Osler's art work for thirty-one projects into one tiny book. While the full-sized, original perspectives appear within the Architectural Drawings series, this brochure pulls many together in one effective piece, which highlights the architect's considerable artistic talent.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series includes black-and-white and color prints, which document the exteriors and interiors of some fifty-four of Osler's buildings. Many photographic prints are originals, and some are signed by Greg Hursley of Hursley and Lark and by Balthazar Korab, the renowned Michigan architectural photographer. When indicated on the images, dates and professional photographers are noted. The architect's career is also visually represented in two sets of foam core, accordion, exhibition panels, which combine 72 color prints of unidentified interiors and exteriors with Osler's statement about his influences, values and work.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Architectural Drawings series reflects the diverse design portfolio of David Osler over the five decades of his career, including 1947 perspective, preliminary design and construction drawings for 90 private residences, churches, libraries, office and academic buildings and park facilities. The earliest project, a residence in Barton Hills, Ann Arbor, for Jack Dobson (1956), is documented with original, pencil-on-vellum, construction drawings, as are many of the buildings in the collection. For a number of projects, such as the Cincinnati Hillside Housing Competition, Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Livonia, the Fife Electric Company Office and Warehouse in Novi, and the Hoffman Building in Ann Arbor, only a few perspective drawings are available. However, these beautiful, hand-drawn perspectives illuminate Osler's outstanding artistic skills.</p>
          <p>The projects in this series are listed alphabetically and not chronologically. However, it is evident that, during the 1960s, Osler concentrated on designing single-family residences for friends and clients who had purchased lots in new subdivisions in the Ann Arbor area. By the second decade of his career, the architect was tackling larger commissions, such as Newport West Condominiums and the renovation of National Bank and Trust Company in Ann Arbor. For many of these large projects, full sets of preliminary and construction drawings are included, documenting the entire, sometimes lengthy, design process. The Oslund Condominiums project is represented by twelve folders of drawings, from 1968 through 2003. Other buildings with a large number of design and construction drawings are the Howell Carnegie District Library, the Auburn Hills Public Library, the Brandon Township Public Library in Ortonville, and the Nellie S. Loving Branch Library in Ann Arbor.</p>
          <p>Of particular interest to researchers wishing to exhibit Osler's work are the large 36x48-inch Presentation Boards on poster board and tempered masonite for two of his projects. The Kalamazoo/Arcadia Creek Urban Design and Development Plan has four presentation boards, showing two site plans and twelve perspectives. The Vietnam War Veterans Memorial Competition has two presentation boards, which include perspectives, site plans, and elevation and section drawings. These boards are of particular significance because Osler was honored as a finalist in this nation-wide competition in 1983.</p>
