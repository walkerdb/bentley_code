    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Douglas Ross was born on June 15, 1942. He attended Mumford High School in Detroit, graduating in 1960. He received a B.A. in history from the University of Michigan (1965), pursued graduate studies in economics at the University of Michigan (1965-1966), and the London School of Economics (1964), and received a master's degree in public affairs from Princeton University (1972).</p>
      <p>He has held numerous positions in government, public interest, and business, working for various politicians and political activist groups. In 1967, Ross created and co-directed the Volunteer Placement Corps, an organization funded by New Detroit, Inc., to place inner-city high school graduates in colleges, job training programs, and jobs. In 1973, along with University of Michigan classmate Barbara Grossman, Ross founded the Michigan Citizens Lobby, a non-profit citizens group which has grown to over 100,000 members. Under his leadership, the Lobby was the moving force in the passage of the Generic Prescription Act, the Auto Repair Protection Act, and the repeal of the sales tax on food and medicine. He also served briefly as executive director of Michigan Common Cause in 1975.</p>
      <p>In 1978, Ross left the Michigan Citizens Lobby to run for the State Senate from his home district in Oak Park. He was successful and remained in the State Senate until his unsuccessful bid for a seat in U.S. Congress in 1982.</p>
      <p>Ross continued his political career by serving as Director of Commerce from 1984-1989 under Governor Blanchard, where he was instrumental in reshaping Michigan's economic strategy, worked to make Michigan more attractive to corporations for investment, and re-organized the department to function like a business. He left to serve as president of the Corporation for Enterprise Development, an economic-growth consulting firm.</p>
      <p>Ross founded Michigan Future in 1991 and served as the president. It is a bipartisan group of business and community leaders working to instigate a change and revitalization in Michigan's economy. Through his economic work, Ross became involved with president-elect Bill Clinton. Ross was appointed Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training Administration (ETA) in the U.S. Department of Labor in 1993. During his tenure, the ETA underwent a structural re-organization and focused on improving worker training programs to lower unemployment. He left the post in 1995.</p>
      <p>Doug Ross had begun working as a visiting lecturer at the University of Michigan in 1991. He resumed his teaching when he returned from Washington in 1995. He ran for Michigan Governor in 1998, but lost in the Democratic Primaries to Geoffrey Fieger. Ross then focused his energy on founding a charter school in Detroit. He opened the University Preparatory Academy in 2000 to provide better education for urban youth. The school consists of a middle school and a high school and provides small classes and a customized education. Ross continues to serve as principal of the school.</p>

          <p>Schedule (1.0 linear feet, 1968-2002) provides a record of Ross' meetings and activities throughout his career. The series is composed of appointment books and task lists. The years 1968 to 1985 are covered through appointment books, listing who he was meeting and the topic of discussion but with little detail. The task lists cover 1999-2002. They are lists of meetings, tasks, and goals to be accomplished for that day, week, or month. They have a little more detail than the appointment books. Most entries pertain to Ross founding and running the University Preparatory Academy, a charter school, but also include tasks related to teaching at the University of Michigan and paying off his debt from the gubernatorial race.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (DOL-ETA) series (2 linear feet, 1993-1995) includes materials from Ross' position as the Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training Administration during the Clinton Administration. The papers document his activities as well as those of the ETA. During his tenure, the ETA underwent a structural re-organization. They also worked on the Workforce Security Act of 1994 and focused on creating better programs for training workers to lower unemployment. His personal involvement in the organization is best documented in the "Ross, Douglas" subseries, and includes speeches, articles about him, and papers related to welcoming him and bidding him farewell from the department.</p>
