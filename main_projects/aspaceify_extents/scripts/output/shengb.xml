      <abstract>Bright Sheng, a composer born in China, is also renown as a conductor, pianist, and researcher. The Bright Sheng Collection contains the papers of University of Michigan composition professor Bright Sheng. In addition to Sheng's own files and correspondence, it includes manuscript, printed, and published versions of his scores (printed scores are for musicians' use, while published scores are for a wider audience), published and unpublished recordings of his works, interviews, programs and reviews featuring his works, and work from Sheng's students. Also included are field recordings and an audio diary from the 2000 Silk Road project in China.</abstract>

      <p>Bright Sheng (1955- ) is the Leonard Bernstein Distinguished University Professor of Music in the Composition Department of the University of Michigan's School of Music. Now a widely-renowned composer, conductor, pianist, and researcher, Sheng embarked in music as a career as a teenager in China in the remote province of Qinghai, where he was sent during the Cultural Revolution. After several years performing and studying folk music and dances, Sheng was one of the first students to be admitted to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music when China's universities reopened in 1978. In 1982, Sheng moved to New York, obtaining graduate degrees at Queens College (M.A.) and Columbia University (D.M.A.). While a student, Sheng not only won praise from teachers Leonard Bernstein, George Perle, and others, but also gained citations and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Kennedy Center, and several foundations.</p>
      <p>Since 1998, Sheng has been the Artistic Advisor to the highly regarded Silk Road Project, an international program that identifies, archives, and interprets musical traditions of the peoples in the regions of the trade routes that once were the primary linkage between Europe and the Far East. In this capacity he has conducted field research in outlying provinces in China and has both published articles and composed musical works based on his experiences and findings. Other highlights of Sheng's career include several world premieres by artists and ensembles such as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, Yo-Yo Ma, and Emanuel Ax; collaborations with librettists Andrew Porter, Colin Graham, David Henry Hwang, and others; and numerous guest lectureships, artistic directorships, and residencies at universities and conservatories nationwide. Additionally, in 1999 Sheng was commissioned by the White House to create a new work for a state dinner honoring Chinese Premiere Zhou Rongji. In 2001, Sheng was granted the prestigious MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.</p>
      <p>Orchestras and ensembles have recorded Sheng's music on a variety of labels. Sheng's music is published exclusively by G. Schirmer Inc., and he is represented as a conductor and pianist by Columbia Artists Management.</p>

      <p>The Bright Sheng Collection contains the papers of University of Michigan composition professor Bright Sheng. It is comprised of 17 series: Biographical, 1982-c2000; Correspondence, 1962-2004; Professional, 1997-1998; Career, 1988-1995; Program Notes [undated]; Awards and Citations, 1984-2003; Photographs, 1985-2004; Reviews, 1986-2004; Programs, 1973-2003; Libretti, 1999-2003; Published Scores, 1988-1999; Printed Scores, 1982-2002; Manuscripts and Revised Scores, 1985-2004; Audio Recordings [undated]; Student Works, 1996-2004; Silk Road Trip, 2000; and Moving Images, 1985-2003.

      <p>The first six series in the Bright Sheng Collection are extremely short, with a combined physical extent of approximately .5 linear foot.

The Correspondence, 1962-2004 series contains topical files of Sheng's correspondence with colleagues in China, with his professors, and with his family, as well as a partial chronological file of correspondence falling outside of those three categories. The Professional, 1997-1998 series includes an article written by Sheng, as well as articles in Chinese about Sheng's music. The Career, 1988-1995 series contains materials related to Sheng's various appointments and positions over the years. The Program Notes series contains an article about the Sung Dynasty and the work <title render="italic">Two Poems from the Sung Dynasty</title>. The Awards and Citations, 1984-2003 series includes materials related to various honors Sheng has received in the course of his career, including a MacArthur 'Genius' grant and the University of Michigan's Leonard Bernstein Distinguished University Professorship.</p>

          <p>Finally, the Photographs, 1985-2004 series contains negatives of Sheng, his family, colleagues, and associates in both informal settings and at various premiers, performances, and other engagements. These copy negatives were made from prints loaned by Sheng. Notable figures in these photographs include Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Serkin, Leonard Bernstein, Kurt Mazur, Emanuel Ax, Aaron Copland, and David Henry Hwang. In the detailed listing describing the photographs in the boxlist, numbers in square brackets are arbitrarily assigned identifying numbers, while the number in parentheses is the Bentley Library's negative number.</p>

          <p>The chronologically-arranged Programs, 1973-2003 series contains both season schedules and individual performance stagebills dating from Sheng's days in China to the present. The programs feature both Sheng's own appearances and performances of his compositions, as well as seasons or performances for which Sheng acted as conductor or artistic director. Additionally, the series includes a few stagebills (for events not relating to Sheng or his music) that feature articles about Sheng.</p>

          <p>The Manuscripts and Revised Scores, 1985-2004 series contains Sheng's original, hand-written scores, photocopies thereof, and printed scores with Sheng's hand-written revisions. The series highlights the revision and adaptation that are essential parts of Sheng's composition process by including multiple versions of some of his works. Also of note in the series are three manuscript versions of Leonard Bernstein's <title render="italic">Arias and Barcarolles</title>, as orchestrated by Bright Sheng. These manuscripts include Bernstein's notes as well as Sheng's. For document-housing purposes, size is used to distinguish the oversize versions from the regular size versions. Thus, researchers should look for versions in both size categories.</p>

          <p>The Audio Recordings series is largely comprised of unpublished CDs of 27 performances featuring Sheng's work. It also includes an interview with Sheng broadcast on Voice of America and a published CD containing Sheng's piece <title render="italic">The Stream Flows</title>. The CDs are labeled simply as "CD #" but the description in the contents list below generally includes information on the date of the performances, the orchestra/performers and conductor, and the title of the pieces on the CD. Researchers should note that additional audio recordings, from Sheng's trip along Chinese portions of the Silk Road in the summer of 2000, are included in the Silk Road Trip series.</p>

          <p>The Silk Road Trip, 2000 series documents Bright Sheng's journey in the summer of 2000 to conduct ethnomusicological field work for the Silk Road Project. The trip covered several remote provinces in China, including Qinghai, where he got his start as a composer. Records in this series include Sheng's audio diary; recordings of local folk music; interviews, articles, and other writings about the Silk Road in general and the trip in particular; and numerous slides. The listing for CDs includes the dates of the recordings, the cities or areas in which the recordings were made and a brief description of the subject matter of the recording. Also, included in the "Silk Road Writings" folder is a printout of the website G. Schirmer created (also available at http://www.schirmer.com/silkroad/sheng/) as an companion piece to Sheng's trip. Also in diary format, it was compiled from email reports he sent while in China. Researchers may find it useful to also consult this piece while reviewing the slides or audio diaries from the trip.</p>

        </p>
        <p>"I am 100% Chinese. I am also 100% American" is an identity Chinese-American composer Bright Sheng offers of himself. Born on December 6, 1955 in Shanghai, Sheng began to study piano with his mother at age four. During China's Cultural Revolution, he was sent to the remote province of Qinghai, where for seven years he performed as a pianist and percussionist in a folk music and dance troupe. He also collected and studied folk music during his years in Qinghai. When China's universities reopened in 1978, he was among the first students with the best grades who were admitted to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. He earned his undergraduate degree in music composition there. He moved to New York City in 1982, and received graduate degrees there at Queens College (M.A.) and Columbia University (D.M.A.). Among his important teachers were Leonard Bernstein (composition and conducting), George Perle, Hugo Weisgall, Chou Wen-Chung, and Jack Beeson.</p>
        <p>"Give me five years. If I do not succeed as a musician, I will choose another profession." Bright Sheng made this promise to his father the year after his arrival in the United States, at a time when his father was pushing him to change his mind from music to business. His father had warned him that, "music will never make you a good living." Bright Sheng's talent, however, emerged of its own accord soon after he had given his word to his father. In addition to the awards he received in China and Europe, Sheng also received a number of prizes in the United States already as a student: from the National Endowment for the Arts; American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters; the Guggenheim, Rockefeller, Naumberg, Jerome, Koussevitzky, and Copland foundations; the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust; the Kennedy Center; and Tanglewood Music Center.</p>
        <p>In 2001, Sheng was the recipient of the Michigan Arts Award and a Rackham fellowship from the University of Michigan. He has been a member of the composition faculty at the University of Michigan since 1995, and now holds the title of Leonard Bernstein Distinguished University Professor of Music. In April 1999, at the invitation of President William Clinton, Sheng received a special commission from the White House to create a new work for a state dinner. The resulting <title render="italic">Three Songs for Pipa and Cello</title> was premiered by soloists Wu Man and Yo Yo Ma during a dinner hosted by the president at which the Chinese Premiere, Zhou Rongji, was honored. Of all of Sheng's awards, the most significant is the so-called "Genius Award" -- the MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. Awarded in November 2001 with a cash prize of $500,000, Sheng was proclaimed by the Foundation Committee to be "an innovative composer who merges diverse musical customs in works that transcend conventional aesthetic boundaries." His music was further described as "a fresh voice in cross-cultural music." The foundation committee anticipated that "Bright Sheng will continue to be an important leader in exploring and bridging musical traditions."</p>
        <p>Inspired by the folk music of China, Bright Sheng's music is noted for its lyrical, limpid melodies, particularly from Qinghai; a Shostakovich sense of breath in the music phrases; a Bartokian sense of rhythmic propulsion; and musical and theatrical gestures borrowed or derived from Chinese opera. Sheng's works are also well known for their dramatic style and historical signification. Two of his major orchestral works were indeed inspired by events in recent Chinese history. They are <title render="italic">H'un: In Memoriam 1966-76</title> and <title render="italic">Naking! Nanking!</title>, a work for pipa and orchestra honoring those who endured the atrocities of the Rape of Nanjing.</p>
        <p>Within the first week of the new century, Bright Sheng had two world premieres. One was <title render="italic">Naking! Nanking</title> commissioned and premiered on January 2, 2000 by the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra in Hamburg, and conducted by Christoph Eschenbach. The other was <title render="italic">Red Silk Dance</title>, a piano concerto premiered on January 6, 2000 by the commissioning Boston Symphony Orchestra in Hamburg, with the soloist Emanuel Ax and conductor Robert Spano. Around the same time, there were major performances of Sheng's instrumental music. These included the world premiere of <title render="italic">Tibetan Dance</title> (2001) by the Verdehr Trio; the New York premieres of <title render="italic">Red Silk Dance</title> (Ax, Masur, New York Philharmonic); <title render="italic">Naking! Naking!</title> (Spano, Brooklyn Philharmonic); <title render="italic">Flute Moon</title> (Schwarz, New York Chamber Symphony); <title render="italic">China Dreams</title> (Spano, Saint Louis Symphony); and Leonard Slakin's presentation of <title render="italic">H'un</title> with the National Symphony in Washington, D.C. <title render="italic">H'un</title> had been commissioned and premiered in 1988 by the New York Chamber Symphony. This frequently performed piece, of "naked emotionalism ...a battle of the spirit" according to <title render="italic">The New York Times</title>, is Sheng's landmark portrait of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. It established his reputation as a composer and has been performed by major orchestras around the world, including the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, and Tokyo Philharmonic. Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic performed <title render="italic">H'un</title> in six cities on their 1993 European tour; in 1994, it was also featured at the Warsaw Autumn Festival.</p>
        <p>In 2002, Spano led the world premiere performance, with the Brooklyn Philharmonic, of Sheng's spirited <title render="italic">Tibetan Swing</title>, a ten-minute concert opener based upon a Tibetan dance rhythm and co-commissioned by the Singapore Symphony; the Dortmund Philharmonic performed <title render="italic">Naking! Naking!</title> under the direction of Arthur Fagen, the city's general music director; Hugh Wolf conducted <title render="italic">Postcards</title> with Frankfurt's Radio-Symfonie-Orchester; and the Dusseldof Symphony, conducted by John Fiore, gave the European premiere of <title render="italic">Tibetan Swing.</title> The Liverpool Philharmonic, under the guidance of its music director Gerard Schwarz, one of the composer's first champions in the West, offered concerts of Sheng's chamber music as well as performances of <title render="italic">H'un</title>. In March 2003, Carnegie Hall presented a Sheng Portrait concert in their "Making Music" series with members of the New York Philharmonic; and the New York Philharmonic, featuring soloists Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax conducted by David Zinman, premiered a major commission by Sheng: a quadruple concerto for cello, piano, pipa, and sheng entitled the <title render="italic">Silk Road Region in the Summer of 2000.</title></p>
        <p>In early February 2004, Bright Sheng enjoyed another world premiere, as Gerard Schewarz led soprano Jane Eaglen and the Seattle Symphony in the first performance of the orchestral song-cycle <title render="italic">The Phoenix</title>. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's mythical bird with Sheng's own English lyric adaptation, <title render="italic">The Phoenix</title> was co-commissioned by the Danish Radio Orchestra for the coinciding occasions of the Seattle Symphony's centennial celebration and for the bicentennial birthday of Andersen. In April 2004, the Seattle Symphony and Eaglen brought the work to Carnegie Hall for its New York premiere. Other firsts of Sheng around this time include the ISCM World Music Days 2003 presenting the Slovenian premiere of his <title render="italic">Concertino</title> <title render="italic">for Clarinet and String Quartet</title> by soloist Mate Bekavac and the Tartini String Quartet; Orchestra Luxembourg's national premiere of <title render="italic">Flute Moon</title>; the world premiere of his new choral work for young voice, <title render="italic">The Boatmen's Song</title>, performed by the Young People's Chorus of New York City in April 2004; and the Asian premiere of his quadruple concerto <title render="italic">The Song and Dance of Tears</title>  by The Silk Road Ensemble (featuring Yo-Yo Ma) and the Singapore Symphony in June 2004.</p>
        <p>Bright Sheng's compositional gifts have also shown him to be a natural for the theater. In July 2003, the Santa Fe Opera presented the world premiere of <title render="italic">Madam Mao.</title> This two-act opera portrays Jiang Qing, Chairman Mao's repressed, vengeful wife who was one of the leading architects of the disastrous Cultural Revolution that nearly destroyed China. Set to a libretto by its stage director Colin Graham, the work garnered worldwide acclaim. Heidi Waleson of <title render="italic">The Wall Street Journal</title> wrote that, "The opera begins and ends with the body of Jiang, who hanged herself in prison, dangling from the roof; in between, Mr. Sheng offers us an artist's insight and understanding of that startling image. She adds that, "Stylistically, Sheng is a master of fusion." Deborah Baker from <title render="italic">The Daily Camera.com</title> wrote that, "Sheng's writing for the voice is quite beguiling, with ruminative duets with wistful melodies, cushioned by subdued orchestral music that finds common ground between wide-space Coplandesque harmony and the pentatonic elements of Chinese idioms. The orchestra writing is brilliant." Said Anthony Tommasini, <title render="italic">The New Yotk Times</title>, "Sheng's [style] is an exquisite blend of the musical East and West." Mark Swed, <title render="italic">Los Angeles Times</title>, observed that, "Every aspect of this production was magnificent. No scene is too long, and there is plenty of contrast between violence and warm lyricism. Sheng's music is eclectic and the scoring is imaginative." Michael Kennedy, <title render="italic">the Telegraph</title> (London), called it "...extraordinary music and a riveting evening in the theater."</p>
        <p>Sheng's important works for the theater have extended to dance. In 2002, choreographer Helgi Tomasson compiled for the San Francisco Ballet three of Sheng's extant pieces as a new work entitled <title render="italic">Chi-Lin</title>. (The title refers to the unicorn, one of the four mythical beasts in Chinese mythology). Sheng conducted the premiere of <title render="italic">Chi-Lin</title>, as well as the company's tour performances in New York City. <title render="italic">Chi-Lin</title> was also presented at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. by the troupe. At the North Carolina Dance Theater, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux choreographed Sheng's <title render="italic">Four Movements for Piano Trio</title> as the work <title render="italic">Zoomin'</title>.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2000, the Spoleto USA Festival unveiled one of Bright Sheng's most important recent works: a multi-cultural music theater piece entitled <title render="italic">The Silver River</title> (1997; rev. 2000). Based on an ancient Chinese tale about star-crossed lovers, and set to a libretto by David Henry Hwang, this visually stunning production was directed by Ong Keng Sen, the Singaporean director well-known for a creative fusion of diverse Asian theatrical genres. <title render="italic">The Silver River</title> has been performed subsequently in Philadelphia at the Prince Music Theatre Festival; in Singapore; and in July 2002 it was a highlight of the Lincoln Center Festival in New York, where it was accompanied by concerts of, and symposia on, Sheng's music.</p>
        <p>While serving as composer-in-residence for the Lyric Opera of Chicago from 1989 to 1992, Sheng wrote <title render="italic">The Song of Majnun</title> (1992) -- a one act "Persian <title render="italic">Romeo and Juliet</title>" -- in collaboration with librettist Andrew Porter. <title render="italic">Majnun</title> has subsequently received five other productions nationwide and was recorded by the Houston Grand Opera on the Delos label. Sheng's musical passion will also soon materialize as a Broadway show. He is currently working on a Broadway show to be based on one of China's four famous stories, <title render="italic">The West Journey</title>.</p>
