      <p>The Sunderland and Safford families have been an influential presence in Michigan history. The Safford family came to Michigan from the East Coast in the first half of the nineteenth century, and have deep roots in the Plymouth/Canton Township area. Several Safford cousins enlisted in the Michigan 24th Infantry during the Civil War; the collection includes the letters of Winfield Scott Safford to his brother Robert Crawford Safford. (Winfield Scott Safford was killed in action at Gettysburg, July 1st, 1863.) The Sunderlands, meanwhile, first came to Ann Arbor in 1878, as a result of the pastorate of prominent Unitarian Minister Jabez T. Sunderland (1846-1936). (Sunderland was pastor of the First Unitarian Church in Ann Arbor from 1878 to 1898.) During that period, the Sunderland's eldest daughter Gertrude (1873-1967) met Robert Crawford Safford's son, Homer Erwin Safford (1869-1933). Homer Safford and Gertrude Sunderland married in 1898.</p>
      <p>This collection is comprised primarily of the papers of Homer E. and Gertrude S. Safford, their daughters Mildred H. Safford (1901-) and Helen Safford Toohy (1899-1997), and of Homer Safford's sister, Ada Murray Safford (1877-1951). Many of the Saffords and Sunderlands (and Sunderland Saffords) have connections to the University of Michigan: Gertrude Sunderland Safford received an AB in 1895, Homer E. Safford a PhB in 1892 and an MD in 1896, and Homer Safford's sister, Ada Murray Safford, attended UM from 1896 to 1900. Homer E. and Gertrude S. Safford's daughters Mildred H. Safford and Helen Safford (later Toohy) both received their AB degrees in 1923. Also, Truman Sunderland Safford attended UM with his sisters Mildred and Helen during 1920-1921, before moving on to Antioch College with Mildred. Finally, Clifford M. Toohy (Helen Safford Toohy's husband) attended Michigan for an AB in 1917 and for his law degree in 1920. Moreover, Gertrude's mother, Eliza Jane Read Sunderland (1839-1910), and siblings, Edson Sunderland (1874-1959) and Florence Sunderland (?-1925), received degrees from the University.</p>
      <p>Gertrude Sunderland Safford was born in Northfield Massachusetts, but left in 1878 when the Sunderlands moved to Ann Arbor. Before her marriage, she studied under John Dewey at the University of Michigan, as did her mother. After graduation from the University, Gertrude Sunderland followed Dewey to Chicago, where she worked in his experimental school. After marrying Homer E. Safford, Sunderland Safford settled in Detroit. Following in her mother's distinguished footsteps, Sunderland Safford was also a prominent figure in women's activism. In addition to tenures in executive positions in several women's clubs in the first half of the Twentieth Century, Sunderland Safford also served as the founding president of the Wayne County League of Women Voters (an outgrowth of the Detroit League of Women Voters) in 1924. Continuing her interest in education, Sunderland Safford was the first female board member of the Merrill-Palmer School, a position she held for over forty years.</p>
      <p>After marriage, Homer E. Safford was a general practitioner in Detroit. Among his works were efforts to reform the Detroit medical system, including a fact-finding tour with Dr. William Metcalf to European and U.S. hospitals as part of a project to plan the new Detroit General Hospital. (This project eventually became the Henry Ford Hospital, after Ford took over the project and threw out the original designs.) Safford left his practice to volunteer for the Army Medical Corps during World War I at Fort Leavenworth, where he served in the neuro-psychiatric division studying 'maladjusted' soldiers. (Among other topics, his letters home refer to the influenza epidemic of that time period.) Safford's experiences during WWI led him into psychiatry. Homer Safford's later work focused on helping 'problem children', especially in the Highland Park school system.</p>
      <p>Safford's sister, Ada Murray Safford, was one of Detroit's first public health nurses. She was also an avid genealogist, and compiled historical information and genealogical charts on the Murray and Safford families reaching back to their pre-colonial pasts in England.</p>
      <p>The collection also touches on the lives of Homer E. and Gertrude S. Safford's four children. Their eldest daughter, Helen Sunderland Safford, married Clifford M. Toohy (1895-1951), a Detroit attorney. Mildred H. Safford worked for many years at the Detroit Children's Museum, eventually becoming Assistant Director. The collection is much sparser on the lives of Truman Sunderland Safford (1903-), a lawyer, and of the Sunderland Saffords' youngest daughter, Virginia Safford Arnold (1908-).</p>

      <p>The Safford Sunderland Family collection consists of the papers of Gertrude Sunderland Safford, her husband Homer E. Safford, his sister Ada M. Safford, and of two of the Sunderland Saffords' daughters, Helen Safford Toohy and Mildred H. Safford. The papers also contain information on and materials from Gertrude Sunderland Safford's parents, Jabez T. Sunderland and Eliza Jane Read Sunderland; her siblings, Edson Read Sunderland and Florence Sunderland; and the Sunderland Saffords' other two children, Truman Sunderland Safford and Virginia Safford Arnold. Additionally, there is some material from and on Helen Safford Toohy's husband (Clifford M. Toohy) and daughters (Janet Toohy Ferguson and Phyllis Toohy). Finally, the collection contains Ada Murray Safford's extensive genealogical materials on the Murray and Safford families.</p>
      <p>The papers are organized into six series arranged by family member: Photographs, Gertrude Sunderland Safford, Homer Erwin Safford, Ada Murray Safford, Mildred Hortense Safford, and Helen Safford Toohy.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series (1826-1985) contains photos of several generations of Sunderlands and Saffords. In addition to formal portraits, there are numerous casual images of family gatherings and vacations. Other subjects include Detroit, Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan Campus, family homesteads in Canton Township and Grand Haven, and Mildred H. Safford's photo scrapbook of a European tour. Some of the earliest materials in the series are represented by tintypes and glass plate negatives, as well as by original photographs on cardstock and by reprints on modern photo paper.</p>

          <p>In addition to extensive family correspondence, the Gertrude Sunderland Safford (1880s-1969) series contains records of Sunderland Safford's involvement with women's clubs, the League of Women Voters, and the Merrill-Parker School. The series also contains records documenting Sunderland Safford's interest in music and diaries of trips to Europe and from her time in Chicago working under John Dewey. Sunderland Safford corresponded quite frequently with her parents, siblings, and children (when they were away); the incoming half of these exchanges are well represented in this series. Of special interest are letters documenting the growth of her children (from the Sunderlands' joy at their births to the children's' letters home from college), Homer Safford's trips away from home (including his tours of European, U.S., and Canadian hospitals and his WWI service), and her father's ongoing involvement with the Unitarian Church and his 1913-1914 trip to Japan and India. The series also includes correspondence addressed to the Sunderland Safford children while they lived at home.</p>

          <p>Above all, the Homer Erwin Safford (1843-1982) series documents Safford's medical career. This includes his general practice in the 1900s, his work on efforts to build a new hospital in Detroit before WWI, his service in the Army Medical Corps during the War, and his later work as a psychiatric consultant for the Highland Park school system, the Children's Aid Society, various juvenile court systems, and others. Much of these papers are in the form of diaries, correspondence, and clippings on Safford's accomplishments. The series also contains Safford's personal correspondence from family and friends. This includes letters from Gertrude Sunderland Safford both before their marriage and while he was away, and letters from his children. Letters addressed to both parents are included in the Gertrude Sunderland Safford series; because these two series include the children's letters home from while they were away at college, the family correspondence in them is especially rich in documenting student life during the 1920s. Finally, the series includes papers on Safford family history, including ante-bellum and Civil War correspondence.</p>

          <p>The Ada Murray Safford (1890s-1951) series revolves around her significant interest in family history. Records on her career as a public health nurse are dwarfed by correspondence from her 'immediate family' of Sunderland Saffords. These letters, in turn, are outweighed by her extensive correspondence from members of the extended Murray and Safford families on genealogical matters.</p>

          <p>Like the other series in the collection, the Mildred Hortense Safford (1903-1987) series is strong on family correspondence, especially for 1918-1925. (This series includes not only correspondence to Mildred Safford, but also correspondence addressed to both Helen and Mildred Safford from during the time when they were at UM together.) Later correspondence includes letters from life-long friends Safford made with sorority sisters and from coworkers at the Detroit Children's Museum. (Some of the sorority sisters' letters to Safford are addressed to 'Peter', a sorority nickname of hers.) The series also documents Safford's distinguished career at the Detroit Children's Museum and her involvement with the Detroit Women's City Club.</p>

Additionally, the series contains Safford Toohy's diaries documenting her troubled home life with her husband. Finally, the series contains some papers belonging to Clifford Toohy, as well as the letters he received from Helen Safford before their marriage, and letters from various Sunderlands and Saffords to the Safford Toohys' daughter, Janet Toohy, during her first year at Antioch College.</p>
