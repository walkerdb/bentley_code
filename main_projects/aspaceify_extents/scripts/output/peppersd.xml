    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Samuel DeWitt Pepper was born on December 27, 1877 at Middlesex, Ontario, Canada. One of ten children, he grew up in Forest, Ontario, and received his early education at local schools. He was in the first graduating class at London Normal School in 1900, and also took private instruction in advanced academic subjects during the 1890s.</p>
      <p>He was married to Katherine M. MacDonald in 1907, and they had two children - Elizabeth Marion (b. 1910) and Robert Hatfield (b. 1918).</p>
      <p>He moved to Port Huron, Michigan in 1903, and studied law while working at the law office of Burt D. Cady; he also took courses at the University of Michigan Law Department during the summer of 1905. Pepper passed the Michigan State Bar in 1906 and practiced law in Port Huron until his appointment as Assistant Attorney General in Lansing in 1912.</p>
      <p>Samuel Pepper's military career progressed concurrently with his work in law. He enlisted in the Michigan National Guard (MNG) in April 1905 and by September 1908 he achieved the rank of Second Lieutenant. In 1912, as part of an investigation into MNG members' behavior during a prison riot, Pepper was appointed Judge Advocate General of the MNG. This was the first of many times that he was to deal with the legal ramifications of civilian/military confrontations.</p>
      <p>Following a copper strike in northern Michigan, in which the MNG was used to avert violence between company owners and strikers, Pepper wrote Michigan National Guard When Used in Aid of Civil Authorities; this was printed and issued as a legal guide for MNG officers. Pepper also served on the Mexican border (1916-17) and saw active service in France during the First World War, where he received a Distinguished Service Medal. As Judge Advocate of the Fifth Army Corps, he presided over General Courts Martial for the Army of Occupation.</p>
      <p>After his discharge, Pepper returned to work in the Michigan Attorney General's office. He wrote the Michigan Insurance Code and was appointed to the state's Public Utilities Commission by his friend, Governor Alex Groesbeck. When Groesbeck left office in 1928, Pepper returned to private law practice in Port Huron. He remained active in Republican Party politics and the MNG.</p>
      <p>As Judge Advocate General of the Michigan National Guard, Pepper played a key advisory role to both MNG and state government officials when riots and labor unrest occurred in Michigan during the 1930s. Over the course of the Flint sit-down strike in 1937, he counselled caution and restraint in the deployment of National Guardsmen. After retiring from the MNG in December 1941, Pepper was appointed Chief Deputy State Director of the Selective Service System for the duration of World War II.</p>
      <p>After the war, Pepper returned once again to his law practice, was City Attorney of Port Huron, and became General Counsel of Michigan Life Insurance Company; he also took active part in revising Michigan state military laws in the early 1950s. Samuel Pepper died in Port Huron in 1960.</p>

      <p>The Samuel D. Pepper papers cover Pepper's military service and legal career, as well as his relationships with family and friends. The collection provides particularly strong documentation of the impact which Pepper's Michigan National Guard (MNG) service had on personal and professional aspects of his life. The papers are divided into four main series: Personal, Military Activities, Professional and Political Activities, and Photographs.</p>

          <p>The Personal series spans the dates 1893-1952. It includes a short unpublished biography of Pepper by collection donor Winston Wessels, written in 1963, which details his legal and military careers, as well as two autobiographical letters by Pepper, written in 1920 and 1952. The bulk of this series is made up of correspondence with family and friends in the United States and Canada. The letters provide a glimpse into relations between members of Pepper's extended family and details of daily life in pre-World War I Canada. These include discussions of current events and politics, particularly between 1900 and 1920. Letters from A.M. Dallas and Miles Pepper provide first-hand accounts of life in western Canada during the "boom" early in the century. The Pepper family genealogy by M.G. Reddon may be of use in determining family relationships.</p>
          <p>Samuel Pepper and his wife Katherine wrote to each other almost daily while he was serving in France (1918-1919) and this correspondence tells a great deal about the war as each of them experienced it. Other letters which describe war experiences are Robert Pepper's letters home from the Pacific in World War II; Samuel Pepper's correspondence with "war buddy" John LeFevre; and letters from a French acquaintance, Margaret Philbert. The latter contain vivid descriptions of life in France immediately following the Second World War. The A-Z folder contains letters to Pepper from Attorney General Grant Fellows and Alex Groesbeck written to Pepper while he was at the front in World War I.</p>

          <p>The Military Activities series covers Pepper's military career from 1908 to 1952. Pepper's MNG papers are arranged chronologically and include general administrative records as well as Pepper's accounts of his military service. There are local newspapers and investigation transcripts from the 1913 copper strike, and the 1912-14 Judge Advocate General folder also contains correspondence relating to the strike. A manuscript account of Armistice Day at the front and a journal which Pepper kept on his return trip from France describe his thoughts about the war, as well as his views on military discipline. He also kept daily diaries of his experiences during service on the Mexican border and in France.</p>
          <p>MNG files from the 1920s and 1930s contain memos and correspondence regarding plans for training camps, regulations, Camp Grayling Bulletins, and reports, essays, and speeches by Pepper. MNG records from 1935 and 1937 relate to riots in Flint and to the sit-down strike; these include essays by Pepper on military responses to civil unrest. The Veterans' Groups subseries covers fundraising, memorial events, and social activities during the 1920s and 1930s.</p>

          <p>The Professional and Political Activities series spans the period 1910 to 1953. Pepper's law practice, government service and Republican Party work tended to overlap, and this is evident in the correspondence files, which are arranged alphabetically. Many letters are requests for Pepper's help in obtaining jobs with the state government. Representative samples have been retained from the Attorney General's office correspondence, as have letters and legal briefs from the Michigan Life Insurance Company. The Republican Party folders includes essays, speeches and correspondence by Pepper which outline his active participation in intra-party politics and strategic planning in the 1920 and 1924 elections.</p>

          <p>Photographs have been divided into two folders; family pictures cover the years between about 1900 and the 1930s, while the military photographs run from roughly 1913 with a view of Calumet during the copper mining strike to 1943. The collection includes military pictures from the Mexican border and from the front in France, as well as photographs of Camp Grayling, the MNG training camp.</p>
