    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Mike Wallace was born May 9, 1918 in Brookline, Massachusetts the son of Russian Jewish immigrants as Myron Leon Wallace. He graduated from high school in 1935 then attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor where he also worked as an announcer at the university radio division. After receiving his degree in 1939 he began his broadcasting career first in Grand Rapids, Mich. at WOOD-WASH radio station, and then at Detroit's WXYZ, where his work included newscasting as well as narration on <title render="italic">The Green Hornet</title>. In 1941 he was hired by the <title render="italic">Chicago Sun's</title> radio station as a newscaster, but his career was interrupted in 1943 by wartime service in the United States Navy.</p>
      <p>In 1946 Wallace was discharged from the service and returned to Chicago. He worked on a variety of interview, news, and entertainment programs. In 1949 he teamed up with his actress-wife, Buff Cobb, in a local radio interview program. In 1951 the pair were put under contract by CBS, moved to New York City, and began a television interview series called <title render="italic">Mike and Buff</title>. Marked by frequent staged disagreements between the hosts, the show was a departure from the sugary banter of other husband and wife programs. The show ended in 1954 with the Wallaces' divorce.</p>
      <p>Late in 1955 Wallace was hired as news anchor by WABD in New York. In October, 1956 WABD news director Ted Yates replaced the 11 o'clock news with <title render="italic">Night Beat</title>. Hosted by Wallace, the hour-long news and interview show featured a darkened set, piercing questions, and the use of prolonged close-ups that gave the show the feel of an interrogation. The sensation created by this show led ABC to pick it up in April, 1957. Renamed <title render="italic">The Mike Wallace Interview</title>, it ran only once a week for one-half hour. After losing its sponsor in 1958 the controversial show was picked up for a 19-week run by the Fund for the Republic as <title render="italic">Survival and Freedom</title>. Also during these years, Wallace began writing a daily interview column for the <title render="italic">New York Post</title> called "Mike Wallace Asks."</p>
      <p>After his series at ABC ended in September 1958 Wallace worked briefly with Ted Yates as co-producer of another ABC interview show hosted by author Ben Hecht. In February 1959 Wallace and Yates were hired by New York's WNTA to anchor <title render="italic">News Beat</title>, New York's first one-half hour newscast, and to revive <title render="italic">The Mike Wallace Interview</title>. Though it ran for two years and was nationally syndicated, it was not as successful as its predecessor.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 1960 Wallace also did some work for the Westinghouse Network as co-anchor of its political convention coverage. When he left WNTA, he joined Westinghouse full time as co-host of <title render="italic">P.M. East</title>, a talk show which began in June, 1961. In February, 1963 Wallace was hired by CBS News. There he anchored the CBS Morning News, worked as a correspondent, and in 1968 began his ongoing work as one of the reporters of the popular series <title render="italic">60 Minutes</title>. Wallace continued to work on the show until 2006 leading it to the unprecedented rate of 23 seasons on the Nielsen annual top 10 list -- five seasons as the number-one program.</p>
      <p>Throughout his career, Wallace has been the recipient of numerous broadcasting awards and honors. Among his prestigious awards are twenty one Emmy Awards, including a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Emmy (2003), the 2002 Fred Friendly First Amendment Award for journalistic contributions to free speech, five DuPont-Columbia Journalism Awards, five John Foster Peabody Awards, the Paul White Award (1991), a Robert E. Sherwood Award, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award grand prize and Television first prize (1996), among others. In June of 1991 he was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. In 1993 he was named the Broadcaster of the Year by the International Radio and Television Society. Part of his rich legacy includes the Knight-Wallace Fellowship and Mike and Mary Wallace House at the University of Michigan. Wallace's donations support this in-residence study program begun in 1994 for professional journalists seeking to improve their knowledge in a desired field or issue.</p>
      <p>Wallace was elected a fellow of the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi (November 1975) and was awarded a doctorate in humane letters, honoris causa, from the University of Massachusetts (1978). In May 1987 he received an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Michigan and, in 1989 an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Mike Wallace died at his home in Canaan, CT on April 7, 2012 at age 93.</p>

          <p>The Television and Newspaper Career, 1956-1963 series comprises the bulk of the collection. It is arranged chronologically according to program or column. There are eight principal subseries: <title render="italic">Night Beat</title> <title render="italic">New York Post</title> Column, Newsmaker Productions, <title render="italic">Mike Wallace Interview</title> <title render="italic">Survival and Freedom</title> <title render="italic">Ben Hecht Show</title> WNTA <title render="italic">Mike Wallace Interview</title> and Miscellaneous.</p>
          <p>The subseries that deal with television interview programs are arranged similarly. These series begin with administrative or miscellaneous folders containing clippings, fan mail, press releases, and other materials pertaining to that show. The remainder of the folders are then arranged alphabetically by the name of the guest or topic. Each of these alphabetical folders includes a transcript of the show. Many folders also contain research materials on the guest, an assignment sheet, correspondence with guest, and viewer mail.</p>
          <p>The <title render="italic">New York Post</title> Column subseries also begins with a miscellaneous folder and is arranged alphabetically according to guest. However, the materials within each folder are different from the television series. Each folder begins with a two or three page sheet called "The Angle,'' outlining the major elements to be covered in the column. This is followed by a series of possible questions, an unedited text of the interview, and several drafts of edited texts. Also included are copies of the actual column, correspondence with the interviewee, and in many cases, research and background material on the interviewee.</p>
