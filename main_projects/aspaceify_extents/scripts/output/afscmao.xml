      <p>The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) was established in 1917 during World War I as an outreach program of the Quakers, offering humanitarian aid to the war's victims. From the beginning, there has been a strong vein of dissent in Quaker outreach activities, protesting against abuse while caring for those who suffer.</p>
      <p>In 1960, the Michigan Area Office (MAO) of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) came into being in response to a concern from Friends in Michigan to expand AFSC programs beyond the volunteer youth service activities which had been going on in the 1950s. From the outset, the MAO sought to serve as many Michigan communities as possible through its peace education and youth service programs and projects. In 1972, the Michigan Area Executive Committee (MAEC), in conjunction with staff, developed a plan to establish a Western Michigan Program Office, and in 1975 the MAEC founded the Detroit Program Office.</p>
      <p>As of the 1970-1971 fiscal year, the MAO was made up of an executive committee, community relations committee, and peace education committee. The executive committee was responsible for making major policy decisions and providing overall leadership and review for programs in Michigan. The community relations committee and the peace education committee provided leadership and oversight for the programs within their respective domains.</p>
      <p>While the basic structure remained the same, the Michigan Area Office did undergo a few organizational changes since that time. In 1977, a restructuring subcommittee of the MAO clarified the position of the MAEC and changed the Michigan Area Program Secretary's title to Michigan Area Executive Secretary. (It appears the Michigan Area Executive Committee was previously known as the Michigan Area Program Committee.) This subcommittee also stated that the program committees--peace education and community relations--were responsible for defining policy areas, developing programming methods, identifying resources needed, and presenting these to the MAEC. Besides the two program committees, the MAEC was supported by personnel and nominating committees.</p>
      <p>Apparently the Michigan Area Executive Committee went through another name change or restructuring, since a later organizational chart shows the MAO as headed by a committee called the Michigan Area Coordinating Committee (MACC). This chart, which appears to be from the mid-1980s, indicates that the MACC was supported by the same four subordinate committees mentioned previously in relation to the MAEC.</p>
      <p>Although the Michigan Area Office was originally subordinate to the Dayton Regional Office (DRO), the DRO and the Midwest Regional Office merged in 1985 to create the Great Lakes Regional Office. An organizational chart shows that Dayton became the seat of an area office, which, with the MAO and the Chicago Area Office, was subordinate to the new Great Lakes Regional Office. The national office, which oversees nine regional offices, is based in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>According to a 1986 statement, the mission of the American Friends Service Committee is "to help express the historic Peace Testimony of Friends and Friends' commitments to equality, simplicity, peace and justice. These are founded in Friends' belief that every person possesses that of God within herself or himself, and is a person of worth and dignity." The Michigan Area Office of the AFSC employed a small staff and relied on many volunteers to carry out its programs. The MAO Peace Education Committee (MAPEC) was especially active in Middle Eastern issues, and was led in this work by staff members Joe Volk and Richard Cleaver. Barbara Cartwright and Marc Mauer led the MAO Community Relations Committee (MACRC), which focused its work on increasing equity in the criminal justice system (especially regarding bail). In the 1990s, the organization began working on issues relating to discrimination against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals.</p>

          <p>Since the executive committee and its successor, the coordinating committee, served as the overall policy and administrative unit for the MAO, the files in this series contain materials documenting--and often explaining--the overall functioning and policy development of the MAO. The minutes, extending from 1979 to 1988, document policy and management issues and decisions and are an important beginning to understanding the mission and work of the MAO. Minutes after 1988 were not maintained separately and thus are scattered throughout other record series.</p>

          <p>The Peace Education Committee series consists of two chronological subseries and three subseries of records maintained by PEC coordinators and secretaries. The great value of this series is its documentation of the issues of the time and the response of the MAO to these issues. Of special interest is the PEC's Middle East Peace Education program. The PEC was especially active in educating about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and seeking peaceful resolution to tensions arising from that situation. Included is a near-complete run of the newsletter, "Middle East Peace Notes," that runs from 1976 to 1987. The PEC also sponsored and arranged extensive lectures, conferences, and seminars regarding Middle Eastern issues. Speakers who participated in the lecture series included Jim Fine, Everett Mendelssohn, Mattityahu Peled, and Loren Tesdell. The subseries maintained by Coordinator/Peace Education Secretaries, Joe Volk, (1977-1982) Richard Cleaver (1982-1992), and Area Coordinator Jan Wright (1992-2002) also contain additional information about Peace in the Middle East and Militarism and Non-violence. One issue that came to the fore in the 1990s concerned protection of the rights of lesbian/gay/bisexual citizens. A significant portion of Jan Wright subseries relates to workshops and conferences on this topic sponsored by the organization.</p>

          <p>The Community Relations Committee series is of most value for its documentation of MAO's involvement in the topic of Criminal Justice, especially in such areas as bail and other pretrial issues, community-based corrections, the death penalty, prison alternatives, prison overcrowding, just treatment of prisoners, and positive reintegration of prisoners into society (the Options Center). Included in these materials are files of correspondence between AFSC staff and prisoners. This correspondence documents the MACRC's commitment to working with prisoners to ensure their equitable treatment within the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>The National and Regional series documents the MAO's relationship with the national office and with the regional office in Dayton, Ohio. The National Office files include background information, publications, and material relating to the 75th anniversary of AFSC. This celebration triggered the compilation of narrative sketches of the activities of local offices and of their programs. Issues examined in this series include: Youth and Militarism (continuing the anti-war theme from the 1960s and 1970s), Affirmative Action, and more recently, Gay/Lesbian topics. The Dayton Regional Office files consist mainly of memoranda, especially those to and from Leonard Tinker. In 1985, the Dayton Regional Office merged with the Midwest Regional Office to form the Great Lakes Region office headquartered in Dayton. The records designated as Great Lakes Region include minutes, annual meeting material and information about staff retreats. This series also includes some material from the Michigan and Northern Ohio Coordinating Committee.</p>

          <p>The MAO administrative series includes a chronological subseries dating from 1956 to 1987. These files consist of miscellaneous reports, memoranda, and published material not easily associated with other series. Other files concern the deliberations of the personnel committee. Researchers may find the personnel files of the Michigan Area Office especially helpful; staff members periodically evaluated MAO programs, and these evaluations were included in the personnel files. There are also mailings files which are a helpful complement to other sets of records, especially as they often contain minutes and staff reports.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series relate to miscellaneous topics of concern both locally and nationally, primarily in the 1960s and 1970s. There is, for example, some materials relating to the MAO's participation in the Del Monte Boycott of 1977, in the Detroit Anti-Hunger Program of 1976-1977, and in the Telephone Tax Resistance movement in 1970. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, MAO was active in draft counseling activities. Included in this series is correspondence of the organization with young men in Michigan concerning the draft and conscientious objection to war. The letters reflect the thinking of a large number of American youth who were apprehensive about the war in Vietnam and who sought to resist the draft or to find alternative service.</p>

          <p>Audio-Visual Materials series includes a scattering of photos and some audio-cassettes. The Photographs include black and white contact prints documenting many conferences in the early 1980s; descriptive lists accompany the sheets. The next folder contains many black and white photographs and contact prints documenting the Royal Oak Township Weekend Workcamp of April 1964. These photographs are unidentified otherwise. The final folder contains undated black and white photographs taken at the Washtenaw County Jail. The audio cassettes relate to the issue of racism and homophobia.</p>
