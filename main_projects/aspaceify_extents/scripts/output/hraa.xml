      <abstract>The Personnel Office of the University of Michigan was founded in 1945. This office dealt with the development and implementation of personnel policies and issues of hiring, firing, promotion, tenure, sabbatical leaves, remuneration, and contract negotiations. The records of this office are generally closed for thirty years after their creation. The Affirmative Action Office was created in 1972 to monitor the university's enforcement of federal and state affirmative action legislation such as equal employment opportunity, Title IX, age discrimination in employment act, etc and reporting the university's compliance to the federal and state governments. This office was also responsible for ensuring fair and equitable hiring practices within the university. In February 1994, the two offices were united and reorganized to form the Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action.</abstract>

      <p>The University of Michigan Personnel Office was established in 1945 to develop and implement personnel policies, administer faculty promotion and tenure-granting policies, and negotiate and monitor contracts with unionized university employees. While recommendations for faculty promotions and tenure began in the department, school, or college, the Personnel Office was responsible for conducting them to the president, the provost, and to the Board of Regents for final action. This office also maintained the official employment record for all university faculty and staff. The Personnel Office annually published salary information of all university employees. Researchers will find these listings in the University of Michigan Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action publications group.</p>
      <p>In 1972 the University of Michigan created the Affirmative Action Program to develop recruiting practices and set goals and timetables to respond to federal laws passed in the 1960s guaranteeing equal opportunity in employment to women and minorities. The first director of the Affirmative Action Program was Nellie M. Varner. Her chief responsibility was to interpret the specific guidelines of the Department of Education (Title VI, Title IX), the Department of Labor (Title IV and Title VII) and to build a structure within the university to meet these guidelines. In addition she served as a liaison between the university, federal government officials, and the university's Commissions for Minority Affairs and Women, established by President Robben Fleming in 1971. His charge to the commissions was to examine university policies, procedures, and practices which might contribute to discrimination against minority groups and women, and make recommendations. The commissions and the Affirmative Action Program worked together to develop procedures and submitted recommendations to the president to improve various programs within the university.</p>
      <p>Reorganized in 1976 the Affirmative Action Program was changed to Affirmative Action Office and the Commissions for Minority Affairs and Women were integrated into the office. The move eliminated duplication of effort and focused activity on the eradication of discriminatory practices. Gwendolyn Baker was appointed the new director of the Affirmative Action Office. In 1978 Charles Allemand replaced her as director of the Affirmative Action Office.</p>
      <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, the role of the office grew to include the protection of handicapped individuals, people between the ages of 40 and 70, and veterans of the Vietnam War. In addition, non-discriminatory policies included religion, national origin, height, weight, marital status, and sexual orientation.</p>
      <p>In 1980 Virginia Nordby became director of the Affirmative Action Office. The office was divided into compliance and programs teams, reflecting the major functions of the office, to meet federal affirmative action guidelines, and to serve the needs of groups or individuals on campus protected by nondiscrimination laws. Nordby directed both teams.</p>
      <p>The compliance team was responsible for the data retrieval, analysis, and writing the reports on minority student recruitment and retention, faculty and staff employment, and affirmative action compliance required by the university and the federal government. In addition, it monitored the race and gender composition of the faculty, staff, and student body; set affirmative action goals and followed their progress, and oversaw faculty and staff recruitment. The program team addressed the needs of members of protected groups through grievance counseling, program development, and policy recommendations. It also provided workshops to the university community.</p>
      <p>The Affirmative Action Office also worked with constituency groups, providing direct staff and financial support to such groups as the Academic Women's Caucus, the African-American Organizations Coalition, the Age Concerns Council, the Association of Black Professionals and Administrators, the Commission for Women, the Women of Color Task Force, the Men of Color Task Force, the Task Force on Sexual Orientation, and the Women's Initiative Group.</p>
      <p>In 1988 Virginia Nordby left the Affirmative Action Office. Mary Ann Swain became the interim director. In 1989, Zaida I. Giraldo became the director. In 1992, Jimmy A. Myers took over the position as Interim Director.</p>
      <p>On February 15, 1994 the Affirmative Action Office combined with the Personnel Office to become the Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action. Jackie McClain was appointed as the executive director.</p>

          <p>The Affirmative Action records (11 linear feet) dating from 1964 to 2001, document the university's effort to comply with state and federal laws concerning both racial and sexual harassment, fair and equal employment opportunities, and handicap issues. These records are divided into five series: Topical Files; Federal Agencies and Regulations; Minorities; State of Michigan; and Women.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files series (1.2 linear feet) (1972-1996) includes correspondence from the office of Zaida Giraldo dating from 1989 to 1993 as well as an alphabetical administrative topical file. The bulk of this series describes grievance procedures and includes reports on harassment and discrimination, both racial and sexual, within the university from 1985 to 1995. Researchers will also find folders on topics such as family and dependent care, family housing, and the merger of the Affirmative Action Office and the Personnel Office in 1994.</p>

            <p>The Federal Agencies and Regulations series (3.4 linear feet) (1964-1989) includes folders describing the university's interaction with the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
            <p>The Federal Agencies and Regulations series (3.4 linear feet) (1964-1989) includes folders describing the university's interaction with the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
            <p>The Department of Education administered Title IX ensuring that female athletes would have equal opportunities to participate in sports, with equal coaching, and training facilities, The Title IX records, covering the period 1972 to 1987, include the compliance reviews conducted by the university, correspondence between Virginia Nordby, university officials, and federal commissioners, and the federal regulations which the university was following. These records describe the history of athletics at the University of Michigan, budgets for the various programs, expenditures for the teams, financial aid available for the athletes, and information regarding their eligibility. Because of student-identifiable information, many of these folders are restricted.</p>
            <p>The Department of Labor, through the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, directed that race and gender balances be established and maintained at the university, if federal funding through grants was to continue. These compliance reviews date from 1979 until 1988. They contain information about salaries, retention of current faculty and staff members, ways to increase the pool for under represented minorities and women, and selection criteria for newly hired personnel. Some of these records have been restricted.</p>
            <p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission oversaw the Age Discrimination Act and Equal Pay Acts. These records, covering the period from 1970-1989, document the university's role in insuring its employees fair treatment, including an undated paper written by Virginia Nordby interpreting the Equal Pay Act and Title VII legislation.</p>

            <p>The Affirmative Action Office worked closely with women's groups on campus. The Women series (3 linear feet) (1970-2001) documents that relationship with records of the Academic Women's Caucus, the Center for the Continuing Education of Women (later known as the Center for the Education of Women), the Commission for Women (CFW), and the Women's Information Group (WING). These records are arranged alphabetically. The Academic Women's Caucus (1974-2001) includes records documenting the process of awarding the Sarah Goddard Power Award including nominations from 1989 to 2001. There are also minutes for the period from 1982 to 1987, as well as copies of the reports <title render="italic">Report on the Status of Women</title> and <title render="italic">Status of Female Faculty</title>, both released in 1982. The CEW includes correspondence, minutes of meetings, and publications dating from 1979-1988. The Commission for Women (1980-1998) includes career guides, correspondence, minutes and agendas, and publications. The Women's Information Group (1983-1989) includes correspondence, minutes and agendas, and publications. There are also records documenting important women's issues in this series including child care, discrimination, the Equal Rights Amendment, rape prevention, and the status of women in graduate education.</p>

            <p>The Schools and Colleges series (6 linear feet) (1974-2000) documents specific questions regarding pay, promotions, reductions in service, medical, personal, and sabbatical leaves, gender, age, and racial discrimination, and sexual and racial harassment for the faculty and staff of the university from 1974 to 1999. For this reason, these records are restricted for thirty (30) years after creation. They are arranged alphabetically for the individual school and college. The general folders contain information about searches and sensitive issues such as harassment and discipline of individual employees. The faculty and staff folders also relate to individual university employees usually relating to hiring, promotions, and discrimination.</p>

            <p>The Compensation Manuals and Programs series (2.6 linear feet) (1972-1996) covers the period from 1971 to 1996 and includes compensation schedules, an alphabetical and numerical list of all university job classifications, and a alphabetical and numerical listing of the job departments. There are similar lists for temporary positions within the university. In 1974 they also broke out occupation groups. The merit salary incentive data was added to the notebooks in 1980. The Compensation Programs notebook covers the years from 1976 to 1988. It includes compensation changes by job family, average salaries by grade, salary schedules by grade and family, and compensation adjustments for both permanent and temporary employees. There are also classification descriptions and qualifications for temporary hires. In 1981-1982 there is a detailed description of the merit salary increase program.</p>

          <p>The Human Resources and Affirmative Action records include video tapes and DVD recordings (.8 linear feet) of the annual service awards presentation administered by the Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action. These VHS tapes and DVD recordings document the period from 1995 to 2004. They contain photographs of employees who have served the university for at least thirty years and more in increments of five years. Included with each video, from 1996 to the present, are printed programs listing those who have worked at the university for twenty years and more. There is also an undated VHS tape entitled <title render="italic">20 Years is...Celebrating Twenty Years of Service at the University of Michigan</title>.</p>
