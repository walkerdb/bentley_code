    <bioghist>
      <p>Thomas Francis, Jr., 1900-1969, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, 1941-1969, was best known for his work in the development of the influenza and poliomyelitis vaccinations. Educated at Allegheny College and Yale Medical School, Francis' work centered around the study of the causes of infectious disease, especially pneumonia, influenza, and poliomyelitis, and the development of serum treatments for these diseases.</p>
      <p>The Twentieth Century witnessed a revolution in the manner in which scientific research was accomplished. The solitary figure in an underequipped laboratory gradually gave way to the research team comprised of specialists, established to solve some particular scientific problem, and funded with grants from foundations or agencies of the government. By mid-century, individual discoveries were still being made, but more common was cooperative research, where scientists freely exchanged information and built upon the work of their peers. During the period of Thomas Francis, Jr.'s greatest work, there was now a sense that common life-threatening problems required an all-out team effort and that claims for the discovery were less important than the fact that discovery was made. Leading the way in changing the way epidemiological research was performed was Thomas Francis, Jr.</p>
      <p>Thomas Francis, Jr. was born July 15, 1900 in Gas City, Indiana, the son of Thomas and Elizabeth (Cadogan) Francis. He graduated with a B.S. from Allegheny College in 1921, then received his M.D. from Yale Medical School in 1925. After completing his residency at Yale, he went to the Rockefeller Institute Hospital where he worked in the Clinical Pneumonia Service under Rufus Cole and O.T. Avery. In 1936, he joined the staff of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation where he established study laboratories to work on the etiology and epidemiology of influenza. In 1938, he went to New York University College of Medicine as professor and chairman of the department of bacteriology.</p>
      <p>In 1941, Francis came to the University of Michigan where he served as professor and chairman of the department of epidemiology in the newly established School of Public Health and professor of epidemiology in the Medical School. In 1947, he was appointed Henry Sewell Professor of Epidemiology. Francis remained at the University of Michigan until his death on October 1, 1969.</p>
      <p>Francis' career centered around the study of the causes of infectious disease, especially pneumonia, influenza, and poliomyelitis, and the development of serum treatments for these scourges. While at the Rockefeller Foundation, Francis in his research on pneumonia created what he termed a "revolution in immunologic theory" when he demonstrated that antigens that produce antibodies were derived from polysaccharides of the pneumoccus. Prior to then, the accepted belief was that only proteins could function as antigens.</p>
      <p>In 1934, Francis isolated the human influenza virus confirming the work of Smith, Andrewes and Laidlaw in England. He subsequently was able to establish the virus in mice and tissue culture. In 1940, he identified and was able to isolate influenza virus, Type B. The importance of his research was widely recognized. In 1941, he was appointed Director of the Commission on Influenza of the Army Epidemiological Board (its name was later changed to the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board). Here he established "listening posts" for the detection of influenza and conducted studies giving evidence that vaccination is effective against the epidemic strains of influenza. First in 1943, he developed a polyvalent vaccine that proved to be highly effective against influenza A in military personnel. Then in 1945, he demonstrated the effectiveness of vaccination against influenza B.</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1940s, Francis and his colleagues undertook numerous studies pertaining to the epidemiology and immunology of poliomyelitis. The purpose of this work was to determine the virus' mode of entrance into a community and its spread thereafter. In 1954, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis selected Francis to head up the Poliomyelitis Vaccine Evaluation Center at the University of Michigan and to test the potency and effectiveness of the inactivated poliommyelitis vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. In what was until then the largest test of its kind, testing 1,800,000 children in forty-four states, Francis demonstrated the vaccine to be safe, potent and effective. On April 12, 1955, with Jonas Salk and Basil O'Connor of the National Foundation by his side, Francis announced to the world that a vaccine for paralytic polio had been found.</p>
      <p>Francis was the author of numerous articles and a book on viral and Rickettsial diseases. He was additionally the recipient of various professional awards. For most of his career Francis was generous with his time, serving on the boards of private research organizations, professional organizations, and national and international governmental committees and institutes. A partial listing only includes the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, the National Academy of Science, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Committee, the Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research, and the Vaccine Development Committee.</p>
      <p>Francis was a significant figure in the development and testing of vaccines to control the spread of two of the twentieth century's most devastating epidemical diseases - influenza and poliomyelitis. Interested in both theoretical and applied studies, Francis devoted his life to understanding the mechanisms of viral infections, and the development of means of resistance and prevention</p>

      <p>Important certainly for the study of influenza and poliomyelitis research, the Francis papers also document changes in the way scientific research, particularly medical research, was managed. In his correspondence files, the records from his work in combating influenza and poliomyelitis, and his participation in various professional societies, the researcher will find Francis interacting as a member of a scientific community, working with others, soliciting and exchanging views, and administering, when needed, vast programs of testing.</p>
      <p>The Thomas Francis, Jr. papers have been arranged into seven series: General; Correspondence; Poliomyelitis Vaccine Evaluation Center; Organizations; University of Michigan; Speeches, Articles, etc.; Topical Files; and Personal/Biographical. Specific topics covered in the collection are mentioned in the descriptions of individual series. In sum, the collection documents more thoroughly Francis' work since coming to the University of Michigan in 1941. Francis' fame rests upon his research and his heading-up of influenza and poliomyelitis testing programs. For some topics, use of the Francis papers will require of the researcher at least a basic level of knowledge of epidemiology or disease control. Other subjects, such as the administration of research projects and the ways in which information is transmitted within the scientific community are less specialized and capable of being understood by the informed layperson.</p>
      <p>Parts of the Francis papers have not yet been completely processed. Most of these subseries pertain to Francis' organizational commitments and to his membership on various boards and commissions. Types of records in these unprocessed subseries consist of minutes of meetings and procedural records. These unprocessed records are indicated on the finding aid along with the bulk size of the subseries.</p>

          <p>General Correspondence, 1933-1969 (13.5 linear feet). This series consists of eight dated subseries arranged alphabetically. The dates of the subseries vary in length and do not always correspond to either an academic or calendar year. The dating of the subseries are also not rigid as occasional letters from either an earlier or later subseries might be found. The arrangement of the files is alphabetical usually by an individual's name but sometimes by his/her organizational affiliation. Correspondents consist mostly of Francis' professional colleagues, students, members of the scientific community in general, and lay people who recognized Francis for his many contributions. Topics might be highly scientific or just pertaining to publications, conference meetings, or "keeping in touch" communications with his academic colleagues.</p>

          <p>Poliomyelitis Vaccine Evaluation Center, 1953-1957 (10.5 linear feet). Although received as part of the Thomas Francis accession, these are the administrative files of the PEC and as such they include files of those other individuals associated with the work of polio vaccine testing. In this category are lab consultant Herbert A. Wenner and members of the statistical division Robert B. Voight and John Napier. Crucial in importance is the subseries - Topical Files - which contains substantive and procedural information about the administration of the polio vaccine testing. Principal headings within this subseries relate to the PEC's relationship with the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, study lab files, and Jonas Salk materials. Smaller subseries detail activities of Francis and the PEC subsequent to the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine. These relate to matters of the production and allocation of the vaccine and may be found in the subseries, Technical Advisory Committee on Poliomyelitis and under Vaccine.</p>
          <p>Only a small portion of the actual patient testing files have come to the library. There are paper records for patients in the states of Texas through Wyoming only. The whereabouts of the remainder of the paper records is uncertain. The Francis collection does include microfilmed records of the entire project so perhaps the originals were discarded following the filming.</p>

          <p>The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board series is divided into two subseries; Presidents files and Commission on Influenza of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. The President's Files date from Francis' term as president of the board, 1958-1960. The Commission on Influenza records are in fact the official records of this agency. Established in 1941 with Francis as its head, the Commission on Influenza was headquartered within the School of Public Health. And when Francis stepped aside in 1955, his colleague Fred Davenport became director and served into the 1970s. The researcher interested in the work of the Commission and the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board should consult Davenport's papers at the library for related materials.</p>

          <p>Organizations, 1939-1969 (2 linear feet). The largest series in the collection, Organizations, is an amalgam of separate groupings of records pertaining to Thomas Francis' participation in professional, private, and governmental organizations and agencies. The size of the subseries vary considerably depending upon the level of his involvement and the period of time in which he was active. Where Francis was director or heavily involved, the amount of records is extensive, substantive, and important to any study of Francis' career. Where his participation was less direct, the organization files consist of professional exchanges, conferences and meetings, papers and publications, and advice and counsel sought and exchanged. The Organization series is arranged alphabetically by the name of the organization and thereafter topically.</p>
          <p>Among the most significant organizational files are those of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was a prime sponsor of Francis' work on the polio vaccine tests.</p>

          <p>University of Michigan, 1941-1969 (3 linear feet). This smaller series relates specifically to Francis' responsibilities as a member of the faculty of the University of Michigan. As a respected scientist and scholar, Francis was called upon to serve on such university-wide or cross-unit committees as the Cancer Research Institute Committee, the Mental Health Research Institute Advisory Committee, the Henry Russel Lecture Committee, and the Senate Advisory Committee. In addition, this series contains files relating to his work within the School of Public Health. Noteworthy here are records maintained by Francis on the extensive study undertaken by the School of Public Health on the state of public health in the small community of Tecumseh, Michigan.</p>

          <p>Speeches, articles, etc., 1928-1969 (4 linear feet). Like Organizations, this series is also a bringing together of similar kinds of files. Francis was a prolific writer, speaker, and attendee at professional conferences. In this series have been gathered files pertaining to symposia and conferences attended, reprints of articles, speeches and outlines of talks, and a scattering of some of the materials Francis used as an instructor at the University (1938-1940 only).</p>
