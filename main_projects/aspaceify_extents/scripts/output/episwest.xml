      <p>Although the Episcopal Diocese of Western Michigan was not established until 1874, the Episcopal Church first began ministering in this areas as early as the 1820s. In the first decade after the Civil War, many new parishes and mission were established, leading to the establishment of a diocese separate from the Diocese of Michigan in December of 1874.</p>
      <p>Elected on the first ballot, Reverend George D. Gillespie was chosen as the first Bishop of the Diocese. Bishop Gillespie began his association with the Diocese of Western Michigan as rector of St. Andrew's in Ann Arbor. He was consecrated as Bishop on the Feast of St. Matthias <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1875-02-24">February 24, 1875</unitdate> in St. Mark's Church in Grand Rapids. The limitations of advancing age brought about the election of his future replacement, the Rt. Reverend John N. McCormick, in 1906. Bishop Gillespie suffered a stroke in February of <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1907">1907</unitdate> and consequently resigned in the spring of the following year. He died on March 19, 1909.</p>
      <p>Bishop McCormick served an eight year rectorate at St. Mark's in Grand Rapids before being elected to serve as Bishop of the Diocese. Bishop McCormick succeeded Bishop Gillespie in <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1909">1909</unitdate> and served a thirty year term. On <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1936-01-21">January 21, 1936</unitdate> his 30th anniversary of consecration, Bishop McCormick asked the 62nd Annual Convention of the Diocese to elect a new Bishop. Bishop McCormick died three years later on November 26, 1939.</p>
      <p>The third Bishop of the Diocese, the Rt. Reverend Lewis B. Whittemore, was born on June 17, 1885. He served as rector of Grace Church, Grand Rapids before his election in 1936. Bishop Whittemore helped found two new congregations, St. Francis in Orangeville and St. Mary's in Cadillac. During his episcopacy, the "Bishop's News Letter" was established, the Women's Auxiliary was refashioned into the Episcopal Churchwomen, and the Bishop Whittemore Foundation was developed. At the <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1952">1952</unitdate> Convention, Bishop Whittemore submitted his resignation and retired on June 16, 1953. He died on December 5, 1965.</p>
      <p>At a special convention on <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1953-03-17">March 17, 1953</unitdate> Rev. Dudley B. McNeil was appointed Bishop Coadjutor. Prior to his election, he served at Sault Ste. Marie. Bishop McNeil helped to start many new congregations in the Diocese, including St. Andrew's in Grand Rapids, St. John's in Fremont, St. Gregory's in Muskegon, and St. James on Beaver Island. In the summer of <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1959">1959</unitdate> Bishop McNeil resigned due to ill health. The details of his subsequent life and death were not readily available in Diocesan records.</p>
      <p>Rt. Reverend Charles E. Bennison, the fifth Bishop of the Diocese of Western Michigan, was born on July 23, 1917. He was elected Bishop Coadjutor on <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1959-11-24">November 24, 1959</unitdate> and consecrated as Bishop on <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1960-02-24">February 24, 1960</unitdate> 85 years after the first Bishop was consecrated. Bishop Bennison began his career in the Diocese of Western Michigan as rector of St. Luke's in Kalamazoo, Michigan. During his episcopacy, Bishop Bennison re-established the deaneries of the diocese, began a companion relationship with the Dioceses of Kimberley and Kuruman, South Africa, formed the Commission on Ministry, Ordained and oversaw discussions on ordained women priests and human sexuality.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most noted accomplishment of Bishop Bennison's career was the Diocesan Center's move from Grand Rapids to Kalamazoo and the subsequent building of the Cathedral Church of Christ the King. In <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1964">1964</unitdate> at the 90th Annual Convention Meeting, Kalamazoo was designated See City. One year later, the Convention voted to embark upon a two million dollar capital funds drive to build the Cathedral and Diocesan Center. Construction began in <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1967">1967</unitdate> and the Cathedral was dedicated two years later.</p>
      <p>Bishop Bennison retired in <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1984">1984</unitdate> and was succeeded by Bishop Howard S. Meeks. Bishop Meeks was elected Bishop Coadjutor at the 109th Annual Convention, and was consecrated on October 6, 1984. In <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1988-01">January 1988</unitdate> Bishop Meeks resigned effective February 1st. The Standing Committee and Executive Council took charge of The Diocese and the Rt. Reverend Lyman C. Ogilby accepted the invitation to become an "Episcopal Visitor" during the interim.</p>
      <p>At a special convention held on <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1989-06-03">June 3, 1989</unitdate> Rev. Edward L. Lee was selected as Bishop Coadjutor to fill the position left vacant by Bishop Meeks. He served as rector of St. John's Church, Georgetown Parish in Washington, D.C. before coming to Michigan. He was consecrated on November 26, 1989.</p>
      <p>Robert R. Gepert was elected bishop <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="2001-10-19">October 19, 2001</unitdate> consecrated <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="2002-04-27">April 27, 2002</unitdate> and retired in August 2013. During his tenure, the diocese has faced significant financial challenges, and, in <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="2007">2007</unitdate> the Cathedral of Christ the King was sold.</p>

          <p>Another strength of the record group is its documentation of numerous local Episcopal parishes and missions in western Michigan. The files of the Diocesan Historiographer, the officer responsible for collecting historical information on diocesan churches, together with the correspondence files of the other diocesan offices document local parish activities, largely from about <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1930">1930</unitdate> to the 1980s. Included in the collection is the manuscript copy and additional notes for Rev. Franklin Smith's history <title render="italic">The Diocese of Western Michigan</title>. This volume provides a thorough history of the diocese to <unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1948">1948</unitdate> and should be consulted as background to the archival records. This series also includes files of historiographer Maurice F. Thomas and Betty Sutton. Within the Betty Sutton subseries, in addition to collected material on the individual parishes, there is an extensive set of files with biographical information on the priests of the diocese.</p>
