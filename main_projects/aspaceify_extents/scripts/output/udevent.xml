      <p>The Office of University and Development Events is responsible for planning and managing the University of Michigan's official and ceremonial events. The office plans and coordinates approximately 100 events annually, including commencements, faculty and student honors convocations, official presidential and regental activities, and development events such as campaign activities and donor receptions and programs. This unit also has oversight for the President's House and Inglis House operations. Previously, many of these responsibilities fell on several other units. The Office of the Chief Marshall of the University, and that of the Secretary of the University both at one time oversaw the planning of commencement activities. Planning for various other events has fallen under the Office of the Assistant to the President and the Office of the Vice President for Development. The creation of an office of University and Development Events was an effort at centralizing and coordinating planning and logistics.</p>
      <p>In early 1989 the Office of University Events was formally established. Anita Miller held the post designated at the time as Director of University Events and Assistant to the Secretary of the University. Responsibilities for development events and planning were gradually added to the position.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>Records of the University and Development Events office include files on major recurring campus events as well as special dedications and occasions. Events files often contain planning materials, correspondence, programs, scripts, invitation lists, newspaper clippings, and photographs. Photographs often depict decorations and event setup as well as those in attendance. The records are arranged within two series: Event Files and Audio Material.</p>

          <p>The Event Files were maintained by the office in chronological order by event. The chronological arrangement has been maintained with records for each year's events alphabetically arranged by event title. Records contained in this record group predate the official creation of the office, giving evidence of the previously dispersed functions.</p>
          <p>Files for the years 1964 through 1980 contain only one event per year, almost exclusively the Annual Meeting/ Football Weekend of the President's Club. It should be noted for those researching this Club or this event, that it is continued after 1986 under the titles President's Fall Weekend, President's Spring Weekend, or President's Weekend.</p>
          <p>From 1981 forward a greater number and variety of events are represented each year. Regularly included are such events as commencement, honors convocation, state of the university reports, the Henry Russel Lecture, football season events and bowl games, University Seminars, Women's Seminars, groundbreakings or dedications, conferences, inaugurations, and President's Weekends. Typically the records include detailed planning materials for the event, correspondence, programs, tickets, scripts for speeches, itineraries, invitation lists, newspaper clippings, and photographs. Photographs often depict decorations and event setup as well as people. Audiotapes are available for some of the larger events and are noted in the inventory. Of note are folders with planning materials for Commencements for 1964, when the speaker was President Lyndon B. Johnson, and 1991, when the speaker was President George H. W. Bush.</p>
          <p>From 1985 forward, there are often folders entitled "Miscellaneous Development Events," "Miscellaneous University Events," or "Miscellaneous Events." These include planning materials for various events throughout the year often not included in individual event folders, although events with individual folders are sometimes represented in the Miscellaneous folders.</p>
          <p>University Seminars brought together key donors and friends of the university for special lectures and demonstrations by faculty and staff members. Most seminar files include schedules of activities, background on the presenters, and photographs of the faculty lecturers and candid shots of the attendees at lectures or receptions.</p>
