      <p>The Center for Chinese Studies (CCS) was formed in 1961, and grew from an "area studies" tradition that was pioneered at the University of Michigan. Area studies are cross-disciplinary in nature to encourage broad and integrated understanding of various cultures. The area studies tradition at the university started in 1936 with the development of the Oriental Civilizations Program, which included instructors from eight different departments who were all specialists on Asia. The Center for Japanese Studies was formed in 1947 and has served as the model adopted by the Center for Chinese Studies as well as other area studies programs around the nation. At the University of Michigan the two centers have always enjoyed a close working relationship and jointly share many administrative tasks. Interest and financial support for area studies programs increased in the late 1950s with the passage of the National Defense Education Act and the Ford Foundation's decision to commit substantial funds for training and research in the field of Chinese studies. Initial funding for the CCS came from a ten year-Ford Foundation grant which was supplemented by a National Defense Education Act East Asia Center grant.</p>
      <p>Over the years the CCS has gained national recognition due to the efforts of its first two directors, Albert Feuerwerker and Alexander Eckstein. Both men served on a variety of national, professional and governmental committees relating to the study of and interaction with the People's Republic of China. The papers of Eckstein and Feuerwerker are housed at the Bentley Historical Library and are a source of additional materials for the researcher. A complete list of directors of the CCS since its inception is found on page iii.</p>
      <p>The center serves a variety of roles and is responsible for coordinating most activities on the University of Michigan campus relating to China. Pertinent departmental classes are coordinated by the CCS which also administers several interdisciplinary classes. The undergraduate and master's degree programs in Asian Studies, the Asia Library, and the Project on Asian Studies in Education (PASE) are administered by CCS in conjunction with other area centers. PASE is a pioneer university outreach effort designed to improve the quality of study of East Asia in small midwestern colleges and secondary schools, as well as to educate the American public on the societies, traditions and problems of East Asia.</p>
      <p>The CCS encourages research on China by awarding research funds to both Michigan faculty and to scholars from around the world who come to Ann Arbor to conduct their research. Research findings are often published by the CCS in <title render="italic">Michigan Papers in Chinese Studies</title>, a quarterly journal, or in a monograph series, which was formerly published by the University of California Press but is now "issued by" the University of Michigan Press.</p>
      <p>The center provides a variety of services to its students. It administers a graduate fellowship program to help offset the financial burdens experienced by graduate students who pursue an advanced degree in an area studies program. Fellowships are awarded to assist promising students to study in Asia. Since the interdisciplinary nature of the program results in a certain amount of faculty decentralization, the center serves as an important meeting ground for students and faculty. This role is supported primarily through the 'brown bag' lunches and colloquia programs.</p>

      <p>The Center for Chinese Studies record group consists primarily of material for the years 1962 to 1994. Overall strengths of the collection include documentation of PASE, records of the Asia Library (1962-1982), and course information from curriculum development (1960s). Yearly budget and financial records are fairly complete, except for the period from 1971 to 1976. The gap is unfortunate because it was during these years that the Ford Foundation grants ended and the center had to search for new funding sources. Other material is broadly illustrative of the diversity of the tasks undertaken by the center.</p>
      <p>The record group, as received by the Bentley Library, mostly consisted of loose documents and random topical folders. It now consists of topical folders arranged alphabetically within five series. The series Directors Correspondence and the Asia Library are in their original order, as received by the library; Administrative Records, Activities, and Printed Materials are artificial groupings created to provide order and easy access to the records.</p>
      <p>The Bentley Historical Library received another large transfer of records from the Center for Chinese Studies in 1997. Spanning the years 1966 through 1994, these consist primarily of administrative files and information pertaining to the activities which the Center for Chinese Studies organized or in which it participated. The records were relatively well organized when it was attained by the Bentley Library. The original order of the records was retained with the exception of some files pertaining to the East Asian Capital Campaign. These were reorganized so that they could be located in one series.</p>

            <p>The Administrative Records (1.5 linear feet) series contains materials relating to the daily operations of the CCS, the various projects it administers, and its interaction with the other area centers. They include correspondence, minutes, financial records, syllabi, reports, and proposals. Documents pertaining to the early history of the center, including several from 1958 which document the initial proposals to create the unit, are present in this series as are the fairly comprehensive PASE records. Class materials pertaining to the development of an interdisciplinary curriculum can be found in the Course files. The Correspondence files relate mostly to administrative tasks and intradepartmental communication. There are substantive reports concerning the state of the center in 1974 in the Faculty Retreat folder. The Executive Committee and Faculty Meetings folders contain correspondence but only scattered minutes.</p>

            <p>The Activities series (.75 linear feet) contains materials dating from 1963 to 1982, which document various events coordinated or sponsored by the CCS. This series illustrates the diversity of CCS functions undertaken in its role as a focus for the exchange of ideas between students, faculty, scholars, and the public. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' (CASS) records document the Ann Arbor portion of the first visit to the United States by scholars from the People's Republic of China. Included are background materials and correspondence pertaining to the goals of the exchange and the careers of the Chinese participants. The files on China After Mao and the National Press Institute on China record efforts to educate the American public about the People's Republic of China. Included are correspondence, memos, reports, publicity, and background materials. The Chinese Medical Exhibit folder relates to a university exhibit on traditional Chinese medical practices and contains twelve photographic prints of exhibit displays. Unfortunately there is no program or description present in the collection to explain the displays in detail.</p>

            <p>The Activities, 1969-1994 (.5 linear feet) subseries contains documents relating to the events which CCS organized or sponsored. It covers the period from 1969 to 1994. The Brown Bag Lunch subseries and the Alexander Eckstein Memorial Lecture subseries offer insight into topics of interest at CCS. Information pertaining to scholars active in the field of Chinese studies and research being performed at the University of Michigan and other Chinese studies programs can be found here. The Shanghai Municipal Archives Symposium subseries contains audio recordings of participants from a 2010 symposium sponsored by the Bentley Historical Library and the U-M Center for Chinese Studies in conjunction with the Sixth Joint Seminar on Archival Methods co-organized by the Bentley Library and the State Archives Administration of China. The one-day symposium on Archival Advances and Historical Research: Shanghai Municipal Archives and Beyond was held on October 28, 2010 at Palmer Commons on the U-M campus. Presentations by representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Archives were followed by commentaries from U-M faculty, Bentley Library archivists, the city archivist of Copenhagen, Denmark, and China scholars from the University of Toronto and Dickinson College. A total of thirty-six archivists from throughout China attended the event.</p>

          <p>The Director's Correspondence (.25 linear feet) series consists of incoming and outgoing correspondence from 1972 to 1982 during the period in which Albert Feuerwerker was the official director of the center and both Rhodes Murphey and Allen Whiting spent time as acting director. It is arranged alphabetically, although the researcher should be aware that documents may be filed by name of correspondent, name of organization, or subject heading. The correspondence illustrates the importance of the CCS director's role in the larger national and international scholarly communities of sinologists. Topics addressed in the correspondence include research, conferences, projects, and the formation and review of other Chinese studies departments. Of special interest is the correspondence found in the 'A' and 'R' folders that documents the response of China scholars in the West to the incarceration of Soviet sinologist Vitali Rubin.</p>
