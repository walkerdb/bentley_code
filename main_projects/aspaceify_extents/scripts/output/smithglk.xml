    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Gerald Lyman Kenneth Smith was born February 27, 1898 in Pardeeville, Wisconsin. Called to the ministry like his father, Lyman Z. Smith, and other members of his family before him, Smith attended Valparaiso University and Butler University in Indiana, and was then ordained a minister of the Disciples of Christ. In 1922, Smith married Elna Marion Sorenson, who came to be an active and important co-worker in the causes of her husband.</p>
      <p>During his early ministry, Smith held pastorates in Indianapolis, Indiana and in Shreveport, Louisiana. While in Louisiana, Smith became a close friend and supporter of Governor and later U.S. Senator, Huey Long. A noted orator, Smith soon became a major spokesman for Long's "Share the Wealth" Program, and was called upon to conduct the funeral service for Long following his assassination in 1935. During the 1936 election campaign, Smith was associated with Father Coughlin and Francis Townsend in the work of the Union Party.</p>
      <p>Even before election day, Smith had started to organize the Committee of 1,000,000, though it was not formally launched until March 1937. Formed as a nationalist front against the spread of communism, the Committee was isolationist, anti-union, and bitterly critical of the Roosevelt New Deal. In these years before World War II, Smith was searching for a base. He traveled about the country speaking whenever he could, and refining his image as a self-proclaimed crusader against communism and the C.I.O. In 1939, he began a series of broadcasts over WJR in Detroit, a powerful Midwestern station. Because of the receptiveness of this audience, some of whom were his larger financial backers, Smith decided to locate permanently in Detroit, moving there sometime that same year.</p>
      <p>Smith worked with the Committee of 1,000,000 into the early 1940's. In April 1942, he published the first issue of the Cross and the Flag which came to be the principal means by which he spread his ideological message. Also in 1942, Smith ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for the United States Senate from Michigan. Undaunted by the returns, he ran as an independent in the fall election, but was again badly defeated.</p>
      <p>In January 1943, Smith established the America First Party with the avowed purpose to provide an outlet for voters who might be dissatisfied with the candidates selected by the major parties in the 1944 national election. As Smith explained it, he hoped that his party would never have to go on the ballot, but since the Democrats and Republicans had already betrayed him and his followers in 1940 when they nominated "internationalists," he did not want them to be without recourse again. Smith did what he could to influence the choices of the major party conventions in 1944, but he was dissatisfied with Dewey and unalterably opposed to Roosevelt, so he felt compelled to run for president himself on the America First ticket.</p>
      <p>After the war, about 1946, Smith formed the Christian Nationalist Crusade, a federation of over 60 right wing organizations, all with the purpose of fighting communism and upholding the ideals of "Christian Americanism." Smith was made national director of the CNC which was then headquartered in Detroit. In 1947, he moved his base of operation from Detroit to St. Louis. He himself then decided to live in Tulsa.</p>
      <p>The Christian Nationalist Crusade, like most of Smith's other ideas, was based upon fear of a changing world and hatred of the supposed enemies of American and Christianity. Under the auspices of the CNC, Smith championed a variety of conservative and anti-communist causes. The CNC sponsored numerous meetings, distributed literature, organized petition campaigns, and lent their organizational skills to political candidates whose positions most resembled their own views. In 1952, Smith actively supported the candidacy of Douglas MacArthur for president. In the 1960's, he became a supporter of George Wallace.</p>
      <p>Despite its St. Louis base, some of the most important activities and conventions of the CNC were centered in California, where Smith found some of his most influential backers. Thus, in 1953, Smith moved to Los Angeles, California. He and the CNC stayed there nearly twenty years, then moved to Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Smith devoted the final years of his life to a number of religiously-oriented projects. One was the management of a full-scale Passion Play presented each year in Eureka Springs. Another was the completion of a towering Christ of the Ozarks statue for which Smith had helped to raise the money. Other plans for Eureka Springs stalled with his death on April 15, 1976.</p>

      <p>The papers of Gerald L.K. Smith include correspondence, speeches, oral history transcript, memoranda and other materials detailing his criticism of America's participation in World War II, his Michigan senatorial race in 1942, his campaign for the presidency in 1944, his opposition to the spread of communism after the war, and his support of conservative Christian causes and right wing individuals and organizations; and photographs.</p>
      <p>The major portion of the Gerald L.K. Smith papers came to the library in the spring of 1982. Before then, the library had accumulated a smaller group of Smith materials, mainly publications of the Christian Nationalist Crusade, mailings out of the Smith office from the 1960's and 1970's, the tapes and transcripts of an interview conducted with Smith in 1968 by a library staff member, and a few microfilm reels of a very small section of Smith's papers.</p>
      <p>With the 1982 accession, the Smith collection now totals 102 linear feet of correspondence, memoranda, clippings, published materials, and photographs and motion pictures. The collection covers the years, 1922-1976, but bulks largest for the period since 1939. Regrettably, only scattered materials for the period before 1939 have survived so there is slight documentation of Smith's activities in Louisiana with Huey Long. What has survived from these years are a few letters from parents, some published sermons and radio speeches, and an assortment of notes, clippings, and meeting materials. It is perhaps surprising that not more of the collection had been discarded or mislaid. As the papers came from storage in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, the earlier files had been shifted about several times as Smith and his organization moved their base of operation: from Louisiana to Detroit, to St. Louis, to Los Angeles, and then to Eureka Springs. Smith seems to have been a careful record-keeper, however, and very little of the post-1939 files needed processing.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The bulk of the Smith collection - the Chronological Series - has been arranged first by years, and then alphabetically within the year, so that except for the earlier years when groups of materials have been brought together, an alphabetical series exists for each year from 1943 to 1976. The amount of material for each year varies depending upon Smith's activities, but usually averages 3 to 4 linear feet. Inexplicably, the files for 1966 and 1967 are fragmentary, and may have been destroyed or mislaid. This series includes all types of materials, but consists primarily of correspondence. The file headings used are the names of individuals with whom Smith corresponded, organizations and issues in which he was interested, and places where Smith and his organization held meetings. There is also a miscellaneous folder for each letter of the alphabet.</p>
          <p>The subjects covered in the Chronological Series reflect Smith's own interests and activities. In general terms, the files concern the relationship between Smith and his ideological supporters, between Smith and his staff, attorneys, and those responsible for meeting arrangements and for the publication and distribution of the Cross and the Flag and other newsletters. Of special note are exchanges of letters between Smith and the many individuals who held contrary views.</p>
          <p>The Chronological Series is particularly valuable for information that it provides about the informal network and linkages among conservative organizations and individuals. Smith corresponded widely, and he and his staff collected material on the work of other conservatives, abroad as well as in the United States. Some of these individuals became closely associated with Smith and his work, speaking at his rallies or writing for the Cross and the Flag. Others started out with the Smith organization, then split off for ideological reasons or personal differences with Smith. Because Smith was a national figure, his files document conservative and anti-Zionist causes in many regions of the country and over a fairly broad period of time, 1940-1976. Correspondents and organizations represented in the collection include: George W. Armstrong (head of the Judge Armstrong Foundation for the furtherance of a unified anti-Semitic movement), John O. Beaty (university teacher and author of The Iron Curtain over America), Mrs. Catherine Brown (head of the National Blue Star Mothers of America), Elizabeth Dilling (anti-Communist crusader and director of the Patriotic Research Bureau), Myron C. Fagan (national director of the anti-Communist, Cinema Educational Guild), Kenneth Goff (pastor and head of various anti-Communist organizations in Colorado), Norman Jaques (Canadian M.P. and supporter of Smith and his work), Frederick Kister (director of the Christian Veterans of America), Conde McGinley (editor of anti-Communist newspaper, Common Sense), Leland Marion (pastor, and candidate for governor of Michigan in 1944 on the America First ticket), Jonathan E. Perkins (Los Angeles pastor and supporter of Smith), Harvey H. Springer (Colorado pastor and editor of Western Voice), Jack B. Tenney (California state senator and candidate for vice-president on the Christian National Party ticket in 1952), Rev. A. W. Terminiello ("Father Coughlin of the South," secretary of the Union of Christian Crusaders), Gerald P. Winrod (prominent pastor and publisher of Christian, anti Communist journal, The Defender).</p>
          <p>In addition, the Smith correspondence files contain letters from significant individuals who had no direct ties to Smith buy were responding to queries from Smith, or who were seeking Smith's advice. Smith sometimes initiated correspondence with individuals, either to castigate or compliment them, or just to spread his own views more broadly. Such correspondence is usually not extensive, but the letters are always of interest. Such correspondents include: H.L. Mencken, William F. Buckley, Gamal Abdul Nasser, Robert Welch, George Lincoln Rockwell, Westbrook Pegler, George Sokolsky, Arthur Vandenberg, and Ernest Liebold (secretary to Henry Ford).</p>

          <p>The collection includes a body of records, labeled for convenience Administrative Files. Preserved in fragments for the years between 1948 and the early 1970s, this series details the day-to-day operation of the Smith office. Much of the correspondence in this file was addressed to the Christian Nationalist Crusade, and the replies are either form responses from Smith or from his office manager, Opal Tanner White. The importance of the file is its documentation of the kind of support which Smith received. Some of the letters are responses to Smith's appeals for funds or free literature. Some concern problems with subscriptions to the Cross and the Flag; while others come from people concerned about current events or with information to offer about the state of the world.</p>

          <p>The Oral history/Microfilm project series consists of materials collected or accumulated by the Michigan Historical Collections prior to the accessioning of the bulk of the Smith papers in 1982. Included is the transcript to the interview made with Gerald L. K. Smith in 1968 by staff members of the library, also correspondence between Smith and the MHC, and collected materials about Smith and his organization. A portion of this series consists of the microfilm of selections of the Smith papers made in the early 1970s. This microfilm was made at Smith's office in Los Angeles. The originals of these films subsequently came to the library in 1982.</p>

          <p>The Smith collection also includes a group of files relating to Opal Tanner's work as secretary of the United Farmers of America. Tanner (later Opal Tanner White) was with this organization at the time of her first involvement with Smith, and this no doubt explains why the records of UFA are now part of the Smith collection. The UFA records are of interest because it was a politically conservative organization whose head was supportive of some of the same causes as Smith.</p>
