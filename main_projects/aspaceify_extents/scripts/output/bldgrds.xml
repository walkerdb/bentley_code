    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>During the late 1800s the maintenance of the buildings and grounds on the campus of the University of Michigan was the job of a group of loosely organized workers. Janitorial services were not provided by a central department. Instead, janitors worked under the direction of the Business Office. In 1910 James Harmon Marks was appointed the first superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. Under the guidance of Marks, Buildings and Grounds became a centralized department, to which many previously independent units reported. The main focus of the department was to maintain the interiors and exteriors of buildings and to deliver coal for heating the university's buildings. In the 1920s Buildings and Grounds constructed a series of tunnels throughout the campus which connected all of the campus buildings to the Washington Street Power Plant. The tunnels enabled Buildings and Grounds to provide all of the heat and electricity for the buildings from a single source. In subsequent years the department began to oversee many other university units related to the expansion of the campus. To reflect Buildings and Grounds' changing role the Board of Regents changed the Buildings and Grounds Department name in 1930 to the Plant Extension Services Department. The duties of the newly organized Plant Extension Services included serving as a liaison between the university units responsible for financial accountability, construction engineering, engineering services, the university architect's office and the university planner's office. In addition the department monitors and coordinates all new construction as well as the expansion of existing buildings.</p>
      <p>The Buildings and Grounds record group is largely composed of photographs which document the period of expansion that began when Marion L. Burton took office as the president of the university in 1920. That same year, the Board of Regents appointed a committee to evaluate the spatial needs of the university. In January 1921 the committee reported to Burton and the Regents that the university would need $19,000,000 for a suitable building project to commence. The university petitioned the state legislature and was given a large portion of the money. A committee was created which oversaw all of the plans for expansion. The committee was called "the committee on the comprehensive building program," but is generally referred to as "the committee of five;" its members were: Regent William L. Clements, President Burton, Secretary Shirley Wheeler Smith, architect Albert Kahn and Professor John Shepard. The buildings that were constructed under the initial wave of expansion were: East Medical (Clarence Cook Little), Literary Building (Angell Hall), East Engineering Building, Model (University) High School (School of Education), New Physics Laboratory, the expansion of University Hospital (Old Main) and the addition to the Dental Building. The university bought many of the surrounding houses and properties in order for some of the new buildings to be constructed. The university expansion peaked the interest of private donors which resulted in the money that built the Clements Library and Yost Field House. With the success of the first phase of building the university again asked the state legislature for more funds to continue the building efforts. The state granted the university money which resulted in the construction of an addition to the power plant. At the same time more donations led to the construction of the Lawyer's Club and Couzens Hall. President Burton made a third appeal for money to the state, but prior to it being granted, he died. His request was approved and the funds resulted in the building of a new museum and the Architecture Building (Lorch Hall) in 1925.</p>
      <p>Additional material relating to the Buildings and Grounds Department and President Burton's building projects can be found in the University of Michigan Plant Extension Services record group as well as the proceedings of the Board of Regents and the papers of the presidents.</p>

      <p>The record group for the Buildings and Grounds Department is primarily comprised of visual materials that document the construction projects which the department oversaw. The bulk of the records are from the 1920s, with the photographs composing the largest portion of the collection. Non-original images of some university buildings from the 1800s are also included.</p>
      <p>The records are arranged into six series: Architectural Drawings, Photo Albums, Photographs, Lantern Slides, Glass Plate Negatives, and Topographical Maps.</p>

          <p>The series Photo Albums (1923-1940) contains two bound 8x10 photo albums. The first is a scrapbook that was assembled by Buildings and Grounds. It contains 5x7 photographs of every campus building that was in use in 1923. There are also photographs of the houses that were located on the property acquired for new construction. In addition to photographs the album contains a fact sheet listing building specifications, construction costs and the architect. The second album (labeled WPA) contains photographs of the construction of an addition onto the Health Services Building, which was completed in 1938.</p>

          <p>Photographs (1913-1956) document the comprehensive building program that occurred in the early 1920s during the presidency of Marion Burton. According to the Board of Regents proceedings, Burton, at one point, requested to see photographs of buildings that other universities had constructed. It was perhaps that which inspired him to have his building project so well documented in photographs. The photographer (or photographers) of the pictures is somewhat of a mystery, but evidence suggests that Mr. Eugene Francisco, first of Lyndon Photographers and then with Francisco and Boyce Photographers, was responsible for taking many of the pictures. Some later photographs are stamped with the name of George Korwin, who was also a photographer in the Ann Arbor area. Of special interest are the photos of the construction of the Clements Library. The photos show how the building was built while the Old Engineering Building next to it was being razed. Also of special interest are the photos of the construction of Angell Hall. On the back of several of the prints are the content of descriptions of the pictures. Many of the later photographs, which document the initial stages of building of North Campus, will also be of interest. Some of the photos were taken on the roof of the Veterans Administration Hospital and provide an excellent birds-eye-view of the South side of the North Campus area along Fuller Road.</p>
          <p>The series contains many prints, the bulk of which have a matching original negative. The series also contains prints without negatives and some negatives without prints. The photographs are arranged alphabetically by the name of the building or subject that appears in them. There are three types of identifying systems in this series: bound prints with matching negatives, unbound prints with matching negatives, and lastly unbound, unmatched prints or negatives. The prints in the bound books have a number (1,2,3,4....) on the back. The negative that matches each print has a corresponding number on the envelope in which it is contained. The prints that are not bound and have a matching negative are labeled with both a letter and a number (A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4...). These are found on both the back of the print and on the envelope in which the negative is housed. The prints that have corresponding negatives are labeled alphabetically A,B,C... (if there are more than twenty-six than the system continues A-1, B-1, C-1...). The same system is used for negatives without matching prints. The envelopes are labeled either "print" or "negative" to differentiate.</p>

          <p>Lantern Slides (1927-1941) compose the fourth series. The slides are in numerical order and the negatives that match the slides are filed with the Photograph series and contain the number corresponding to the slide. If there is no matching negative, it is noted on the envelope containing the slide. The slides are of the interiors and exteriors of campus buildings. In addition, the end of the series contains slides of Buildings and Grounds employees, who appear to be members of the janitorial staff.</p>
