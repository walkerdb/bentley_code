      <p>The Little Traverse Conservancy, located in Harbor Springs in Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula, is a private, not-for-profit organization dedicated to preserving unique and environmentally sensitive land in northern Michigan through purchase, donation and conservation easement. Its founding members, Dr. John Tanton, David Irish, Frank Pierce, and Earl Larson, along with legal counsel and ally Seberon "Boo" Litzenburger and supporters Ed Koza and John Fischer, originally joined together as the Little Traverse Group in 1972 to file suit to stop two highly commercial developments being planned for the area, Cedar Cove and the Birchwood Farms Project, which they felt were a threat to the area's environment and natural character. Although some modifications to and limits on the developments resulted, the lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful and it created controversy and resentment within the community.</p>
      <p>Because of these problems, the Little Traverse Group decided instead to form a land conservancy, by means of which they would preserve land by buying it rather than fighting expensive, divisive, and potentially unsuccessful legal battles. Thus, the Little Traverse Conservancy was born, incorporating itself in 1972. Models for the new organization were established land conservancies: The Nature Conservancy (a national body) and the Collier County Conservancy in western Florida. In addition, co-founder John Tanton discovered the Summer Resort and Playground Act of 1911, which exempted land held in trust by certain organizations from paying property taxes. This was to prove a great boon to the group.</p>
      <p>The early Little Traverse Conservancy (LTC) was led by (and consisted mainly of) its Executive Committee, made up of the original Little Traverse Group members and joinee Wrigley "Bud" Offield. In its initial stage, there was no executive director or any other permanent staff, with day-to-day leadership coming from the Executive Committee and less frequent guidance from the Board of Trustees. All work was done on a volunteer basis. In 1979, the first executive director position was created on a half-time basis, with Kathy Bricker filling the position. The following year, Susanne Dye took over, with C. Louis Borie, LTC's first full-time director, following her. (Further details of this and other key roles within LTC are provided in the organizational chart and timeline at the end of this section.)</p>
      <p>With each passing year, LTC grew in membership, staffing, and know-how, as well as increasing the number of its nature preserves and land protection programs. LTC produced its first annual report in 1980. In 1981 it developed the "Friends of the Little Traverse Conservancy" fundraising program, under the strong leadership and tireless efforts of Horace "Huffy" Huffman, an influential leader in numerous areas of the organization for many years.</p>
      <p>Huffman was the son of the founder of the bicycle company Huffy Corporation and its CEO before taking early retirement and becoming active in the Little Traverse Conservancy. A Trustee as early as 1972, he served in many different capacities, including vice-president for Membership, in charge of the Friends of the Little Traverse Conservancy Fundraising Program; chairman of the Land Acquisition Program; secretary of the Executive Committee from 1984 to 1987; and chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee. Huffman was responsible for shaping LTC's organizational structure early on and was so personally involved in the fundraising process that he eventually felt the need to train others in this area so that LTC would not become too dependent on any one individual. He also served as a mentor to the executive directors, particularly Tom Bailey.</p>
      <p>The first land acquisitions were donated, mainly by group members and their friends and relatives, but in 1984, LTC completed its first land purchase, Orchis Fen. This was also the year that initial work began on the Colonial Point Forest Project, a three-year effort to save a unique parcel of red oak forest that had been recently fallen under the ownership of a lumber company. The organization was progressing internally as well. 1984 saw a move of the LTC office building to its current site at its own Round Lake Nature Preserve; Tom Bailey, longtime and current executive director, came aboard near the end of the year, officially assuming leadership in January of 1985; and Tom Lagerstrom was hired as membership coordinator (later returning as associate director). In 1985, the Colonial Point Forest Project was officially initiated and an endowment fund created to ensure the long-term maintenance of existing and future preserves.</p>
      <p>1987 was significant for the foundation of the Business Advisory Committee, which provided a two-way channel of communication between area businesses and the Conservancy and encouraged formal participation by businesses in LTC's conservation efforts. Also in this year, the North Point Preservation Project began. This project's goal was to preserve twenty-eight acres of sand dunes and 2,800 feet of Lake Michigan shoreline in Charlevoix Township. In addition, Huffman retired from his leadership positions in all areas, except for his trusteeship and his chairmanship of the Building and Grounds Committee.</p>
      <p>Huffman and his committee undertook a major office and grounds improvement project (his pet project; LTC's office building was later known as "the house that Huffy built") beginning in 1988. The Conservancy launched a new State-Local Government Cooperation program in order to help local units of government with the purchase and planning of land for public parks. It also started a scholarship program, named the Woodbury Ransom Memorial Scholarship in Environmental Studies, at Warren Wilson College in Swannanoa, North Carolina. It was funded through the contribution of an LTC member.</p>
      <p>In 1989 LTC started its well-received conservation easement program, which allows landowners to permanently designate parcels of land as natural areas without having to transfer ownership to the Conservancy. Also, Tom Bailey began developing a strategic plan for the Conservancy. The M-119 Scenic Protection Program started in 1990. Its goal was to preserve a border of natural scenery along the roadway. The need for the protection of other areas besides wetlands and forests was also becoming recognized at this time, and LTC started its Farmland Protection Program. In 1991, an addition to the office building (again spearheaded by Huffman) began and was completed over the next year. By 1992, LTC's twentieth anniversary year, staff consisted of seven full-time employees, and over 100 land preservation projects had been completed since the Conservancy's founding.</p>
      <p>By 1995 LTC had become such a well-established and professional organization that it was able to serve a crucial role in helping to establish a new land conservancy, the Headlands Conservancy, near Mackinaw City. By this time LTC had become fully professional from within as well, with a comprehensive employee benefits policy and a revised personnel policy firmly in place, both spearheaded by Tom Bailey. In addition, Bailey encouraged staff development, both sponsoring staff training seminars and attending leadership conferences himself. Because of LTC's success, similar organizations began to look to LTC as a model and mentor.</p>
      <p>A great blow was dealt to everyone at LTC, professionally and personally, when Horace Huffman died of a heart attack in late November of 1996. The Little Traverse Conservancy carried on, however, and maintains its emphasis on conservation through acquisition of land rather than legal confrontation or political maneuvering.</p>
      <p>Among the most significant projects undertaken by the Little Traverse Conservancy were:</p>
      <p>Thorne Swift Nature Preserve Project: The Thorne Swift Nature Preserve opened in May of 1983 on thirty acres of land donated by Elizabeth Kennedy. The land is held by LTC and leased to West Traverse Township, which shares management of the preserve with LTC. This is the most 'developed' of LTC's preserves, with board trails over swamps, an interpretive center, two naturalists on staff, and a resident manager. Primary motivations for the preserve were to provide public access to Lake Michigan (much of the lakefront being privately held) and to offer a place for the public to enjoy and learn about nature.</p>
      <p>North Point Project: The drive to purchase this land ran from 1987 to 1989 and involved a successful campaign to save twenty-eight acres of sand dunes, along with 2,800 feet of Lake Michigan shoreline, and create a public preserve.</p>
      <p>Colonial Point Forest Project: The Colonial Point Forest is a 283-acre stand of red oaks, some as old as 150 years, that was sold to sawmill operator James Devereaux in 1985. Devereaux, realizing the uniqueness of the forest, was actually somewhat reluctant to log it and was willing to sell it to LTC for $1.25 million, provided they could meet the necessary interest payments over a three-year period. LTC launched an extensive fundraising campaign and by 1987 the needed funds were obtained. The forest, once purchased by LTC, was then turned over to the University of Michigan Biological Station, which had been conducting research in the forest for over fifty years prior to its sale. The forest was also opened to the public as a nature preserve.</p>

      <p>The records of the Little Traverse Conservancy (LTC) document the organization’s history and dealings. The record group sheds light on the accomplishments of LTC, most notably its land acquisitions, the establishment of its nature preserves, and its environmental education program, as well as its internal organization and growth. In addition, other activities of its members are documented, in particular those of executive director Tom Bailey, who has served in various capacities in several other community- and state-based organizations. The LTC records cover the period from the Conservancy’s founding in 1972 to 2006. The record group is divided into six series: Background Information, Early Board of Trustees Files, the Horace M. Huffman, Jr. Files, Projects, Executive Director Files (Tom Bailey), and Tom Bailey - Other activities. Correspondence in all series is primarily outgoing. Most files are ordered chronologically (generally in reverse chronological order) unless otherwise noted.</p>

          <p>The first series, Early Board of Trustees Files (1 linear foot), consists of six subseries: Executive director's reports, Administrative documents, Executive Committee and Board of Trustees business, Other committees, LTC budgets, and the John Fischer (early chairman) files. The series as a whole provides a good introduction to the history and early activities of LTC. The first subseries, Executive director's reports, provides useful summaries of the major activities for the years 1980-1983, as do the minutes of the annual meetings from the Executive Committee and Board of Trustees subseries, which cover the years 1972-1985.</p>
          <p>The John Fischer subseries contains some of the earliest items from LTC's history, including the original Articles of Incorporation. It consists of two folders, one arranged chronologically and the other containing miscellaneous undated material. John Fischer, one of the first LTC members, served as chairman in the group's early years, as well as treasurer early on and later. His subseries contains correspondence with founder John Tanton and early LTC documents and writings, including newspaper stories on the group's initial efforts.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Horace M. Huffman, Jr. Files series (1.7 linear feet) contains the files kept by Huffman who served variously as trustee, vice-president of Membership, Executive Committee secretary and chairman of Building and Grounds Committee. Files relating to the many roles he played in the organization can be found among the contents listing. The extent of Huffman's files indicates the degree of his influence on LTC, given the fact that he was not officially involved with all of the activities that they detail.</p>
          <p>The series consists of topical files arranged alphabetically, with the items within the files in chronological order. These files span the duration of Huffman's tenure at LTC, not just his period as Executive Committee secretary, bearing witness to his strong guiding hand in the affairs of the organization, both in official capacities and from behind the scenes. The Colonial Point-Burt Lake file contains photographs of red oak trees in the Colonial Point Forest and the Office, Powell Road file has photographs of the renovated office exterior.</p>
          <p>Other significant items in the series include correspondence relating to the Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council, of which Huffman was a founder and strong supporting member, and which shared office space with the Little Traverse Conservancy. Part of its role is ensuring clean waterways in the region, and its stance is one of more open advocacy than is LTC's. The Inland Lakes Program file was compiled by Huffman as part of the Watershed Council rather than LTC and contains a letter with a brief description of how the two organizations differ.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that the files entitled "Cement Plant, Petoskey," "Dundee Cement Plant," and "Holnam Project" all refer to the same endeavor: the attempt by LTC to secure the site of a former cement plant in Petoskey (owned by the Holnam Company, which has another, active plant in Dundee, in southeastern lower Michigan) for preservation. During this same time, a developer by the name of LoPatin was in competing negotiations with Holnam to purchase the site in order to turn it into a resort area.</p>

          <p>The Projects series (1.3 linear feet) details the major land preservation projects undertaken by LTC (many other minor projects not mentioned in this series are referred to in other series, particularly in the Tom Bailey Files and the Horace M. Huffman, Jr. Files). The subseries are as follows: the Thorne Swift Nature Preserve Project, the North Point Project, and the Colonial Point Forest Project.</p>
          <p>The Thorne Swift Nature Preserve Project subseries spans 1976-1984 and contains documents relating to its establishment and management. Included in the subseries are many newspaper articles and one photograph of a Lake Michigan beach.</p>
          <p>The North Point Project subseries consists of one binder kept by Tom Bailey. Included in the subseries are minutes of the North Point Committee meetings that describe the project's progress, correspondence, and clippings.</p>
          <p>The Colonial Point Forest Project subseries describes one of LTC's largest and most ambitious undertakings and is consequently its most extensively documented project. The subseries is divided into six sub-subseries which roughly represent the major phases of the project. They are Initial stages, Foundations and endowments, Project work, Follow-up activities, Miscellaneous items, and Tom Bailey's Colonial Point files. There are two files entitled "Land Trust Fund," one found within the Initial stages sub-subseries and covering March 1985-August 1986 and the other found in the Foundations sub-subseries and covering May 1985-June 1987. The information is similar in content and some of it is duplicated.</p>
          <p>Some controversy arose while the project was ongoing when an Indian claim to the land surfaced. A legal document dating from 1917 was eventually discovered that was accepted as voiding the claim, however. This topic is dealt with in the Indian title claim files within the Initial stages sub-subseries and the Tom Bailey's Colonial Point files sub-subseries, and also in newspaper clippings and letters found within the General correspondence files of the Project work sub-subseries.</p>
          <p>Of some minor interest in the Follow-up activities sub-subseries is correspondence with Willard Scott of the "Today Show" regarding an invitation for him to conduct a weather report from Colonial Point Forest. In the end he was unable to do so, however.</p>
          <p>The items in the final sub-subseries, Tom Bailey's Colonial Point files, duplicate or supplement the rest of the series and provide a useful "at-a-glance" summary of the project.</p>

          <p>The Executive Director Files (Tom Bailey) Files series (4.5 linear feet) is important in supplementing the topical files with more information on the various projects of the LTC. The researcher will find it useful to cross-reference topics referred to elsewhere in the record group with items from the appropriate dates in this series. In addition, the series charts the development of LTC with Bailey at its helm and provide insights into the mind and personality of its longest-serving executive director. The series documents LTC affairs from late 1984 on from its executive director’s perspective. The files are chronological and cover the period from Bailey’s arrival in December 1984 through 2006. From 1984 to 1992, each annual file is divided into general headings of Correspondence, Memos, Meeting Notes, and News releases, with the additional “Activity Reports” in 1988, covering the span of 1986-1988. Items under this level are arranged chronologically. (An exception occurs in 1992, when letters and memoranda are merged into one “Correspondence” file.) From 1993 on, rather than being separated by form, all items are intermixed within one annual file and arranged strictly chronologically, with the addition of a separate “Policy development” file in 1993. The year 1995 saw the addition of e-mail into LTC’s correspondence.</p>
          <p>Included in the Correspondence files are many thank you letters for financial and land donations, along with leads on potential future donors, correspondence regarding projects and other LTC business, and some personal correspondence to friends and family members. The memos provide a clearer picture of project details and an inside look at LTC. Good summaries of LTC activities are provided in the Meeting notes files (which consist mainly of Executive Committee meeting minutes, with some additional handwritten notes) and the News releases files, when available.</p>
          <p>Some important events and topics in LTC history that are referenced in the series include the Indian title claim and other Colonial Point business in 1985 and 1986, the development of a new personnel policy beginning in 1987, the Holnam cement plant deal in January-March of 1991 (and some limited follow-up to it in 1992-1993), a staff development workshop in April 1993, and some follow up on an earlier proposed name change to LTC (see the LTC name change file in the Horace Huffman, Jr. Files series) in November 1995. A topic of interest not discussed elsewhere in the record group includes Tom Bailey’s growing concerns and thoughts about public policy, tax policy, and urban sprawl as expressed in a letter to James Richmond of the Frey Foundation in August 1992. The draft of a moving tribute to Huffy’s memory can be found in a letter of condolence that Bailey wrote to Huffman’s widow, Jane, on December 6, 1996.</p>
          <p>Several instances of LTC’s association with the area’s local Ottawa (Odawa) Indians, the Little Traverse Bay Bands, come up. These include outgoing correspondence to Native American columnist Simon Otto from 1993 through 1996; LTC’s official support of the Little Traverse Bay Bands (LTBB) in the latter’s goal of federal recognition in August 1994; the drafting of policies in September 1994 allowing and regulating the gathering of plants growing on LTC preserves for medicinal and ceremonial use; and Bailey’s efforts, beginning in September 1996, to include a representative of the bands on the LTC Board of Trustees (although some mention had been made to there being an LTBB representative on the board as early as 1995).</p>
          <p>Some topics in the series fall outside of the realm of Tom Bailey’s official role as executive director and represent his private efforts. In September 1995 there is correspondence regarding a recent testimony, in Bailey’s private rather than organizational capacity, before State Senator George McManus’ Senate Select Committee on Public Land Ownership, Purchase and Management, and subsequent correspondence in February 1996. Bailey had, in particular, opposed the raiding of the Natural Resources Trust Fund by the legislature for projects not related to the environment. From March 1995 to June 1996, Bailey was involved, along with Horace M. Huffman, in the bicycle pathway project of the Tri-County Bikeway Committee. From June 1996 to September 1997 Bailey corresponded with the directors and staff of the Holy Childhood Daycare Center, mainly in regard to the forced retirement, to which Bailey was opposed, of the elderly Sisters staffing the center. Throughout the series one will find references to Bailey’s personal convictions, such as his pro-hunting, pro-gun ownership beliefs, as well as his interests, such as his newfound passion for guitar-playing in 1997.</p>

          <p>The Tom Bailey: Other activities (1.5 linear feet) series contains more information related to other roles Tom Bailey has played in addition to LTC executive director. This series further illustrates Bailey’s strong commitment to environmental causes and his personal convictions. Roles include chairman of the Emmet County Park and Recreation Committee in 1992 (and vice-chairman in 1991) and chairman of the Emmet County Solid Waste Planning Advisory Committee from 1982 to 1990. These roles and the activities of the committees are documented in those files. Before his arrival at LTC, Bailey was Water Quality Specialist for the DNR and Michigan EPA and as such was involved in a lawsuit in which he cited the Addison Products company for violation of hazardous waste labeling requirements. The case began in 1983 and ended in 1986. Also in the series is the Natural Resources Commission files, which documents Bailey’s efforts, and those of others on his behalf, to obtain an appointment to the Engler Administration’s Natural Resources Commission. He was ultimately successful, being made a member of the Water Resources Commission in July 1993. Other files document his earlier activities as an environmentalist. These include his work with the Michigan Student Environmental Confederation and his support of legislation designating a portion of Isle Royale as a wilderness area. Folders with projects dated after the year 2000 include material on Bailey's involvement with creation of the Heart of the Lakes Center for Land Conservation Policy and the Emmet County Recreation Complex. The series also includes Bailey's published newspaper and journal articles, transcripts of his speeches, material of seminars and presentations given by Bailey, as well as clippings of articles about Bailey and his activities, dated from 1984 to 2012.</p>
