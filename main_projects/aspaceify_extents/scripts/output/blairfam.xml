      <p>The Blair family is one of the more notable families of Michigan. The compiler of this collection of papers, Helen Marie Blair Lamar (1898-1981), was the daughter of Charles A. Blair (1854-1912), who served as attorney general and justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan, and granddaughter of Austin Blair (1818-1894), the governor of Michigan during the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Austin Blair was born in Caroline, New York and moved to Jackson, Michigan in 1841 to practice law. He took an active part in the formation of the Republican Party "under the oaks" of Jackson in 1854 and became increasingly more involved in politics, serving as governor and then as congressman.</p>
      <p>George H. Blair, the eldest of Austin's sons, had a difficult life. He had trouble holding a job and worked off and on for the United States Postal Service. He married Vienna Peck in 1878 and they had three children. George accidentally shot his son Charles Austin's arm off while cleaning his gun. In 1897 Vienna divorced him after he committed adultery with Josephine Darrell. His brother Charles intervened, making him leave his mistress and go down to Florida, where the Blair brothers had bought some land. In 1901 he was paralyzed and returned to his brother Charles' house in Jackson, where he spent the last three years of his life as an invalid.</p>
      <p>Charles Austin Blair, the second of Austin and Sarah Blair's four sons, graduated from the University of Michigan in 1876 and later was a member of the Board of Regents, as was his father. He was the responsible brother, often helping his less steady brothers get jobs, and giving them substantial financial support. He married Effie Caroline North (1861-1944) in 1879 and they had four children. Effie's parents were Guy Franklin North (1832-1890), trumpeter of the 18th Michigan Infantry, Company B, during the Civil War, and Ella Aurelia Hanks North Cole (1837-1917).</p>
      <p>Two of Charles and Effie Blair's four children survived childhood. George Fred Blair (1880-1955) graduated from Annapolis and spent several years in the navy before trying his hand at various unsuccessful business ventures. He married Lucie Chamberlain, the daughter of Oregon Governor and Senator George Chamberlain, and had five children. Helen Marie Blair Lamar (1898-1981), known as "Peachie," went to Gunston Hall School in Washington, D.C. and then to St. Mary's Academy and College in Portland, Oregon. She married George "Jack" Lamar in 1921.</p>
      <p>Austin Blair's other two sons were Frederick Johnson Blair (1860-1943) and Austin True Blair (1864-1944). Fred married four times, once to a second cousin. He ended up in Washington D.C., working for the government, after a stint spent attempting to grow pineapples in Florida. Austin True was an actor in New York. He seemed to write brother Charles the most persistent appeals for financial assistance, for work was often scarce and he had a chronic gambling problem.</p>

      <p>Helen Blair Lamar kept the papers of the Blair, Hanks and North families for many years. After her death they were given to the Blair Society for Genealogical Research, which in turn donated them to the Bentley Historical Library. This collection exemplifies the slightly random character of family papers accumulated over several generations. There is a wide variety of material on a large number of individuals. In an attempt to keep things as clear as possible, the majority of the papers--manuscript, typescript and printed--have been arranged by FAMILY GROUPS which are subdivided by Personal Name and arranged by generation. This is followed by a small second series of miscellaneous PRINTED MATERIALS. A substantial third series of VISUAL MATERIALS includes Scrapbooks, Photographs, Daguerreotypes and Ambrotypes, Tintypes and Glass Plate Negatives.</p>

          <p>The first series, comprised of manuscript material, some printed material and some unique items, including handpainted silk and locks of hair from children who died young, is arranged by Family Groups. Helen Blair Lamar created typed transcriptions of much of the correspondence of her parents, Charles Austin and Effie North Blair. She apparently discarded a significant amount of original material, for a note written to her niece Betty Blair Grandstaff in 1958 reads, "I am discarding more boxes full of letters."</p>
          <p>As a result, the majority of the correspondence of the collection is in the non-original format of three typescript volumes entitled "Life of Charles A. Blair," volumes 1 and 2, and "Letters of Effie C. Blair." Much of Charles Blair's correspondence is with his three brothers, and spans over 35 years. As adults, the brothers often relied on Charles for support and utilized a variety of tactics, from cajoling to threatening, to extract favors and funds from him. The first volume includes brother George Blair's colorful accounts from Wyoming, where he was prospecting for gold in 1876.</p>
          <p>The volume of letters from Effie to her daughter Helen spans a 20 year period, from 1924 until Effie's death in 1944. These informative letters are packed with meticulous descriptions of Effie's daily life. This volume also includes early letters to Helen from her Gunston Hall School chums. All three volumes include transcriptions of newspaper articles and other materials in addition to correspondence.</p>
          <p>There are also a few noteworthy letters that have survived in the original. Guy North wrote a fascinating letter to his new wife Ella Hanks North on the eve of his enlistment in the Civil War. Lot V. North (1806-1900), Guy's father, struck up a correspondence with his granddaughter Effie North Blair late in his life and writes at great length about his religious views. There are two letters written in 1895 by Hattie Rea to her sister Alice, second wife of Frederick Johnson Blair (1860-1943). Hattie details what the newlyweds will need when they join her in the wilds of Florida. Both Fred and George Blair, with the financial support of brother Charles, unsuccessfully attempted to start pineapple plantations on the St. Lucie River in Florida. There is also a smattering of original family letters, business correspondence and greeting cards. Typed transcriptions are noted; otherwise, assume the item is in its original manuscript format.</p>
          <p>The collection includes two journals kept by Ella Hanks North Cole (1837-1917), spanning the years from 1890 to 1906. She played the organ for several churches in Toledo, Ohio and then in Jackson, Michigan, where she lived with her daughter Effie North Blair's family. Due to financial difficulties, Ella was unable to stay with her second husband, Myron Cole, who was dying of cancer of the face back in Toledo. After his death, Ella remained with her daughter until her own death in 1917. The journals detail her health, money troubles, attendance at church functions and ambivalence about card playing.</p>
          <p>Another set of writings in this collection are a series of newspaper articles about "Historic Jackson County" and some unpublished short stories by Nellie Blair Greene (1882-1953). She was Helen Blair Lamar's cousin, and later married her cousin Harriet's widower and wrote for wrestling magazines.</p>
          <p>There is a wide variety of official documents and printed items, including wedding certificates, deeds and invitations to important events. Most of these materials are in the first series, within the subseries of the person to whom they relate.</p>
          <p>Information about the Blair, Hanks, North and related families is in evidence throughout this collection. There are, as well, several folders of specifically genealogical material, including notes, Daughters of the American Revolution applications and acid-free copies of newspaper clippings. These are filed in the Helen Blair Lamar subseries, for she apparently generated the majority of this material. A large Blair Family tree is housed in the oversize folder. A number of family group charts, supplied by the processor, have been added to the very beginning of the collection, along with other background materials, in order to help the researcher grasp the genealogy. They are accurate to the best of her knowledge.</p>

          <p>The manuscript and printed materials are complemented by the large collection of Visual Materials (Boxes 2-4 and oversize folder). Helen Blair made at least one of the scrapbooks, "Old Homes," a recollection of her early life in Jackson, Michigan. This has been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Other scrapbooks, comprised of photographs, often with captions, and newspaper clippings, had been unbound and the original order is uncertain. There are five generations represented in the visual materials and most of the people and places in the photographs, glass plate negatives, tintypes, daguerreotypes and ambrotypes have been identified; some have been dated. Places, particularly the Austin Blair house in Jackson, the Blair's summer place on Portage Lake, and the pineapple plantations in Florida are well documented. This series provides a rich visual context in which to read the textual materials.</p>
