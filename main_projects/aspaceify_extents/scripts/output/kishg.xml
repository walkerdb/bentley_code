    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>George Kish was an internationally acclaimed professor of geography at the University of Michigan, where he served for over fifty years. He was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1914. His education began in Hungary where he graduated from secondary school summa cum laude and won the national competition in geography. He then moved to Paris, where he studied political science, geography, and history, the latter two at the Sorbonne. Returning to Hungary, he received both a M.S. in Economics in 1938 and a D.Sc. in Geography in 1939 at the University of Budapest.</p>
      <p>Kish came to America in 1939 to continue his studies in geography at the University of Michigan, where he received his Ph.D. in 1945. During the Second World War, he acted as a translator of Hungarian newspapers for the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, he returned to the U-M where he remained for fifty years, beginning as a research assistant and moving to full professor in 1956. In between, he was a teaching fellow (1940-1943) and map curator at the Clements Library (1944-1946). Originally his last name was spelled "Kiss," but on becoming a United State citizen in the late 1940s, it was Americanized to "Kish," to reflect its accurate pronunciation in Hungarian. Kish gained international acclaim as a geographer and was an active participant in his profession, especially in the subfield of political geography.</p>
      <p>As an expert in his field, Kish was sought out for visiting positions by other institutions, including Northwestern University, Oxford University, London School of Economics, University of Warsaw, and the University of Tel-Aviv. Awarded Fulbrights in the early 1950s and mid-1960s, he taught in Italy both times. In 1980, he was named the Kenneth Nebenzahl, Jr. Lecturer in the History of Cartography at the Newberry Library in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Kish was active in professional societies and organizations, such as the Association of American Geographers and the International Geographical Union (IGU). In the IGU, he served as chairperson for many of its committees and commissions, such as the United States National Committee and the Commission on Old Maps. He also helped found the Commission on the History of Geographical Thought for the IGU. Kish was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies and served on its board of directors during the 1960s.</p>
      <p>Besides holding various visiting professorships, he traveled the world over to conduct research for his many books and articles. To learn more about the noted Swedish explorers A. E. Nordenskiold and Sven Hedin, he traveled to Sweden to examine records of their lives. While there, he received two prestigious awards: the Andree Medal for Polar Studies from the Swedish Geographical Society and the Linnaeus Medal for Studies in the History of Science from the Royal Swedish Academy of Science. Kish's books and articles were published in many languages and printed in journals around the world.</p>
      <p>Kish was also active closer to home. He supported his home university and participated in the life of the University of Michigan. In 1975, he received the honor of being named to give the Henry Russel Lecture. In 1981, Kish became the William Herbert Hobbs professor of Geography after the Geography Department was discontinued in that year. He took an interest in university life and was on several University Senate committees, including the College of Literature, Sciences, and Arts Library Committee. He was president of the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra from 1972 to 1974 and president of the Michigan Orchestra Association from 1977 to 1979. He was also president of the Michigan Map Society in 1983 and 1984.</p>
      <p>Kish married Elvina Anger, M.D., in 1949, a union that brought forth one daughter. Kish made his home in Ann Arbor for the last fifty years of his life and continued teaching at the university, following his retirement in 1984, until his death in July 1989.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The George Kish papers are divided into eight series: Correspondence, Subject Folders, Professional Societies, Geography Courses, Reprints, Manuscripts, Notes as a Student, and Photographs. These eight sections correspond, more or less, to the order that Kish maintained for his own files. The collection documents the academic career of Kish, from his Paris days as a student and his years at the U-M as a professor to his retirement and beyond. The collection's focus is not strictly on the university, as it also reflects Kish's prolific writings and his work in professional societies.</p>

          <p>Correspondence covers a fifty-year span from 1939 to 1989, a period during which Kish was usually at the University of Michigan. The files are arranged as Kish had them, first by groups of years, then, within each group, alphabetically. For example, the folders for 1961 to 1966 are comprised of an alphabetical run of correspondence for those six years. Throughout the correspondence there are letters in the many languages in which Kish communicated. These include (in order of frequency): English, Italian, French, German, Swedish, Hungarian, Spanish, and Russian. This section is mostly general correspondence from both individuals and organizations.</p>

          <p>Subject Files contains both correspondence and other materials ordered into one alphabetical sequence. Subjects covered in this section include conferences (documenting Kish's involvement in the planning of and his attendance at), correspondence with publishers, and other topics. Under the sub-heading "Personal," some of Kish's private life is revealed, especially his becoming a United States citizen and his retirement from the U-M. While Kish was in Sweden conducting research for his biography of A. E. Nordenskiold, his secretary kept fairly complete records for him of events in Ann Arbor. This is found in the "Sweden to Ann Arbor Office" folder. Both Kish's life and interests can be glimpsed by glancing through the headings of the Subject Folders.</p>

          <p>In the Professional Societies series, the researcher will find documentation about Kish's involvement with the Association of American Geographers (AAG), the American Geographical Union (AGU), and International Geographical Union (IGU). The most extensive records are for the AAG and several of its committees on which Kish served. Kish was a regular contributor to the AGU's Geographical Review. Documented here are his relations with AGU editors, while his contributions will be found in the Reprints series.</p>

          <p>Kish was considered a good teacher by his students, and in the Geography Courses series, his teaching methods are documented. The course files are ordered by course number, with preference given to the most recent number, if known. These materials include both master-copies of exams and lecture notes. Some bibliographies and source-books are also included. There are also some courses where only the title or subject matter is known and these are at the end of the section in alphabetical order.</p>

          <p>Also part of his academic career was writing, and here George Kish seemed to shine the brightest. His writings are represented in two series in the collection: Reprints and Manuscripts. The Reprints series contains some of Kish's writings, but by no means all of them. These are arranged first by publication, then by year in a "Miscellaneous" file.</p>

          <p>Manuscripts consists of several files: "Books and Articles," "Encyclopedia Articles," "Speeches," "Television Scripts," "Unpublished," and "Notes." The first contains some manuscripts for books and journal articles that Kish wrote, showing changes in some of them. The "Speeches" file contains notes and transcripts of several speeches which Kish delivered, including one at the centennial of the National Geographic Society and the 1975 Henry Russel Lecture entitled "Image - Illustration - Instrument: the Map through History." During the 1950s and 1960s, Kish was involved in educational television, and the "Television Scripts" file represents the work that Kish did for educational television. (There are letters of praise scattered throughout the Correspondence section.) One box of the Kish materials was labeled "Unpublished Manuscripts" and all of these have been preserved under that same label.</p>

          <p>The Photographs are negative slide strips used as part of his 1975 Russel lecture on the history of maps; and photographs probably taken or collected while a Fulbright Visiting Professor to various universities in Italy, 1963-1964. There are no personal pictures of Kish and his family.</p>
