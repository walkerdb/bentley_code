    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p><persname>Lawrence K. Rosinger</persname> was born in New York City on October 5, 1915. He received his B.A. in history from the City College of New York in 1932 and a master's degree in Far Eastern studies from Columbia University in 1936. From 1937 to 1941, Rosinger taught history and civilizations courses in New York high schools, and from 1941 to 1942, he worked as assistant to the India Government Trade Commissioner. Rosinger worked as a research associate with the Foreign Policy Association from 1941 to 1942. During this same period, he was awarded two visiting lectureships by Columbia and the University of California-Berkeley.</p>
      <p>In 1946, Rosinger made his first trip to China. Traveling as a correspondent for the Foreign Policy Association and also representing several other American publications, he had an excellent opportunity to gather firsthand information. During his trip, he traveled some 5,000 miles by train, car, ship and even on horseback within China. He visited Shanghai, Peiping (Beijing), Yenan, the Yellow River area, and Manchuria. He interviewed more than two dozen Chinese Communist leaders and some third-party spokesmen, as well as high-ranking officials of the Nationalist Party. By the late 1940s, he had established himself as an expert in the field of Far Eastern studies. In 1948 he began to work as a research associate for the American Institute of Pacific Relations.</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, Rosinger was a highly respected expert in Far Eastern studies. He was consulted regularly by the U.S. State Department regarding China and Far Eastern policies. He was a prolific writer. Besides six books, four on China, and two on India, he also wrote more than one hundred articles, book reviews, and radio broadcasts. He was also a very active public speaker. While working for the American Foreign Policy Association and the American Institute for Pacific Relations, he gave numerous talks to organizations each year.</p>
      <p>After the Chinese Communist Party took power in 1949, and especially after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Rosinger came under attack from right-wing supporters of Senator Joseph McCarthy in Congress for his allegedly pro-Communist views. In testimony before the McCarran Committee, a subcommittee in charge of investigating pro-Communist activities, Rosinger defended his position as a scholar of Chinese studies and his work with the American Institute of Pacific Relations.</p>
      <p>In 1952, to remove himself from further political persecution, Rosinger moved to Detroit, Michigan. He first worked as a hardware store manager in Detroit and then taught at Henry Ford Community College for over twenty years. In 1973, Rosinger made his second trip to China with his wife Lillian Rosinger and five other Americans. For twenty-five days, they traveled as tourists, visiting such places as Canton (Guangzhou), Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chengzhou, Sian, Yenan and Beijing. In Beijing, Rosinger interviewed Marshall Ye Jianying, head of China's armed forces and one of the six top leaders of the country.</p>
      <p>Rosinger retired in the early 1980s and died in 1994. He was survived by his wife, Lillian Rosinger, his son and daughter.</p>

          <p>The first trip to <geogname>China</geogname> series contains nearly 300 <genreform>black and white photographs</genreform> taken in <geogname>China</geogname>, notes and <genreform>transcripts</genreform> of more than two dozen <genreform>interviews</genreform> conducted with the <subject>Chinese Communist leaders</subject>, third party spokesmen, and high-ranking <subject>Nationalist Party officials.</subject> In those notes, one can find important <genreform>biographical information</genreform> of some <subject>Chinese Communist leaders</subject> that Rosinger interviewed, <genreform>statistics of the population</genreform> in the " <subject>Liberated Area</subject>" (<subject>Chinese Communist-controlled area</subject>), and the <corpname>Chinese Communist Party</corpname> members.</p>
          <p>Most of Rosinger's <genreform>interviews</genreform> took place during his visit to <geogname>Yenan</geogname> (July 21-August 1); some occurred in <geogname>Shanghai</geogname>, <geogname>Nanking</geogname> (now <geogname>Nanjing</geogname>), <geogname>Peiping</geogname> (now <geogname>Peijing</geogname>) and <geogname>Tsaochow</geogname> (now <geogname>Chaochou</geogname>). Among those interviews, the two lengthy interviews with <persname>Mao Tse-tung</persname> and with <persname>Chou En-lai</persname> are probably the most valuable. Also of interest is Rosinger's interview with <persname>Jao Sou-Shih</persname>, a high-ranking <corpname>Chinese Communist Party</corpname> official who was later purged by <persname>Mao Tse-tung</persname>. The subject matter of these interviews primarily focuses on <subject>political, economic and military developments</subject> in the period of the <subject>Nationalist-Communist coalition</subject>.</p>
          <p>Another interesting document in this series is a <genreform>letter</genreform> dated May 6, 1946, from <persname>Dr. L. Peng</persname> a professor at the <corpname>Academia Sinica</corpname>. In this long <genreform>letter</genreform> (34 pages), <persname>Dr. Peng</persname> discusses the <subject>political situation</subject> in <geogname>China</geogname>, and provided a sense of general resentment to the <corpname>Nationalist Party</corpname> among the <subject>Chinese intellectuals</subject> and a strong hope for peace among the masses.</p>

          <p>The second trip to <geogname>China</geogname> series contains Rosinger's <genreform>travel notes</genreform>, descriptions of images probably to accompany a slide presentation, six rolls of films, and more than 200 <genreform>black and white photographs</genreform>. Of interest is Rosinger's interview with <persname>Marshall Ye Jianying</persname>. The interview was scheduled to be 45 minutes long, but it actually turned out to be an hour and a half. In this lengthy interview, Ye touched upon many important issues on <subject>Sino-U.S. relations</subject> as well as <subject>world politics</subject>. Rosinger was one of the few Americans who were granted a visa to enter <geogname>China</geogname> at that time, and certainly one of the handful of American scholars who had the opportunity to meet with a high-ranking Chinese leader like <persname>Ye Jianying</persname>.</p>
