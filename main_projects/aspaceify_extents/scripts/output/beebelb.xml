      <p>Lorraine Beebe, neé Boekeloo, was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan. She graduated from Western Michigan University (BS 1932) and took graduate classes at Wayne State University (MS 1946) and the University of Michigan. After graduating from Western Michigan, Mrs. Beebe worked for the city of Kalamazoo for three years as an assistant city recreation director. In 1937 she moved to Dearborn, Michigan, and accepted the position of director of girl's and women's recreational activities. While working in Dearborn, Mrs. Beebe met her husband, Mr. Leo Beebe, who later became a Ford Motor Company executive. Mr. and Mrs. Beebe, who were divorced in the mid-1960's, had two children, Peter and Anne.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Beebe was active in community affairs and education in the 1950's and 1960's. She was the first woman appointed to the Dearborn recreation commission; served as chairman and a member of the Advisory Board of the Dearborn chapter of the American Red Cross; guided the activities of the Youth Fellowship and Christian Education at the Christ Episcopal Church in Dearborn; taught and counseled students at Dearborn High School; and was a psychology instructor at Henry Ford Community College.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Beebe has been interested and active in political causes for many years. She served as the chairman of Eisenhower's 1956 fund raising campaign in Dearborn and was a delegate to the 1964 Michigan Republican State Convention in Grand Rapids. Her first attempt to gain public office was an unsuccessful primary election for a Michigan state senate seat in 1964. She ran again for the state senate in 1966 and won both the Republican primary and the general election beating incumbent Democrat Edward J. Robinson. In the state senate, Mrs. Beebe was the first woman elected assistant majority leader. She chaired the Health, Social Services, and Retirement Committee, was vice chair of the Highways Committee, and was a member of the Labor Committee. She also served on numerous interim and special committees and commissions.</p>
      <p>Senator Beebe, the only woman in the Michigan Senate, felt she represented both her senatorial district and the women of Michigan. The campaign to reform Michigan's abortion law became one of her primary concerns. In a speech before the Senate in 1969 during the abortion debate, Senator Beebe told the chamber of the therapeutic abortion she underwent years earlier. As a result of this speech, Senator Beebe gained national recognition and became a leading spokesperson for the pro-choice movement. Her pro-choice stance on the abortion issue was a major reason for her defeat in 1970.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Beebe's commitment to political activity did not end with her Senate defeat. She was appointed to numerous Federal and State commissions and committees during the 1970's and was a much sought after consultant and lecturer on issues such as abortion, consumerism, women's issues, and political action. Mrs. Beebe was a member of the President's Committee on Mental Retardation (1970-1980); the Indian Affairs and National Inter-Agency Council (1972-1975); the Michigan Women's Council (1972-1978, chairwoman, 1972-1975); the Michigan Consumer Council (Executive Director, 1972-1974); the Michigan Criminal Justice Commission (1973-1976); the Advisory Council to the Michigan Indian Commission (chairperson, 1973-1975); the Michigan Society for Mental Health (Board Member, 1973-1975); the Michigan Health Council (1972-1976); and the Parole and Review Board, Michigan Office of Youth Services (Vice Chairperson).</p>
      <p>Mrs. Beebe moved from Dearborn to Portage, Michigan, in 1977 where she continued working with various political movements. During the 1980 presidential campaign, she worked on behalf of the National Unity Campaign of John B. Anderson. She was nominated by Michigan National Unity Convention to run as Vice-President on Anderson's Michigan ticket. She withdrew her name when Anderson named former Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey as his vice presidential choice. During the 1980 campaign, Mrs. Beebe served as the Michigan State Coordinator for the Anderson ticket.</p>
