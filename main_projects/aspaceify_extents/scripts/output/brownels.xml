      <abstract>Samuel Miller Brownell was an educator and school administrator who served as U.S. Commissioner of Education from 1953-1956 and as Superintendent of Detroit Public Schools from 1956 to 1966. He was married to Esther Delzell Brownell, who taught high school history before their 1927 marriage. This collection documents the Brownells’ family life, and to a lesser extent, Samuel M. Brownell’s career. Materials include a large collection of correspondence between Samuel and Esther Brownell, personal papers reflecting the family’s social and cultural activities and daily life, and a series of scrapbooks, dating from 1900 to 1988, containing photographs, clippings, newsletters, correspondence, and ephemera. The older scrapbooks provide information about the early lives of both of the Brownells, and later scrapbooks document the family’s vacations and Samuel Brownell’s career as an educator, administrator, and political appointee.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Samuel Miller Brownell was born in 1900 in Peru, Nebraska. He received his B.A. from the University of Nebraska in 1921, his M.A. from Yale University in 1924, and his Ph.D. from Yale in 1926. Brownell was an educator, administrator, and consultant in the field of urban educational administration. His first professional post was at the New York State College of Teachers. From 1927 to 1938, he was Superintendent of Schools in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. In 1938, he joined the faculty of Yale as a professor of educational administration. From 1947 to 1953, he was President of New Haven State Teacher's College, concurrent with his work at Yale. He resigned both positions when he was appointed U.S. Commissioner of Education by President Eisenhower in 1953. His brother, Herbert Brownell, also worked for the Eisenhower administration, serving as U.S. Attorney General from 1953 to 1957. In 1956, Samuel Brownell left Washington to become Superintendent of Detroit Public Schools. He returned to New Haven in 1966, where he held a joint position at Yale and the University of Connecticut. He retired in 1973. In the mid 1970s, he served as a consultant for Development &amp; Resources Corporation, which conducted the Iran Public Sector Management Program, a diagnostic review of Iran’s public sector. Brownell died in 1990.</p>
      <p>Esther Delzell Brownell was born in 1902 in Syracuse, Nebraska. Her family moved to Peru, Nebraska in 1905. She attended Peru State Normal School for her primary and secondary education, graduating with a B.A. in English and Education in 1923. After graduation, she taught history at the high school level until her marriage to Samuel Brownell in 1927. The Brownells had four children: Richard, born in 1930, Dorothy, in 1932, Jane, in 1937, and Ruth, in 1944. Esther Brownell was active in a number of social and philanthropic organizations. She was a life-long member of P.E.O., a philanthropic educational organization; and while living in Detroit, she served on the Women’s Committee of the United Community Services and the Board of Directors of the YWCA; and she was a sponsor for students visiting the U.S. through the American Field Service’s international scholarship program. Esther Brownell died a year after her husband, in 1991.</p>

      <p>The Samuel Miller Brownell and Esther Delzell Brownell collection documents the family life of two individuals from their courtship through their old age. To a lesser extent, the career of Samuel Brownell as educator is also documented. The papers are arranged roughly chronologically into three series, beginning with the lives of each of the Brownells before their marriage, and then following them as they moved from Nebraska to Michigan, to Connecticut, to Washington, D.C., to Michigan again, and finally to back to Connecticut.</p>

          <p>The Samuel Miller Brownell Papers date from 1909 to 1989, and document some of his professional activities and his personal life prior to his marriage. This series includes a significant number of letters Brownell received from Esther Delzell during their courtship. The letters, which are very frequent, discuss Delzell’s daily activities, her social life, her family, and her work as a teacher. The letters offer a glimpse of the life of a young working woman in the 1920s. Other items in this series are a postcard from Brownell to his grandmother, Mrs. Samuel Miller, a dramatization of Silas Marner written by Brownell, a letter noting his discharge from the Student’s Army Training Corps in 1918, Brownell’s curriculum vitae, and several photographs. The series also includes essays by Brownell on the subject of school administration, papers documenting his work as a consultant on the Iran Public Sector Management Program, and a catalog of the books Brownell donated to Southern Connecticut State University.</p>

          <p>The bulk of the Esther Delzell Papers is made up of letters from Samuel Brownell. His letters, written while he was at Yale, and later at the New York State College for Teachers at Albany, describe the completion of his Ph.D. and the beginnings of his professional career. The letters, written nearly every day, are loving and often funny. They provide a good sense of his day to day experiences and demonstrate his focus on his new career. Other materials in this series include Delzell’s diary, kept between 1915 and 1917, a few items relating to her education and teaching post, and letters and cards from friends, 1917-1927.</p>

          <p>The Brownell Family Papers is the largest series in the collection, and has been divided into eight subseries: Correspondence; five separate subseries for each of the family's places of residence, Grosse Pointe (1927-1937), New Haven (1937-1954), Washington, D.C. (1954-1956), Detroit (1956-1966), and New Haven (1966-1991); a subseries of scrapbooks and photographs albums; and a subseries of Calendars and School Records.</p>

            <p>Correspondence includes letters exchanged by Samuel and Esther Brownell, letters written by both Brownells to family members, and letters and cards received from friends. Like the letters from their courtship period, the letters the Brownells exchanged while they were separated by work or travel, provide details of their family activities, and their work and social involvements.</p>

            <p>The final subseries, Scrapbooks and Photo Albums, contains disbound scrapbook pages from 1900 to 1988. The early scrapbooks, from 1900 to 1927, include ephemera from the school and social lives of both Esther Delzell and Samuel Brownell. From 1927 to 1988, the main emphasis of the scrapbooks becomes Samuel Brownell's career as an educator and administrator, although they also contain photographs and ephemera relating the Brownell family and their friends. The items in the scrapbooks that document Brownell's career include letters received by and copies of letters sent by Brownell; newsletters, brochures, and programs; photographs of Brownell attending conferences, graduation ceremonies, and other events; newspaper clippings about Brownell; clippings of the "Report Card," a Detroit Free Press column written by Brownell in 1961-1962; clippings about Herbert Brownell's political career; and various invitations and ephemera.</p>
            <p>The Scrapbooks and Photo Albums subseries also includes a disbound photo album entitled "The Schools that Sam Built," showing images of elementary, middle, and high school buildings in the Detroit Public School system; a packet of reports and agendas from a meeting of the Inter-American Ministers of Education, held in Lima, Peru in 1956; a scrapbook from a trip taken by the wives of Eisenhower administration Cabinet members in 1956 (this trip included the Brownells' sister-in-law, Doris Brownell); and photos from the dedication of a portrait of Brownell at Southern Connecticut State College in 1974.</p>
            <p>The travel scrapbooks are well annotated, and include photos, postcards, maps, and ephemera documenting the family’s travels around North American and abroad. This subseries also includes disbound photo albums and commemorative volumes related to Brownell’s roles as school superintendent, Commissioner of Education, and educational consultant.</p>
