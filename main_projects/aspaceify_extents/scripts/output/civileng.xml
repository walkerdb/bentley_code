      <abstract>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering is a unit within the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan. The records span from 1908 to 2001 with the bulk of the material being from 1960-1998. The records cover a variety of topics, including documentation from the Alumni Association, Chi Epsilon chapter, faculty meeting minutes, and annual reports from the administration.</abstract>

      <p>In 1853, Alexander Winchell was the first appointed Professor of Physics and Civil Engineering at the University of Michigan under the Department of Literature, Science and Art. In 1855, Professor William Peck became the second appointed as Professor of Civil Engineering. In the field of civil engineering, the first class, consisting of two men, graduated in 1860. In 1895, the College of Engineering was established as a separate entity from the College of Literature, Science, and Arts.</p>
      <p>Within the College of Engineering was established the Department of Civil Engineering and Gardner Williams was appointed Professor of Civil Engineering. In 1904, the West Engineering Building was opened and the Department of Civil Engineering moved most of its operations to this site. In 1912, Henry Riggs was appointed the head of the Department of Civil Engineering. Riggs set up five specific divisions within the Department of Civil Engineering. They were Civil Engineering, Geodesy and Surveying, Hydraulic Engineering, Municipal and Sanitary Engineering, and Structural Engineering. In 1921, the Division of Geodesy and Surveying became its own department, and in 1922 the Division of Transportation Engineering was established. Lewis Gram became head of the department in 1928. In 1936, the Division of Hygiene and Public Health was established in the department. However, this division was later absorbed into the School of Public Health in 1941. At the same time, the Department of Geodesy and Surveying returned to the Department of Civil Engineering. Earnest Boyce became the head of the department in 1947. By 1949, the department had 369 undergraduate students enrolled, and 114 graduate students. During this year, the Michigan chapter of Chi Epsilon, the Civil Engineering Honors Society, was established.</p>
      <p>In 1962, Frank Richart was appointed head of the department. The department was forced to revise its curricula in 1967 when the College of Engineering lowered the amount of credit hours required for undergraduates. In 1976, Robert Hanson was appointed head of the department. 1978 saw the discontinuation of both the Transportation Institute and the Division of Geodesy and Surveying within the department.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the department expanded its name to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and began offering a new undergraduate degree in environmental engineering. In 2013, the <title render="italic">U.S. World and News Report</title> ranked both the undergraduate and graduate programs in environmental engineering as 4th in their respective categories, and the programs in civil engineering ranked 8th and 7th respectively.</p>

Material details activities and networking. The Friends Association's main purpose is to promote relations between alumni and other students and engineers. As such, the dealings of the Alumni Association often overlapped with the Friends Association.</p>
