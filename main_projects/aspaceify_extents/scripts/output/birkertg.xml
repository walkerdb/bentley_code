    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Gunnar Birkerts is an internationally acclaimed architect of the last half of the twentieth century who has been recognized for his expressive forms, his simplification of detail, his innovative work with surface materials and his effective use of indirect daylight. With his design flexibility and commitment to "finding poetry in building technology," he has pushed beyond the boundaries of the Modern Movement. [1]</p>
      <p>Born on January 17, 1925, in Riga, Latvia, Gunnar Birkerts' childhood was steeped in the mythology of his country, as both of his parents, Peteris and Merija Shop Birkerts, were scholars and folklorists who studied the cultural heritage of the Latvian people. Later in his career, Birkerts expressed his gratitude for the rich, architectural and literary images of his homeland which he believed continued to stimulate his creative process.</p>
      <p>While attending the first gymnasium in Riga, Birkerts saw an architectural rendering of an upperclassman which inspired him at the age of thirteen to pursue a career in this field. He completed two degrees in engineering and architecture in 1949 at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, where his training exposed him to both Bauhaus and vernacular design. His education in the craft and technology program gave him an understanding of architectural materials and design construction methodology, which would become enduring interests throughout his career.</p>
      <p>During his training, Gunnar Birkerts studied the work of Alvar Aalto, Gunnar Asplund, Sven Markelius and Sigurd Lewerentz in Europe and that of Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn and Marcel Breuer, who had emigrated to the United States. William Lescaze and Frank Lloyd Wright were also of interest to him. However, it was at the U.S. Information Agency Library that he discovered and became attracted to the modern architecture of Eliel and Eero Saarinen with whom he shared northern European roots. Thus, he came to Birmingham, Michigan in December 1949 to seek work with Eero Saarinen, who explained to him upon his arrival in Birmingham, Michigan, that the General Motors Technical Center project was on hold and that no job was available for him. Carrying a letter of recommendation from Saarinen, Birkerts went to Chicago to join the firm of Perkins and Will, which specialized in school architecture. Within a year of his arrival in the United States, he married Sylvia Zvirbulis. Together they had three children, Sven Peter, Andra Sylvia and Erik Gunnar, born in 1951, 1954 and 1967, respectively.</p>
      <p>In 1951, Eero Saarinen invited Birkerts to join his firm in Birmingham, Michigan, where he worked with such young architects as Kevin Roche, Robert Venturi and John Dinkeloo. During his four years with Saarinen, he contributed to the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan and Concordia Senior College in Fort Wayne, Indiana and was the project architect for the Milwaukee County War Memorial. In 1954, he won the young Designer of the Year Award from the Akron Museum of Art. Birkerts was highly impressed by Saarinen's inventiveness and perseverance, qualities which he carried into his own work. He recalls that "in those days it was a battle to bring modern architecture to the world. The whole quest was evangelistic." [2]</p>
      <p>Birkerts received American citizenship in 1955, shortly after leaving Saarinen's office to join Donald Grieb in Milwaukee. After one year with Grieb, he was invited by Minoru Yamasaki to work with Yamasaki, Leinweber and Associates, in Birmingham, Michigan. There he was chief designer for the Reynolds Metals Building, the Educational Building at Wayne State University and the Daharan Air Terminal between 1956 and 1959. During this time, he received a number of design awards, including two citations from <title render="italic">Progressive Architecture</title> for houses in Wisconsin and first prize in the Cantu, Italy First International Furniture Competition. He was especially proud of the latter because Alvar Aalto, highly esteemed by Birkerts, was one of the jurists.</p>
      <p>In 1959, Birkerts became a principal of Minoru Yamasaki and Associates. Despite his admiration for Yamasaki's intuitive creation process, Birkerts thought, "I had listened long enough. My apprenticeship was over. Now it was my turn to speak."[3] Accordingly, he left Yamasaki in 1959 to establish the partnership of Birkerts and Straub. With Frank Straub as project administrator and Birkerts as designer, they produced their first independent projects, including the Schwartz Summer Residence (1960-1962) in Northville, Michigan, the Haley Funeral Home (1960-1961) in Southfield, Michigan, the 1300 Lafayette East Apartments (1961-1963) in Detroit, the Marathon Oil Office Building (1962-1964) in Detroit and the Lillibridge Elementary School Addition (1962-1963) in Detroit.</p>
      <p>Birkerts began his twenty-nine-year teaching career at the University of Michigan at this time as well. In 1961, he was appointed assistant professor of architecture, becoming associate professor of architecture in 1963 and professor of architecture in 1969. He was awarded the position of professor emeritus in 1990.</p>
      <p>Gunnar Birkerts and Associates was established in 1963 in Birmingham, Michigan, when the architect left his partnership with Frank Straub. The 1960s were prolific years for the practice, as Birkerts designed buildings which contained the "bold forms, space before structure, minimal detailing, stratified walls and daylight in interior spaces"[4] which were the hallmarks of his work during this decade. Among his many important buildings of this period were the University Reformed Church (1960-1964) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the Detroit Institute of Arts - South Wing Addition (1964), the Fisher Administrative Center (1964-1966) at the University of Detroit, the Lincoln Elementary School (1965-1967) in Columbus, Indiana, the Freeman Residence (1964-1966) in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Tougaloo College Campus Master Plan (1965) in Tougaloo, Mississippi, the Tougaloo College Dormitories and Library (1966-1972) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (1967-1973).</p>
      <p>During the 1970s, Birkerts continued his exploration of glass and metal as surface technologies. He was also an early advocate for the containment of urban sprawl with his Subterranean Urban Systems Study of 1974, for which he received a Fellowship Grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. In 1970, he was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and he received a Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects, Detroit, in 1975. He was also honored by an appointment as Architect in Residence at the American Academy in Rome in 1976. A few of his many notable buildings of this decade are the Contemporary Arts Museum (1970-1972) in Houston, the Dance Instructional Facility (1970-1976) at the State University of New York, Purchase, the University of Michigan Law School Addition (1974-1981) in Ann Arbor, the United States Embassy Office Building (1975, project) in Helsinki, Finland, the Duluth Public Library (1969-1980), the Museum of Glass (1976-1980) in Corning, New York, and the University of Iowa College of Law Building (1979-1986) in Iowa City.</p>
      <p>Birkerts received many more awards in the 1980s and 1990s, including the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize in Architecture from The American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1981) and the first Bruce Alonzo Goff Professorship of Creative Architecture (1990) at the University of Oklahoma. In a poll conducted by The Buildings Journal of 58 architecture academicians in 1982, Gunnar Birkerts was listed as one of the top ten architects of non-residential structures in the nation, along with I. M. Pei, Romaldo Giurgola, Cesar Pelli, Kevin Roche, Philip Johnson, Michael Graves, Charles Moore, Edward Larrabee Barnes and Richard Meier. Among his important buildings of this period are the Ferguson Residence (1980-1983) in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the Cornell University Uris Library Addition (1980-1982) in Ithaca, New York, the Conservatory of Music Library Addition (1986-1988) in Oberlin, Ohio, and the United States Embassy Office Building (1987-89) in Caracas, Venezuela.</p>
      <p>In 1997, Birkerts dissolved Gunnar Birkerts and Associates. He is continuing his practice of architecture from his studio in Bloomfield Hills. Now in the fifth decade of his prolific career, Birkerts is designing the Joint Library of the City of San Jose and San Jose State University in California, the first institution in the country to combine the repositories of a university and a city under one roof. Such other recent works as the Ohio State University College of Law Addition (1988-1993) in Columbus, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art and Design (1991-1994) of the Kansas City Art Institute, and the National Library (1989 - in progress) in Riga, Latvia are testament to the innovation, monumentality and freedom of Birkerts' "expressive architecture."[5] The National Library exemplifies Birkerts' powerful use of metaphor which has characterized his work throughout his career and has made his buildings among the most distinctive of the twentieth century.</p>

      <p>The Gunnar Birkerts Collection offers researchers the opportunity to study the personal, professional and faculty papers and conceptual sketches of one of the masters of American modern architecture, whose career spans the second half of the twentieth century. The collection encompasses 11 linear feet of Birkerts' student work, notes and transcripts of speeches, lectures and interviews, video and audio tapes, writings, correspondence, awards, travel diaries, academic course materials, photographs and project records. Perhaps the greatest significance of this collection lies in its presentation of over 1900 drawings of 122 buildings and projects by the architect's own hand, many of which are valuable, early conceptual sketches.</p>
      <p>In its pairing of narrative and visual documents, the Gunnar Birkerts Collection offers a rich perspective on the architect himself, illuminating his views on the creative process and the resulting conceptual designs which have defined his expressive architecture over his illustrious fifty-plus-year career. The Gunnar Birkerts Collection is the architect's deeply personal legacy. He recognizes that, while some of his buildings may be demolished over time, his original conceptual designs on paper are conserved here for future generations to study and enjoy. To this end, he has endowed the Gunnar Birkerts Collection to ensure that his drawings will be preserved and that his place in architectural history can be studied and understood.</p>
      <p>The Gunnar Birkerts Collection is comprised of four series: Personal Papers, Professional Papers, Faculty Papers and Project Records. The narrative and visual documents in these series illuminate the full breadth of the architect's life and work, from his early years as a student at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, Germany in the 1940s to his career in Michigan as an internationally acclaimed architect, esteemed design professor and global lecturer from the early 1950s to the present.</p>

          <p>The Personal Papers consists of a small biographical file compiled by Birkerts and his wife, Birkert's first architectural drawings; his student notebooks and drawings,; and a small group of family photographs. Birkerts first two architectural drawings, renderings of a gas station and house, produced when he was 17 years of age, document his early understanding of modern architecture in 1942. The course notebooks and project drawings, completed while Birkerts was a student at the Technische Hochschule from 1944 to 1949, illuminate the educational foundation of his architectural career and show his incipient interest in furniture as well as building design. Two important photographs of Birkerts with his mother in Riga at the ages of four and five are also found in this series.</p>

          <p>The Professional Papers series encompasses nine subseries relating to Birkerts' career accomplishments as an architect, lecturer and writer over a 50-year period. These subseries include Transcripts and Notes of Speeches, Lectures and Seminars, Transcripts of Interviews, Audio-Visual Materials which correspond to many of the transcripts, Writings, Publications, Correspondence, Awards and Honorary Academic Affiliations, Travel Diaries with Conceptual Drawings, Newspaper and Journal Articles, and Photographs.</p>

            <p>Within the large Professional Papers series, the Transcripts and Notes of Speeches, Lectures and Seminars subseries contains materials related to over 150 presentations given by Birkerts during his career. These transcripts and notes document Birkerts' professional and artistic beliefs, design philosophy and creative process. The subseries is arranged in three further sub-subseries describing the venues of Birkerts' presentations: Academic, Professional and Public, and Dedications. The Academic sub-subseries contains speaking notes and transcripts of the speeches and lectures given by Birkerts to students and faculty at various academic institutions. The Professional and Public sub-subseries includes similar material for addresses given by Birkerts to his professional colleagues as well as to the general public. Comments made by Birkerts at the dedications of a few of the buildings which he designed make up the Dedications sub-subseries. Researchers should note that specific building projects tend to be mentioned in the speeches and lectures occurring between the times of a building's design and completion. For example, Domino's Farms is discussed quite frequently in lectures given from 1984 through 1985. These three sub-subseries contain lectures which can be heard on corresponding audiotapes or videotapes (marked with an * or a #), which are listed in the Audio-Visual Materials subseries. The researcher should also be aware that additional lectures and speeches can be found in the Sources Used for Publication subseries.</p>

            <p>The second sub-series within the Professional Papers series, Transcripts of Interviews, relates to interviews given by Birkerts from 1982 to 2000. The interviews tend to focus on his professional career, his design philosophy and creative process, or a particular project on which he was working at the time. Some of the interviews (noted by an *) can be heard on the corresponding audiotapes, which are listed in the Audio-Visual Materials subseries. The researcher should be aware that additional interviews can be found in the Sources Used for Publication subseries.</p>

            <p>The Writings subseries within the Professional Papers series contains a few of Birkerts' many writings. Some of the pieces relate to specific buildings (particularly the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Domino's Farms), while others deal with concepts such as design methodology and the "architecture of response." Also included are a few pieces of Birkerts' poetry about his architecture, as well as an article he wrote about Alvar Aalto.</p>

            <p>The Correspondence subseries within the Professional Papers series contains voluminous documentation of Birkerts' appearances as a guest lecturer or professor at universities and professional conferences. These letters demonstrate the architect's personal commitment to educating students across the country and to his immense popularity as a speaker to diverse, international audiences. Correspondence regarding his participation on architectural competition juries and in exhibitions of his own work is also included here. Within the sub-subseries General Correspondence, a number of letters from other famous architects and engineers, such as Robert Venturi, Cesar Pelli and Leslie Robertson (structural engineer for many of Birkerts' buildings and for Minoru Yamasaki's World Trade Center), can be found. In addition, letters from students of all ages and professors and architects from around the world show the breadth of Birkerts' influence in architectural design.</p>

            <p>The seventh subseries within the Professional Papers series, Awards and Honorary Academic Affiliations, ranges from his first "Young Designers" award by the Akron Art Institute in 1954 to his 2000 American Architecture Award from The Chicago Athenaeum for his National Library of Latvia. Correspondence associated with the prestigious Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize, awarded by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1981, may be of particular interest to researchers. In addition, awards given to the firm of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates by the AIA and other institutions for individual buildings are all testimony to the architect's impact on modern design in the last half of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first.</p>

            <p>The Travel Diaries with Conceptual Drawings subseries is especially noteworthy for giving the researcher insight into the spontaneous daily writings, musings and drawings of the architect while on the road visiting projects around the world. Handwritten and sometimes in his native Latvian language, these notebooks give the reader a sense of how Birkerts interacted with clients and associates while traveling. The tiny conceptual drawings on the pages of these diaries represent the spontaneity of his creative process, as he sought solutions to design problems on a train or plane. The volumes are arranged chronologically, with the notes and drawings for particular building projects indicated in the finding aid. The travel diaries contained in Box 11 were deemed by Birkerts to be too personal to be accessible to the public at the present time and thus are restricted for 50 years until 2033 to 2045.</p>

            <p>The Travel Diaries with Conceptual Drawings subseries is especially noteworthy for giving the researcher insight into the spontaneous daily writings, musings and drawings of the architect while on the road visiting projects around the world. Handwritten and sometimes in his native Latvian language, these notebooks give the reader a sense of how Birkerts interacted with clients and associates while traveling. The tiny conceptual drawings on the pages of these diaries represent the spontaneity of his creative process, as he sought solutions to design problems on a train or plane. The volumes are arranged chronologically, with the notes and drawings for particular building projects indicated in the finding aid. The travel diaries contained in Box 11 were deemed by Birkerts to be too personal to be accessible to the public at the present time and thus are restricted for 50 years until 2033 to 2045.</p>

            <p>The last two subseries within the Professional Papers series are Newspaper and Journal Articles Regarding Birkerts' Work and Career, 1960-1997 and Photographs, 1955-2000. Through news reporting, written critique and photographic image, we see the changing face of the architect and his work over a 45-year span of his professional career. The newspaper and journal articles from as far away as Toronto, Riga, Rome and Saudi Arabia document the evolution of Birkerts' firm as well as his ideas about architectural design, city planning and the conceptual framework for many of his buildings. Included are critiques by Kay Kaiser of <title render="italic">The San Diego Union</title> William Marlin of <title render="italic">The Christian Science Monitor</title> and John Gallagher of the <title render="italic">Detroit Free Press</title>. Many newspaper articles about individual projects can also be found within the Project Records series, which houses the narrative records and architectural drawings for 122 buildings.</p>

            <p>The images in the Photographs subseries were taken over five decades of the architect's career and offer us freeze-frame glimpses of Birkerts' life and work. A few of these show him designing diligently at his desk as a 30-year-old in 1955, surrounded by Lady Bird Johnson as well as many of the great modern architects of the twentieth century in Columbus, Indiana in 1967, and consulting with archivists on his drawings at the Bentley Historical Library in 1998. Combined with the written documentation of the architect's life and career, the photographic images contribute to the richness of the Gunnar Birkerts Collection and to our understanding of the man and his work.</p>

          <p>Faculty Papers is the third series of the Gunnar Birkerts Collection. While Birkerts has practiced architecture around the globe for over 50 years, he has also maintained a commitment to educating students as a Professor of Architecture at the University of Michigan for almost 30 years. Here he conducted a design studio from 1963 to 1990, was a frequent and popular lecturer on the campus and was appointed Professor Emeritus of Architecture in 1990. Although his Honors Design Studio applicants' resumes, letters of intent and biographical sketches in this collection have been restricted from access for 75 years until 2047 to 2065 (in Box 11) because they are considered to be student papers, his course registers, syllabi, assignments and related materials are available and document Birkerts' experience in teaching and inspiring students. The course materials, correspondence and newspaper articles relating to his tenure as the University of Oklahoma Bruce Alonzo Goff Professor of Creative Architecture from 1990 to1993 are also included in the Faculty Papers series. Many of the lectures which Birkerts delivered at the University of Michigan and the University of Oklahoma appear in the Transcripts of Speeches and Audio-Visual Materials subseries of the Professional Papers series.</p>

          <p>The Project Records series of the Gunnar Birkerts collection contains the architect's textual files and conceptual drawings associated with 122 of the buildings and projects which he has designed over his 50-plus-year career. Unlike the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection, which houses all of the records and drawings associated with fourteen of his firm's buildings, the Gunnar Birkerts Collection is significant for its highly personal representation of the architect's creative process. This last series in the collection brings together over 1800 sketches in his own hand, many documenting the moment of a building's conception on tracing paper, shirt cardboard or the memo pad of an Italian hotel. In Birkert's words: <blockquote><p>That is the moment that I call the organic synthesis -- when all the factors affecting the personality of the building come together in the right magnitudes and the building starts to grow like a plant. The first drawing isn't necessarily pretty, but after you analyze it you see that everything the building needs is in it because it was created by your mind - which as full of everything you needed to know. Sometimes I call these drawings "blobs," but they are really the representation of my brainwaves. An architecture critic would call them seminal ideas. [Gunnar Birkerts, Gunnar Birkerts: <title render="italic">Process and Expression in Architectural Form</title> (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994), 34.</p></blockquote></p>
          <p>Birkerts' textual and visual project records are arranged by building in chronological order from the time of his association with Eero Saarinen in the 1950s through the turn of the twenty-first century. The conceptual sketches and schematic design and design development drawings in the collection are described individually, and 282 of them are linked in this finding aid to online digital images scanned from 4x5 color transparencies of the original drawings. Researchers can click on the "view image" link next to the descriptions of these drawings in the to access these images of 58 of Birkerts; buildings. This will open an new browser window and display the image stored in the Bentley Historical Library Image Bank. It is also possible to search the Image Bank Directly. Birkerts retained the originals of a number of the conceptual drawings. Descriptions of these items are provided in the contents list with a link to a digital copy.</p>

        <p>Researchers are encouraged to access both the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection and the Gunnar Birkerts Collection at the Bentley Historical Library. When studied together, they give the richest possible picture of the architectural design process, from the ecstatic moment of the conception of a building through the meticulous development of schematic design, design development and construction drawings. The Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection is distinguished from the Gunnar Birkerts Collection by its aggregation of 69 linear feet of the firm's textual records and 7158 drawings which document the design process for 14 of Birkerts' most critically acclaimed buildings. A separate finding aid for the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection can be electronically accessed at www.umich.edu/~bhl/. This should be consulted by those interested in studying the evolution of the design process for the following buildings, which were selected because they represent the significance and diversity of the architect's work:</p>
