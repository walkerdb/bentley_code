      <p>The first curriculum in social work at the University of Michigan was established in 1921. Staff members in sociology developed a curriculum which included background courses in the social sciences and field work. The social work program was legitimized by admission into the Association of Schools of Professional Social Work in 1925. In 1927 the regents of the university authorized a certificate in social work to be awarded to students who completed a year of work experience in addition to the undergraduate degree requirements.</p>
      <p>In response to the demands of the Great Depression and the recommendations of a committee of prominent Detroit citizens and social work educators, the university moved to reorganize its social work curriculum. In 1935, with financial support from the Horace H. and Mary A. Rackham Fund and the McGregor Fund, the University of Michigan Institute of Health and Social Sciences was established, and was later renamed the Institute of Public and Social Administration. The institute was located in Detroit, and Robert W. Kelso, who had worked briefly at the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, was appointed as its director.</p>
      <p>By 1945, faculty members were urging the restructuring of the Institute of Public and Social Administration and the formation of an Institute of Social Work. In order to explore the possibilities, a committee composed of faculty members from Ann Arbor was created to work with Kelso. As a result of their work, the institute remained in Detroit and designed a curriculum to enlarge the technical side of training for work in the general field of social and public welfare. It became the Institute of Social Work and included courses in social case work, group work, community organization, public welfare, research and statistics, administration, and field work.</p>
      <p>In 1950, upon Kelso's retirement, Arthur Dunham served as the institute's acting director. That same year, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University considered merging their social work programs, or expanding one of the programs to handle all graduate education in social work in the Detroit area. After months of negotiation, Wayne State announced plans to strengthen its programs in Detroit, and the University of Michigan to reorganize its social work curriculum. The Institute of Social Work was reconstituted as the School of Social Work under the administrative direction of a dean, and the supervision of a governing faculty of the school. On March 1, 1951, the School of Social Work became the 15th school of the University of Michigan, and operations were transferred from Detroit to Ann Arbor. Fedele F. Fauri was named dean and professor of public welfare administration. He had served as director of the Michigan Department of Social Welfare, and as senior specialist in social welfare and social security of the Legislative Reference Service in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>During the 1950s, the school expanded its curriculum, hired new faculty members, and strengthened its intra-university ties to the social sciences. The curriculum was enlarged to include courses in psychiatric social work, medical social work, and child welfare. Extension programs were also established in Detroit and throughout the state. Several important faculty members joined the school. Plans for the development of a specialization in group work were enhanced by the appointment of Robert Vinter in 1954. His teaching, research, and writing brought national attention to the school for leadership in education in the practice of social group work. Wilbur J. Cohen joined the faculty in 1956. Cohen had been director of Research and Statistics, Social Security Administration, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. He came to the school after twenty-one years of federal service. Intra-university connections were improved in 1953 when an interdisciplinary faculty seminar on the research basis of welfare practice was begun. It was funded by the Russell Sage Foundation and headed by David G. French. The seminar resulted in the creation of a Coordinating Committee on Social Welfare Research chaired by sociology Professor Amos Hawley. This committee developed plans for a program of advanced training and research in social work and the social sciences leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in social work.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s, social work faculty members served in numerous positions of leadership in shaping national and state social welfare policies. Professor Wilbur Cohen was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as chairman of the Task Force on Health and Social Security, and as assistant secretary for legislation of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Under President Lyndon B. Johnson, Cohen was appointed secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dean Fedele Fauri served as a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on Public Welfare of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and was elected president of the American Public Welfare Association in 1966. Robert Vinter worked on the State of Michigan Governor's Task Force on Juvenile Delinquency, and as consultant to President Johnson's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime.</p>
      <p>Curriculum changes, re-accreditation, and expanded enrollment occupied the school in the 1960s. The curriculum was broadened to meet the new demands of the decade and included more emphasis on course work rather than field work. The accreditation review spurred greater faculty-student interaction, as student representatives met with various task forces and served as members of the Curriculum Committee. In 1965 students formed the Student Union, which formalized student participation in school decision-making processes, and granted students seats on several school committees. An emphasis on recruitment of minorities resulted in a higher number of minority students and led to the formation of the Association of Black Social Work Students and of the Hispanic student organization, Trabajadores de la Raza. Due to an increase in financial aid opportunities through grants and scholarships, the school experienced a subsequent increase in enrollment. By 1968, the school ranked first among the seventy-five accredited schools of social work in the United States in enrollment, number of full-time students, and the number of M.S.W. degrees granted each year.</p>
      <p>In July 1971, Dean Fauri was appointed Vice President for State Relations and Planning at the university, and Associate Dean Vinter served as acting dean. In September 1971, the Regents appointed Phillip Fellin as dean and Richard English and Shiela Feld as assistant deans. The school's governing faculty continued to provide for a Faculty Council, which served in an advisory capacity to the dean on school affairs.</p>
      <p>In 1973, the school's ten year re-accreditation review prompted a renewed emphasis on minority recruitment and an assessment of the minority-relevant content of course offerings at the school. The School of Social Work led the university in minority enrollment, as it had done for some time, and reached 21 percent minority enrollment in 1976. Over 68 percent of the student body was comprised of women. In 1976 it was one of only seven schools to receive over 1,000 applications for its master's program, ranking second only to Columbia University. Another outcome of the re-accreditation review was the development of closer ties to other university departments, and to state and local social agencies.</p>
      <p>On July 1, 1981, Harold R. Johnson was appointed dean following the retirement of Phillip Fellin. Prior to becoming dean, Johnson had served as director of the Institute of Gerontology from 1974 to 1981. Johnson's appointment marked a change in leadership and direction of the school. Greater prominence and support were given to teaching and research, and service activities were de-emphasized. At a time when schools of social work around the country faced diminishing resources and were being pressed to provide professional social workers with greater skills, the school embarked on a curriculum overhaul. The curriculum was completely revised to provide students with multiple practice skills, expertise in a field of service, and the capacity to assess and evaluate professional practice. The extent of the curriculum revision was expressed in the words of the Council of Social Work Education in its 1983 re-accreditation report. The report called the reforms a "courageous major revision of a well-established curriculum to conform to the reality of social practice knowledge and skills which graduates will be called upon to possess if they are to meet the needs of the profession in the changing world around us."</p>
      <p>During Johnson's tenure as dean, from 1981 to 1993, the school continued to promote cultural and ethnic diversity. Those goals continued under Johnson's successor, Paula Allen-Meares who became dean in 1993. Major fundraising initiatives helped to focus research on poverty, racial inequalities, children and families, and also allowed the school to move forward on plans for a new building. In 1995 ground was broken for the new School of Social Work Building, designed by Sims-Varner Associates of Detroit. It was intended to foster a sense of community, with pods of faculty offices arranged around open stairways and the glass walls of its state-of-the-art library open to the lobby, lounge and corridors above. The building was officially dedicated on September 25, 1998.</p>

          <p>The Committee Files and Minutes, 1935-1994, are arranged alphabetically by committee name. Administrative/Executive Committee minutes are extant for the years 1957-1968. They address issues of student performance and evaluation, and as such are restricted for a period of 75 years from the date of creation. Continuing Education and Extension Committee was one of several small committees established in the mid-1970s to revise and restructure the social work curriculum. Coordinating Committee minutes, 1953-1960, deal with the funding, budget approval, and coordination of an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in social work and social sciences. Curriculum Committee, 1951-1957 and 1970-1980, address personnel decisions, structural reorganization, and program revision. Executive Committee minutes and supporting material from the years 1945-1987 document major administrative and policy issues facing the school including the proposed merger/reorganization talks between Wayne State University and the University of Michigan social work programs. Faculty Advisory Committee minutes are available for the years 1968-1969, and document efforts to incorporate student involvement in departmental decisions and facilitate better student and faculty relations.</p>
          <p>Faculty Committee minutes are the most abundant in the series and cover the years 1935-1974. They are indexed, although indexes for the later years are somewhat less thorough than those of the earlier years. Topics such as enrollment, admissions, curriculum, and budgets are discussed. Faculty Council minutes, 1969-1983, primarily focus on grading practices and faculty awards and promotions. Faculty Search Committee minutes, 1971-1981, concern efforts to fill various faculty positions within the School. They are restricted for 30 years from the date of creation. Governance Review Committee minutes, 1969-1973, and Governing Faculty Committee minutes, 1974-1991, document efforts to adopt departmental regulations and establish admission criteria and course descriptions. The Governance Review Committee served in an advisory capacity to the dean, whereas the Governing Faculty Committee served the broader faculty.</p>

          <p>The series Correspondence, 1958-1986 (1 linear foot) is primarily comprised of files containing incoming and outgoing letters and memos from the dean's office. The correspondence was filed by name of organization or individual, and that order has been retained in the collection. It consists mainly of university correspondence; there are only five folders of correspondence to non-university individuals and organizations. University correspondence includes materials from Presidents Hatcher, Fleming and Shapiro, and from various administrators in the Vice-President for Academic Affairs office. The correspondence from the Academic Affairs office is arranged by name of each administrator.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files, 1939-1992, subseries (1.5 linear feet) is arranged alphabetically by subject and contains records of various activities within the School of Social Work. The material in these files ranges from reports and proposals to correspondence.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest are the Council for Social Work Education (CSWE) files. These include annual reports submitted by the University of Michigan to CSWE from 1939 to 1983. They include a great deal of statistical information concerning the School of Social Work. Information ranges from faculty and student statistics to grant support and graduation data. Also included in this subseries is a folder of materials for the Annual Meeting in Detroit in 1984 for which Harold Johnson served as chairman of the Plenary Session Subcommittee. Reports prepared for the school's reaccreditation review in 1963 are also included.</p>
            <p>The reaccreditation folders contain memos, correspondence and supporting documentation for the school's 1973 and 1983 reaccreditation reviews. The work of university-wide committees is evidenced in the Intercollegiate Athletics Committee, an ad hoc committee appointed by President Harold Shapiro, and Martin Luther King Symposium folders. Johnson served as the chair for both of these committees.</p>

          <p>The Group Work Program series (2.0 linear feet) dates from 1946 to 1970. Group Work is based on social science and social psychology. During Group Work the social worker acts as an outside force to affect the actions and thinking of the group instead of becoming a part of the group. This series includes three subseries: Administration, Faculty Papers, and Case Studies. Each of these subseries are arranged alphabetically. The Administration subseries contains records of the course work, curriculum, and lists of faculty papers. The Faculty Papers subseries is arranged alphabetically by faculty names. Some of the papers have been published. The Case Study subseries contains case studies done on group work during this time at the university and is arranged alphabetically by topic. There are also three reel-to-reel audio tapes which are included in the records.</p>

          <p>Graduate and Doctoral Program, 1948-1989, is composed of minutes, memoranda and supporting materials of the supervising committee, doctoral committee, and admissions, financial aid, and student services committee. These committees worked closely with the process of selecting students into the graduate programs. Some of the material has been classified as restricted and will be closed for seventy-five years from the date of creation due to sensitive material about students.</p>

          <p>The Winkelman and Fauri Lectures Series, 1951-1958, 1965-1966, is composed of the correspondence surrounding the planning of these two annual lectures. Many of the lectures were published and can be found in the publications finding aid which immediately follows this finding aid. Some of the transcripts are also available online (http://www.ssw.umich.edu/outreach.html). The Leon and Josephine Winkelman Memorial Lecture Series focuses on issues of aging and gerontology. The Fedele F. and Iris M. Fauri Memorial Lecture in Child Welfare is presented annually in recognition of former Dean Fedele F. Fauri and his wife.

          <p>The series Personnel, 1954-1968, contains information on faculty members, the majority of which are deceased. Most folders include some type of obituary in addition to information about their time as a faculty member. The most interesting is the file of Wilbur J. Cohen, who was appointed as Assistant Secretary for Legislation in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare by President Kennedy in 1961, and who later became Secretary of HEW. In addition, Cohen served as dean for the School of Education from 1969 to 1978.</p>

          <p>The Dean's Files (1 linear foot, 1947-1987) series is comprised solely of materials from the office of Dean Fedele Fauri. Materials in this series include a small amount of biographical materials, correspondence (incoming and outgoing), and photographs. The series does contain one document, Lifetime Achievement Award Certificate, presented posthumously in November 1987 by the Michigan League for Human Services. The most extensive materials in the series are speeches presented by Fauri in the various positions he held, including Dean, Director of the Michigan Department of Social Welfare, and Senior Specialist in Social Welfare and Social Security of the Legislative Reference Service in Washington D.C. The majority of the speeches are based on social welfare themes including social security, old-age and survivors insurance coverage and dependent children. The speeches were given to a wide variety of audiences and at a number of locations across the country as well as cities throughout Michigan. The series also includes Fauri's report <title render="italic">The Tax Freeze of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Program Since 1939</title>, prepared for the Senate Finance Committee in 1947, and a report prepared for the Council on Social Work Education dated March 1963.</p>

          <p>Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations (ILIR) (.50 linear feet, 1980-1994), consists of a limited number of records relating to the ILIR. This particular period reflects a transition period for the ILIR as it separated from its original joint partnership with Wayne State University to governance held jointly by the deans of the School of Social Work and School of Business Administration. The official change in governance occurred in 1993. Significant documentation in the series includes a selection of Executive Board minutes (1985-1990) and Internal Review Board minutes (1980-1981). Lastly, the reports <title render="italic">Review of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations</title> (1981) and the <title render="italic">Report on the Future of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations</title> (1993) provide an excellent snapshot of the Institute's mission and goals for this time period. Note that earlier material created by the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations is available at the Bentley Historical Library. See Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations (University of Michigan -- Wayne State University) records, 1949-1975.</p>
