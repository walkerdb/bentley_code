      <p>Founded in 1968 as a non-profit organization by Mrs. Joan Wolfe and other concerned citizens, the West Michigan Environmental Action Council (WMEAC) was established to protect and restore the quality of Michigan's environment. By means of programs of education, legislation, and litigation, WMEAC worked toward the goal of "translating concern into action."</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1970s, as the membership of the organization grew, so too did the number of legislative initiatives and court cases in which WMEAC was involved. During the tenure of Mrs. Joan Wolfe, executive director from 1968 to 1973, the membership grew to seven hundred individuals and sixty Grand Rapids civic and professional organizations. The budget of the organization in this period was $60,000. By 1978-1979 the budget had expanded to $100,000 and membership numbered eight hundred and fifty individuals and seventy civic and professional organizations.</p>
      <p>Originally WMEAC focused its attention on the Grand Rapids and Kent County area. However, the leaders of WMEAC realized that the environmental issues of concern to the Grand Rapids area were identical to problems being faced in other parts of the state. As a result, the leadership decided to establish a series of statewide coalitions and committees of organizations and individuals sharing similar environmental goals. The resulting coordinated effort of similar-minded organizations and individuals was able to produce more effective legislative and legal action in environmental problem areas.</p>
      <p>The rapid expansion and growing diversity of the scope of WMEAC's activities produced a need for more organizational flexibility. Thus, in 1971, WMEAC established two separate tax deductible foundations to aid them in their work. The Michigan Environmental Protection Foundation (MEPF) was organized for the purpose of engaging in environmental litigation; and the WMEAC Education Foundation was created for the purpose of educating the public to environmental issues and problem areas. The budget for the Michigan Environmental Protection Foundation was drawn from donations specifically solicited to carry forward certain legal suits. The MEPF was commissioned to choose its lawsuits carefully in order to establish precedents and lay important groundwork in the field of environmental law.</p>
      <p>In 1973, Mrs. Joan Wolfe was appointed to the Department of Natural Resources' Natural Resource Commission by Governor William Milliken. Succeeding Mrs. Wolfe as the executive director was Roger Conner, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School. While in school Conner and some of his fellow law students had organized the Environmental Law Society. He also served as a research assistant to Professor Joseph L. Sax, the author of Michigan's Environmental Protection Act of 1970. Conner became the first full-time executive director of WMEAC. During his tenure, WMEAC involved itself more in court actions and sought in this fashion to support the progress made through legislation.</p>
      <p>Conner left WMEAC in 1978 and Kenneth Sikkema, a native of Cadillac, Michigan, replaced him. Sikkema had been a legislative assistant and this experience had given him a knowledge of legislative personnel and procedures helpful to WMEAC in maintaining effective channels of communication with the state legislature. During Sikkema's tenure, several important pieces of environmental legislation supported and sponsored by WMEAC were passed by the state legislature. Among these were the Solid Waste and Hazardous Waste Act (1979) and the Wetlands Protection Act (1979). Significant new programs were also created by WMEAC during this period such as the Michigan Used Oil Recycling Program (MUORP) in 1979, and the establishment of a coalition of Michigan environmental groups called the Michigan Environmental Council (MEC) in 1980.</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s WMEAC continued to play a vital role in both local and statewide environmental education, litigation and legislation. During this period, however, the group's emphasis shifted away from direct involvement in environmental lawsuits and towards more of a public "watchdog" to monitor actions and decisions in private and public sectors that could have an impact on West Michigan's environment, and to alert the community to potential environmental harm. WMEAC fulfilled this role through representing environmental concerns behind the scenes in local, state, and federal governmental offices; providing informed testimony at public hearings, commission meetings, in the legislature and before judicial bodies; and intervening directly to protect the environment through litigation and legislation when necessary.</p>
      <p>As public environmental awareness continued to grow throughout this period and environmental battles became more intensified and polarized, WMEAC continued to promote itself as a moderate organization which provided a "grass-roots" reflection of the West Michigan community itself. WMEAC thus endeavored to build coalitions with diverse interests in order to find "common ground" solutions to environmental problems rather than pursue radical activism. This approach proved highly successful as WMEAC achieved numerous significant accomplishments and launched several important new programs under the leadership of executive directors Frank Ruswick, Jr. (1982-1987) and Robert Newberry (1988-1992).</p>
      <p>With the departure of Ken Sikkema in September 1982, Frank Ruswick, Jr. was chosen by the Board of Directors to become WMEAC's new executive director. Ruswick, a University of Michigan Law School graduate, left his post as Attorney Advisor in the U.S. Department of the Interior's Division of Conservation and Wildlife, and accepted the position. Under his tenure, WMEAC expanded its sponsorship of Michigan's first used motor oil recycling program (MUORP), extending its scope from its West Michigan headquarters to cover virtually the entire state. As the Michigan legislature continued to balk at constructing a state-funded program, WMEAC by default became the organizer of this ambitious privately-run program, which provided the only recycling sources for "do-it-yourself" oil disposal in the state. Due to constraints upon WMEAC's financial and other resources this program was able to recover only a small portion of the used motor oil dumped by "do-it-yourself" oil changers. The program, however, raised awareness statewide of the need for a government-funded recycling effort to address this problem. Other major programs developed by WMEAC during this era included a two-year project to work cooperatively with the West Michigan industrial and agricultural communities to reduce "nonpoint source" pollution of lakes and streams, development of an annual "Youth Conference on the Environment," and creation of a "Speaker's Bureau," a committee of volunteers and staff available to speak on environmental issues for area schools, organizations and groups.</p>
      <p>Several important pieces of environmental legislation were also enacted as a result of WMEAC's activities during the directorship of Ruswick. The most significant of these legislative victories included passage of the Surface and Underground Mine Reclamation Act (1982), the Great Lakes Oil Drilling Ban (1982), the Peat Mining Act (1984), and the statewide ban on the use of the pesticide Chlordane (1987).</p>
      <p>Ruswick resigned in October 1987 to accept a position as chief of Michigan's Civilian Conservation Corps, and Robert Newberry, then a WMEAC program specialist and pesticides expert, was named acting executive director. Newberry, a longtime Grand Rapids resident and graduate of Grand Valley State College with a degree in environmental science, was officially appointed executive director in January 1988, and under his leadership WMEAC continued its legislative success and developed several new programs which further expanded the scope of the group's influence both locally and statewide.</p>
      <p>Most notable among the new programs established by WMEAC during Newberry's tenure were "YIKES!" (Young Idealistic Kids with Environmental Sensitivity - 1989), Designs for Environmental Awareness (1989), the Adopt-A-Stream Program (1991) and Project Greenspace (1992). YIKES! was established as a WMEAC-sponsored high school group and has engaged in such activities as Christmas tree recycling, letter-writing campaigns and making recycled paper. Designs for Environmental Awareness was a grant-funded program created to extend community awareness of local environmental concerns and efforts through consultations and workshop applications. The Adopt-A-Stream Program is an ongoing project which enables school, service, church and community organizations to "adopt" West Michigan streams in order to protect water quality and wildlife habitats. Project Greenspace was created to identify, protect and connect parks, fields, gardens and wooded areas which exist within West Michigan urban landscapes.</p>
      <p>As always, WMEAC was very politically active during this era and its success in helping to enact environmental legislation continued unabated. Notable accomplishments included the Statewide Sewer Overflow Policy (1988), the Used Oil Dumping Ban (1990), Polluters Pay (1990), and the successful campaign of environmental groups led by WMEAC to block Governor Engler's proposed shakeup of the Department of Natural Resources, which would have eliminated many of the DNR's boards (1992).</p>
      <p>With the resignation of Newberry in September 1992, the Board of Directors culminated a five-month, nationwide search with the selection of Dr. Sandra Marlatt as its new executive director. Marlatt, a Grand Rapids native whose diverse background includes teaching at Michigan State University, marketing county parks for the Kalamazoo County Visitors and Convention Bureau and running a 1,600-acre nature center in Nebraska, was commissioned to engineer the fulfillment of the goals of a five-year strategic plan enacted by the WMEAC Board of Directors in 1991. This plan calls for the establishment of ecosystems land use planning, the creation of strategies/programs to control non-point source water pollution and reduce toxic air emissions in West Michigan, and efforts to increase WMEAC's endowment fund by $500,000 and membership to 5000 by 1996.</p>
      <p>Martlatt's tenure was short, and WMEAC went through several leaders over the next few years. Thomas Leonard, who considers himself more of an administrator than an environmentalist, took over the leadership role in 1995.</p>
      <p>The projects Leonard has been involved with include the US-31 Bypass, Kent County International Airport, and the Nordhouse Dunes litigation. He has also been a member of several committees with work related to WMEAC's mission. One such group is the West Michigan Sustainable Business Forum.</p>
      <p>New Working Groups have continued to be formed. The Religion, Ecology, and Spirituality group has been active planning Earth Day celebrations, and other such activities.</p>
      <p>WMEAC has applied for grants to fund a number of initiatives, and both the Board of Directors and Leonard have taken an active interest in the retention and recruitment of members, as well as insuring the continued financial solvency of the organization.</p>

            <p>The Board of Directors files contain records produced out of the operations and regular meetings conducted by the WMEAC Board of Directors. The "Board Decisions" files contain annual summaries of the policies and strategic positions adopted by the board from 1975 to 1994 on issues such as new programs to be launched, educational efforts, and support of various pieces of environmental legislation and litigation. As such, the board decisions provide a valuable resource for tracking the evolution of WMEAC's stances on the environmental problems of the era which, unlike the meeting minutes, are not encumbered by routine administrative decisions and other procedural matters. The board's "Minutes," 1968-1992, provide insight into the reasons behind major policy decisions and the dynamics of the operation of the Board of Directors. Also included, interspersed within the official minutes, are committee and financial reports and budget summaries.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Executive Director files, as well as the files of the Assistant Director, Administrative Director, Administrative Staff, Engineering/Planning Coordinator, and Program Staff primarily comprise correspondence, arranged chronologically, and produced through the various operations and responsibilities of the different positions of the WMEAC administrative staff. Only a sampling of routine membership correspondence is included in the record group. The great majority of the materials included are substantive and provide a view of the overall scope and depth of WMEAC staff activities. Most notable are the plethora of letters written by WMEAC staff to various members of local and state legislatures, government agencies and the governor's office in support or criticism of various governmental actions with environmental implications. The interplay between WMEAC staff and local communities, business interests, and civic groups is documented here, and WMEAC's coalition and consensus-building efforts and moderate tactics are also clearly displayed.</p>

          <p>The Legislative Files reveal WMEAC's interaction with the Michigan legislature and the Governor's office. These files begin with the 75th Legislative session (1969-1970) and continue through the 80th Legislative session (1979-1980). Of interest are materials concerning the legislative histories of bills relating to returnable bottles and cans, off-road vehicles, sand dunes and mineral mining, and the management of solid wastes.</p>

          <p>The Litigation Files consist of materials concerning legal cases which either involved WMEAC directly or indirectly through the Michigan Environmental Protection Foundation. Court papers documenting the development of several lawsuits involving the WMEAC are complete, and reveal how the WMEAC either defended established statutes against industry and/or government's attempts to interpret these statutes in a manner which could result in potential damage to the environment; or how the WMEAC sued individuals, industry, and government when specific environmental statutes were being ignored or disobeyed. Important lawsuits here involve the Consumers Power Company (Big Rock Nuclear Plant in Charlevoix, Michigan); attempts by various oil companies and the state of Michigan to allow drilling within the Pigeon River State Forest; and the banning of the pesticide DDT.</p>
          <p>The Michigan Environmental Protection Foundation's legal actions are concerned with specific lawsuits where it hoped to establish legal precedents on issues of environmental quality and protection. The records concern in part the development of property on Little Traverse Bay and Torch Lake; advertising on Grand Rapids city benches; the proper uses of nuclear power; and highway construction.</p>

          <p>The Chlordane Ban Efforts, 1981-1988 series documents the long struggle of WMEAC and individuals from the local community to support the enactment of a statewide ban on the use of the pesticide Chlordane (a termiticide used extensively by Michigan pest control companies). The series is composed of three parts: Chlordane Investigation (Michigan Dept. of Health), 1985-1986; Newberry, Robert E., (WMEAC Program Specialist and Executive Director) and; Tvedten Steve (Stroz, Inc.).</p>
          <p>Taken together these files illustrate how a typical WMEAC environmental campaign was organized and implemented, and elucidate the various dynamics involved in the interaction of the group with private individuals and businesses and local/state government. The correspondence of Steve Tvedten, president of a Grand Rapids pest control company who became concerned with the health effects of the chemical on his workers and homeowners, in conjunction with the correspondence of Robert Newberry of the WMEAC staff, exemplifies how an individual's concerns were translated into effective political action by WMEAC. The materials on the Chlordane Investigation by the Michigan Dept. of Health (1985-1986) document how WMEAC was able to counteract and question the validity of a government-sponsored investigation which claimed that Chlordane was safe to use. The culmination of the efforts documented in these records was the signing of a state law banning the use of this dangerous pesticide by Governor Blanchard in 1988.</p>

          <p>The WMEAC Non-serial Publications series is comprised of some of the printed materials published by WMEAC, along with some related correspondence/records. The series is divided into Educational Materials and <title render="italic">Michigan Environs</title>.</p>
          <p>The Educational Materials contain evidence of the wide-ranging educational efforts undertaken by WMEAC, a topic somewhat under-documented in the rest of the 1994 accession. It is composed primarily of pamphlets, brochures and instructional notebooks produced during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The materials are focused upon four major topical areas: global warming, solid waste disposal, water pollution and youth involvement. Particularly valuable are: the "Global Warming Review," an informative brochure published by WMEAC in 1990 to educate the public on the issues involved; an instructional notebook designed for participants in WMEAC's ambitious "Adopt-A-Stream" program, which outlines the purpose and goals of the program along with information on water pollution reversal tactics and methods; and brochures and pamphlets produced by "YIKES" (Young Idealistic Kids with Environmental Sensitivity), which provide details on the program's goals, activities and accomplishments from 1989 to 1994.</p>
          <p><title render="italic">Michigan Environs</title> is composed of materials relating to WMEAC's attempt during the early 1980s to publish an environmental magazine which was intended to be distributed through individual subscriptions and sales to state public and school libraries. This project was originally grant-funded and expected to become self-sustaining, however, financial and staff limitations led to its demise in 1982.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The WMEAC Publicity and Media Coverage series documents both internal and external efforts to publicize and analyze programs, campaigns and accomplishments of WMEAC. The materials span virtually the entire history of the group (1968-2005), and are divided into Clippings, Hearing Statements, Photographs, and Press Releases.</p>
          <p>The Clippings consist of primarily newspaper or magazine articles, accumulated by WMEAC staff, that document the programs, activities, and accomplishments of the group over the years. The overwhelming majority of the clippings originate from the <title render="italic">Grand Rapids Press</title> and other local West Michigan newspapers and include, along with normal news coverage, various editorials both favorable and unfavorable of WMEAC policies. As such, these chronologically arranged articles present a fascinating account of the interaction between WMEAC and the local community and document the impact of WMEAC on both state and national environmental debates. Also included are several feature-length articles describing the nature and scope of the organization and the motivations and personalities of WMEAC leaders.</p>
          <p>The Hearing Statements are transcripts of testimony delivered by WMEAC members at various legislative and other hearings from 1968 to 1990. These materials are contained within the Publicity and Media Coverage series because they were utilized by WMEAC in a manner similar to press releases, i.e. they were intended mainly to elucidate and publicize WMEAC positions on various legislative and litigious issues.</p>
          <p>The Press Releases is a fairly complete collection of press releases issued by WMEAC. WMEAC employed their press releases as a means of publicizing organizational activities, announcing new programs or staff appointments, and stating official positions on various legislative and other governmental actions, and legal suits in which WMEAC was directly or indirectly involved. Some of the topics covered in this files are: nuclear power, air pollution/Clean Air Act, the banning of the pesticides DDT and Chlordane, the Michigan Bottle Bill, the Michigan Used Motor Oil Recycling Program, the Great Lakes Oil Drilling Ban, the formation of the Michigan Environmental Council and sand dune protection efforts.</p>

          <p>The WMEAC Serial Publications series includes all publications that have been published with some sort of regularity throughout the organization's existence. The main publication, currently titled <title render="italic">Action Issue</title>, has been in continuous publication since April 1970. The name, though, has changed over the years. The "Action Alerts" are a series of informational flyers produced by WMEAC between 1977-1984, which were designed to call the membership's attention to various environmental issues and to promote direct and immediate action through letter-writing campaigns or other lobbying efforts. Published with less regularity are the MCBWM Newsletters, the Michigan Environs Update, and the Sand Dune Bulletin.</p>
