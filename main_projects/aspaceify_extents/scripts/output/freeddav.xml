      <p>David Noel Freedman is a member of the generation of Biblical scholars influenced by the teachings of William F. Albright, professor of Semitic languages at Johns Hopkins University. Their work has been characterized by the application of linguistic and archeological evidence to Biblical texts.</p>
      <p>Freedman was born in 1922 in New York City to Jewish parents, David and Beatrice Freedman. After attending classes at City College of New York from 1935-1938, Freedman continued his studies and received his B.A. from U.C.L.A. in 1939. He then entered the Princeton Theological Seminary and was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1944. For one year, between 1944-1945, he served as pastor at Acme and Deming in Washington. In 1945, he returned to school, earning his PhD from Johns Hopkins University in 1948. It was while a student at Johns Hopkins that Freedman met F.W. Albright. This marked the start of a friendship and a professional relationship which would continue until Albright's death in 1971, and which would have an important influence on Freedman's development as a scholar.</p>
      <p>Upon receiving his doctorate in 1948, Freedman was appointed professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Literature at Western Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh. In 1960, he joined the faculty of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, where he taught until 1964. In that year, he moved to the San Francisco Bay area, where he served on the faculty of two institutions. He was professor of the Old Testament at the Graduate Theological Union at Berkeley from 1964-1971. During the same period, he taught courses in the Old Testament and Hebrew exegesis at the San Francisco Theological Seminary, where he also served as Dean of the Faculty from 1966 to 1970, and as Acting Dean of the Seminary in 1970-1971. In 1971, the University of Michigan secured his services as professor of Near Eastern Studies, and as director of the Program on Studies in Religion.</p>
      <p>Freedman has been active in a number of organizations. He is a member of the Society of Biblical Literature, a past president of that body (1975-1976) and editor of their Journal of Biblical Literature from 1952 to 1959. He served as director of the Albright Institute for Archaeological Research in Jerusalem in 1969-1970 and 1976-1978. His role in the American Schools of Oriental Research has been especially active. He served as vice-president from 1970-1982, and as director of publications from 1974-1982. This organization sponsors a number of publications, including the <title render="italic">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research</title>, of which Freedman was editor from 1974-1978 and the <title render="italic">Biblical Archeologist</title> of which he was editor from 1976-1982.</p>
      <p>Perhaps his most ambitious project has been the ongoing editorship of the <title render="italic">Anchor Bible</title>, which he assumed in 1956. This publication is made up of translations, with extensive commentary, of various books of the Bible. It represents a collaboration of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish scholars and is unique for its nonsectarian and scholarly analysis of Biblical texts.</p>
      <p>David Noel Freedman died April 8, 2008.</p>

          <p>The Subject Files, which are in alphabetical order and cover the period 1977-1982, chiefly reflect Freedman's involvement with the American Schools of Oriental Research. The files include incoming and outgoing correspondence, as well as memoranda and minutes. Centered around the time period when Freedman was editor of the Biblical Archeologist, the files contain a great deal of material documenting his involvement with the journal and the activities of his editorial staff. During this same time period, A.S.O.R.'s Committee on Publications, of which Freedman was chairman, decided to withdraw from a publishing consortium called Scholars Press and to produce its publications locally. There is interesting material documenting financial and editorial pressures leading to this decision. other files contain correspondence on controversial topics, such as the archeological discoveries at Ebla or the debate surrounding the Shroud of Turin.</p>

          <p>The Anchor Bible series contains Freedman's correspondence between 1955 and 1983 with three of his editors: Joseph A. Fitzmeyer, editor of the Gospel of Luke, Jonathan Goldstein, editor of Maccabees, and P. Kyle McCarter, editor of Samuel. Freedman's detailed notes and suggestions on translation, and his editorial commentaries on the analysis of difficult passages are extremely interesting.</p>
          <p>The files grouped under the 1965-1977 heading, part of the 2006 accession, contain correspondence between Freedman and the various contributors for the Anchor Bible Series. Some material is not dated and may fall outside the specified date range. The Anchor Bible Series is a series of retranslations of Old Testament biblical texts with notes and commentaries on the translation. The bulk of the material consists of comments, notes, and corrections by Freedman of the manuscripts submitted for publication. While many of the corrections are trivial, Freedman also gives a large amount of commentary expressing his opinions and thoughts about the ancient texts and appropriate translations. The folders are organized alphabetically by the manuscript author's last name.</p>

          <p>The Genesis Project is a commercial, educational firm for which the Program on Studies in Religion served in an advisory capacity. The project documented here is the transcription of four seminars which occurred between December 1974 and March 1975 and involved Freedman and other religious scholars. Two of the seminars dealt with the story of Abraham, one with the New Testament, and one with the stories of John the Baptist and the Nativity. It is the transcriptions, with penciled-in corrections, which make up this series.</p>

          <p>The series on the Religious Films Development Project contains correspondence with officers of the Lilly Endowment, which funded the project from June 1976 through June 1977. At least two television films were produced under the auspices of the Project: Jacob and Joseph and The Story of David. Freedman acted in an advisory capacity for both films, to ensure historical accuracy in such details as costume and language. The series contains a partial script of Jacob and Joseph and the full script of The Story of David as well as publicity materials.</p>

          <p>The William F. Albright Series, 1945-1975 consists mostly of material (typically correspondence) relating to Albright posthumously and a large amount consists of correspondence between Freedman and Albright. Freedman assisted in executing Albright's literary estate, the compiling and editing of a comprehensive Albright Bibliography and a Biography of Albright. The materials are organized into three sub series: Background, Bibliography, and Correspondence. The Background subseries consists of obituary material written by Freedman about Albright and related material written by multiple authors giving biographical information about Albright. The sub series also includes material documenting the executing of Albright's literary estate. The Bibliography subseries consists of correspondence relating to the compiling and publishing of a comprehensive Albright Bibliography. The majority of the Correspondence subseries is made up of correspondence between Freedman and Albright for the majority of their acquaintance. It begins with a response from Albright to a letter of introduction written by Freedman in 1945, and continues as the two men develop relationships as mentor/mentee, colleagues, co-workers, and friends. There is a small amount of correspondence between 1945 and 1949, after which time the correspondence begins to increase in frequency and length. While there is evidence of a close relationship between the two men's families, the correspondence maintains a very professional tone and subject matter. The remainder of the sub series contains correspondence between Freedman and various individuals about Albright, Albright projects, and reminiscence about Albright. Some of the folders contain copies of correspondence between the various individuals and Albright, which were sent to Freedman after Albright's death. The latter correspondence relates mostly to the executing of Albright's estate, and contain a signed copy of the legal agreement between the Albright heirs and the Albright Institute which established the group responsible for executing Albright's literary estate.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files Series, 1955-1978 contains material concerning several projects and organizations in which Freedman participated. It includes research projects, periodicals, publications, the Michigan University Press, the Michigan State Board of Education and the Council on the Study of Religion. The Council on the Study of Religion (CSR) is comprised of several smaller organizations and Freedman was very active in a few of them. The Council on the Study of Religion subseries contains material relating to his activities in the larger organization and in these sub organizations: the Council on the Study of Religion in Michigan Public Schools and the American Academy of Religion. A few folders in the CSR subseries pertain to the publishing of a book for the American Academy of Religion based on a set of lectures given at a weekend conference organized by Freedman for the Program in Studies on Religion at the University of Michigan.</p>
