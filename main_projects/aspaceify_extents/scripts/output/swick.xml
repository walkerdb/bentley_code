      <p>Arthur Southwick received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wooster College in 1947. His graduate studies led him to the University of Michigan where he received a Masters in Business Administration in 1950 and a Juris Doctor degree in 1951. Southwick became a University of Michigan faculty member in 1956 as an assistant professor of Business Law in the School of Business Administration. He advanced to associate professor in 1961 and to full professor in 1966. In 1975, he also became a professor of Hospital Administration, now known as Health Services Management and Policy within the School of Public Health.</p>
      <p>Throughout his career, Southwick was known for his outstanding service to his students and his field of research. At his retirement, the Board of Regents reflected on his years of devotion to his students. They noted how Professor Southwick's courses contained "lively classroom coverage of complex legal issues" and that he often devoted much of his time to students' issues and research ideas. Professor Southwick's love for teaching is shown through his ample files of teaching notes within these papers. Letters of appreciation from former students fill his correspondence file.</p>
      <p>Southwick believed that current research was necessary to provide the best possible classroom leadership. His files reveal active interests within many areas of health administration and business law. The papers contain only a few of his many publications, including the widely used and cited <title render="italic">The Law of Hospital and Health Care Administration</title>. He also published many book chapters and articles, influencing health care practices, ethics, regulations, and law. Professor Southwick was also on the editorial board of the <title render="italic">American Journal of Law and Medicine</title> and served on the editorial advisory board for <title render="italic">Issues in Health Care Technology</title> and <title render="italic">Hospital Risk Control</title>. He was a member of the American Academy of Health Care Attorneys, the Academy of Legal Studies in Business, the National Health Lawyers Association, and the American Society of Law, Medicine, and Ethics.</p>
      <p>Arthur Southwick's achievements have been honored in many ways. The University of Michigan School of Business Administration offers an award in his name. The Southwick Award is annually given to the undergraduate student that submits the best paper in Business Administration course 380: Business Law Senior Seminar, an honors-type class culminating in a major research paper. The award recognizes Arthur Southwick as an outstanding teacher and researcher.</p>
      <p>Arthur Southwick retired from the University of Michigan in 1990. He was granted professor emeritus status in health services management and policy from the School of Public Health and in business law from the School of Business Administration upon retirement.</p>
      <p>He passed away March 3, 1997 at the age of 73.</p>

      <p>The Arthur F. Southwick Papers are divided into four series: Biographical Materials, Publications, Subject Files, and Teaching Notes. The papers retain their original series groupings. Folders are arranged in alphabetical order within each series according to their original folder labels. Full text legal cases were removed from the folders as well as articles from widely available sources such as <title render="italic">The New York Times</title> and <title render="italic">The Washington Post</title>.</p>

          <p>The Biographical Materials series (1959-1987, 0.2 linear feet) contains professional correspondence and photographs of Arthur Southwick. Many of the letters express gratitude toward Southwick for presentations, publications, teaching, and his general professional activities. The correspondence reveals the depth and breadth of his work as well as the positive influence he had on the health care administration and legal issues fields throughout his career. The photographs folder contains images of Southwick speaking at a presentation in 1971.</p>

          <p>The Manuscripts and Publication Records series (1967-1994, 0.3 linear feet) contains a sample of Arthur Southwick's writings and accompanying documentation. The majority of the Publications Series documents the creation and revisions of Southwick's notable book <title render="italic">Law of Hospital and Health Care Administration</title>. It includes drafts, notes, correspondence, reviews, and publicity. About half of the material describes Southwick's original book and additional editions. However, additional folders describe an accompanying manual, <title render="italic">Law of Hospital and Health Care Administration: Cases and Materials</title>, compiled by J. Stuart Showalter and Bernard D. Reams, Jr., based on Southwick's original text. These folders contain correspondence between the editors and Southwick as well as Southwick's notes and responses to the manual. The Medical Staff Privileges folder holds many articles, both published and manuscript copies, regarding the rights and responsibilities of physicians and hospitals.</p>

          <p>Teaching Notes (1958-1995, 1.2 linear feet) comprise the remainder of the papers. Most of the folders are labeled for specific classes taught by Southwick. Topics within the General Subjects subseries were not designated for a particular class. These folders contain handwritten outlines and notes about each subject. They also occasionally hold newspaper clippings, references to legal proceedings, and articles relevant to the subject. Notes for specific courses are organized by department and number under the Classes subseries heading. Course titles changed often within Southwick's teaching career and every attempt has been made to include the most relevant variations. Regardless of school or department, Southwick's notes all hold similar contents including lecture outlines and notes, relevant articles and newsclippings, listings of bibliographical sources, and occasional syllabi, course descriptions, assignments, and reading lists. Most of the notes are not dated. Southwick also collected other course materials for some classes that he previously taught, mainly in the Health Management and Policy Department within the School of Public Health.</p>
