    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Henry Hitt Crane was born in Danville, Illinois on February 2, 1890, the son of Charles A. Crane and Sallie Hitt Crane. In his boyhood he traveled as his father, a Methodist minister, was transferred about to different pastorates in Danville, Colorado Springs, and then Boston, where Charles Crane accepted appointment as pastor of the People's Temple. Coming from five generations of Methodist ministers, Henry Hitt Crane early on decided to follow in this family tradition. After graduating from Boston Latin School, he graduated from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut in 1913. Next came seminary work at the Boston University School of Theology, during which time in 1915 he married Helen Beck. He graduated from seminary in 1916 then followed this up with post-graduate work at Harvard.</p>
      <p>Crane's first pastorate in Gorham, Maine was interrupted by the First World War. In 1917, he took a leave from his church to serve with the Y.M.C.A. in front line duty. His exposure here to the brutalities of war transformed Crane into a pacifist, a position to which he would adhere for the remainder of his life. Crane returned to Gorham for a brief period of time, then moved on to a Newton, Massachusetts church for two years from 1918 to 1920. For nine years (1920-1928), he was pastor of the Centre Methodist Church in Malden, Massachusetts. In 1928, he was appointed pastor of the Elm Park Methodist Church in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Located in the heart of the anthracite coal region, Elm Park was ranked as one of the three greatest Methodist Episcopal churches in the nation. Here Crane bolstered his reputation for controversy, organizing meetings of the American League Against War and Fascism, which the American Legion had labeled as "communistic." While at Elm Park, Crane took a year-long (1936-1937) sabbatical to tour the world to study for himself world conditions and the political tumult then occurring in Europe and the Far East.</p>
      <p>In June 1938, Crane was appointed to the pastorate of the Central Methodist Church of Detroit. Central Methodist, located at the juncture of Woodward and Adams, had been built in 1866, and had a reputation of a "free and liberal pulpit." Crane was to flourish in this setting. He was both a gifted and prolific speaker, a writer of some note, and a champion of liberal causes. In the tradition of many nineteenth-century pastors, Crane used his pulpit to speak out on the issues of the day. Most especially, he espoused the cause of peace, supporting those who would be conscientious objectors during World War II and speaking out against the confrontational policies of the Cold War. He was a committed pacifist whose views during the 1950s and 1960s brought him much public attention and notoriety. Crane never backed down in his beliefs despite being listed as a suspected subversive by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Crane was also involved in other liberal causes. A staunch opponent of bigotry, Crane often spoke out against anti-Semitism and race discrimination. Through his efforts the Detroit Round Table of Catholics, Jews and Protestants was formed, a group that was influential in Detroit religious affairs.</p>
      <p>Crane served at Central Methodist for twenty years before retiring in 1958. For the next nearly twenty years, Crane continued traveling and speaking throughout the country. He died May 19, 1977 at age 87.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The files of clergy are often narrow in scope encompassing only the activities of an individual within the setting of his/her own church. Henry Hitt Crane was more than the pastor of Central Methodist Church in Detroit. He was a nationally known speaker, eloquent in his advocacy of pacifism and civil rights. The Crane collection reflects the scope of his activities both within the churches he pastored, within the city of Detroit as an influential church leader, and nationally within larger Methodist circles and among other advocates of liberal causes similar to his own. Through his correspondence, articles, and published messages, we see Crane as representative of that class of nationally known clergymen, respected for their opinions, champion of progressive causes, and willing participants in the often contentious debates that followed World War I on matters of morality, politics, and social justice.</p>
      <p>The Crane papers, with some exceptions, cover the period when Henry Hitt Crane first entered the ministry during the years of World War I and continuing past his retirement, until approximately 1964. There is decidedly less material from the years before his coming to Central Methodist Church in 1938; by far the largest bulk of documents date from 1938 to 1958 when Crane pastored this metropolitan church. The exceptions to the basic span dates of 1917 to 1958 are files collected by Crane of sermons, published pamphlets, and other materials of his father and uncle, also Methodist clergymen. There are also materials that date after 1958, mainly copies of messages received from other clergy with some correspondence.</p>
      <p>The Crane papers have been maintained in the order as created by Crane and his secretarial staff at Central Methodist Church. The series in the collection are Correspondence, Subject Reference Files, Name Files, Sermon Files, Scrapbooks, Church Bulletins and Newsletters, Visual Materials, and Retirement Files.</p>

          <p>The series Correspondence, 1938-1958 (17.5 linear feet) has been arranged alphabetically by name of correspondent. Except for a few individual named files, this series consists of folders with alphabetical letter descriptions only (e.g., Fa-Far or We-Wj). For his twenty-year career at Central Methodist Church, Crane maintained a single alphabet for all of his voluminous correspondence. For the researcher interested in a specific name, this arrangement is ideal; for the researcher interested in a period of time, Crane's arrangement obviously poses difficulties. The series' great value is in showing the great breadth of Crane's correspondents. Part of the files are with members of his congregation, but of more significance perhaps are the letters exchanged with other Methodist clergy throughout the nation. In this latter category, the researcher will find discussions of current events, church politics, and the day-to-day challenges of being a member of the clergy.</p>

          <p>Within the Subject Reference File, ca. 1902-1966 (1.75 linear feet), the researcher will find an assortment of materials mainly pertaining to Crane's interests and activities. Some of the files were probably originally created by Crane's father and uncle. These include, for example, the published essays of his uncle, Frank Crane, on different inspirational topics, and manuscripts of prayers probably authored by his father, Charles A. Crane.</p>
          <p>Crane used the Subject Reference File for his notes from his years of seminary study and for his senior thesis, "Socialism and the Kingdom of God." Here also are files relating to specific Methodist Church activities, notably his work with the Methodist Federation for Social Action, 1945-1952, and his involvement in a crusade against vice when he pastored in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 1934.</p>

          <p>Sermon File, 1925-1958 (7.75 linear feet) consists of three subseries. One is an alphabetical sequence of typescripts and reprints of the sermons preached by Henry Hitt Crane while he was pastor of Central Methodist Church, 1938-1958. The second subseries is a card file with several sections. The most extensive is an alphabetical listing of sermon titles with the date(s) and place(s) where the message was given and followed by the notecards created by Crane in preparing the message. Unlike the subseries of sermon messages, this card file dates back to 1925. Smaller portions of the card file subseries document Crane's salary and speech honorarium payments. There is another card file, arranged alphabetically by city that lists the day, place, and title of message given by Crane. These card files, more than any other source, highlight the scope of Crane's speaking obligations. Crane in some years averaged more than one speech or sermon message per day. The third subseries within the Sermon File consists of reel-to-reel sound tapes of messages given by Crane at Central Methodist Church. There are approximately 150 reels in this series. Some of the tapes consist of messages given by other speakers. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for one, spoke at Central Methodist in 1957.</p>
