      <p>The Department of Internal Medicine of the University of Michigan Medical School had its origins in 1848 when Abram Sager was appointed professor of Theory and Practice of Medicine. The department included, at various stages, divisions and studies of pathology, pediatrics and other medical disciplines in the fledgling field of internal medicine. The department was officially given the name of Department of Internal Medicine in 1908.</p>
      <p>Dr. Cyrus C. Sturgis was named the first chair of the Department of Internal Medicine in 1928; he served at this post until his retirement in 1959. Sturgis divided the department into four general medical services: medical outpatient service, private medical service, tuberculosis service and a diabetic outpatient service. Over time the department grew and changed to parallel the changes in medical research and science. Dr. William D. Robinson succeeded Dr. Sturgis as chair of the department in 1959. He was replaced by Dr. William N. Kelly in 1971. (Dr. Robinson's personal papers are also located at the Bentley Historical Library.)</p>
      <p>Under Dr. Kelly's leadership, the department's budget grew from $2 million to $39 million as he strove to make it one of the leading departments in the country. Divisions were added and restructured as Kelly worked to develop and strengthen clinical research and new multi-disciplinary centers. He also sought to improve interdepartmental cooperation and collaboration. Dr. Kelly left the department in 1990. He was replaced by Dr. Tadataka Yamada, who served until 1996. Yamada was followed by H. David Humes.</p>
      <p>As of 1993, 14 divisions comprise the department: Allergy, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Gastroentology, General Medicine, Geriatric Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Hypertension, Infectious Diseases, Molecular Genetics, Neurology, Nuclear Medicine, Pulmonary, and Rheumatology.</p>
      <p>For more information, see the department's web page at: http://www.med.umich.edu/intmed/.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The records of the department have arrived in three separate accessions in 1986 (box 1), 1992 (boxes 2-21), and 1998 (boxes 22-28).</p>
      <p>The 1992 accession of the records of the Department of Internal Medicine are primarily from the years when William Kelly served as chair (1971-1990). The accession is divided into five series: Division Files, Topical Files, Meeting Minutes, Chairman's Files, and Pollard Medical Research Institute.</p>
      <p>The 1998 accession contains the files of Chris Durovich, the Chief Administrator of the Department of Internal Medicine and covers the period from 1990 to 1996. As one would expect given this origin, these materials are focused more on the administration of the department than on its medical mission. The many topical files relating to managed care and organizational restructuring (such as the Cost Effectiveness Program (CEP), Redesign Coordinating Group, and Structure Work Group) reveal the many pressures on the department during this period. Durovich was also active in many inter and intradepartmental committees and workgroups, including the Clinical Departmental Administrators and the DAAD (Division Administrators and Directors); he also attended the Division Chiefs Meetings. This accession is divided into two series: Topical Files and Financial Files.</p>
      <p>The record group includes a significant amount of closed records, mostly personnel and student records. The closed files are listed in their logical order in the collection, but at the time of processing were physically removed to separate boxes of closed files. Some files now open are still housed in the closed boxes. Consult the reference staff to gain access to these files.</p>

          <p>This linear foot of the Department of Internal Medicine records consists of two series. The first series, Early Administrative Records, contains information dating from 1931 to 1959, including notes from discussion groups regarding intern and residency programs, medical school teaching, and patient and outpatient care, as well as correspondence and lecture notes, copies of major addresses given before Internal Medicine staff and students, personal notes and lecture outlines by Dr. Cyrus C. Sturgis, Chief of Medical Service. This series also contains the <title render="italic">Precedent Book for Instructors in Charge of Interns</title>, developed by Dr. Sturgis in 1931, which contains information regarding the specific duties of interns and the manner in which their work was to be supervised.</p>

          <p>Topical Files (6.1 linear feet) are arranged alphabetically and document the department's relationship with the Medical School administration, other departments and university hospitals. Research projects and department administrative activities are also documented through correspondence, memos and planning papers. The researcher should note that the Division Files series sometimes contains topical files and the Topical Files series sometimes contains division files. The files have been kept in the order in which they were received from the department. When looking for materials related to a particular topic or division, the researcher should search both series.</p>

          <p>The Pollard Medical Research Institute (.5 linear feet) series documents the development of the Institute within the Department of Internal Medicine. It is a primary example of the development of study and treatment centers developed during Kelly's tenure. The Pollard Medical Research Institute is a multi-disciplinary center investigating cancer, strokes, heart attacks and arthritis.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files (6.0 linear feet) series is arranged alphabetically and largely follows the arrangement of the original accession. Unlike the 1992 accession, files relating to Divisions are interspersed with the rest of the series. The materials in this series reflect Chief Administrator Chris Durovich's activities (such as the Administrator's Retreat, Clinical Departmental Administrators Meetings, DAAD (Division Administrators and Directors) Meetings, Division Chiefs Meetings, Professional Billing, Reimbursement Subcommittee, Redesign Coordinating Group). Managed care was also an important issue during these years, as well as concern with patient satisfaction and quality assurance. Users should be aware that this accession contained no files with titles between the letters H and N, and so there are no files for Divisions such as Infectious Diseases, Medical Genetics, or Nephrology.</p>

          <p>The Financial Files (1.0 linear feet) series is arranged alphabetically, beginning with general year folders. This series contains extensive documentation of an application for a Ryan White Grant in 1996. The grant title was "HIV Early Intervention Services," and it was application for a grant under the Ryan White Title III (b) Program administered by the Bureau of Primary Health Care. This was a program funded "to increase primary health services to HIV infected patients" and was intended to assist low-income patients. These two folders contain the entire grant application and associated materials.</p>
