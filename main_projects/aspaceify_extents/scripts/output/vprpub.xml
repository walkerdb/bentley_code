          <p>The Unit Publications series contains printed material published specifically by the Office of the Vice President for Research. These publications are defined as being widely distributed and may be published at regular intervals. They are arranged by genre of the publication.</p>
          <p>Unit Publications (1.5 linear feet) include annual reports, brochures, budgets, ephemera including flyers, invitations, posters, and programs, manuals, newsletters, policy statements, presentations and reports. The annual reports include those written for the Board of Regents, under the titles <title render="italic">Research Report to the Board of Regents</title>, <title render="italic">Report to the Regents</title>, and <title render="italic">Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity at the University of Michigan: Annual Report to the Regents</title>, date from 1986 to 1999. These publications highlight the various types of research, detail expenditures, and summarize research proposals done by the faculty and staff of the University of Michigan. Researchers should consult the annual "presentations" made to the Board of Regents by the Vice President for Research for more concise report on research and scholarly activity.</p>
          <p>In 1996 this presentation was entitled <title render="italic">Research Expenditures, Sponsored Proposals and Awards</title>. The presentation to the Regents in 1997 was <title render="italic">Research and Scholarly Activities: A Presentation to the Regents</title>. <title render="italic">Support for Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities: Annual Financial Report</title>, documents the period from 1988 to 1998 and summarizes Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) funding allocations by unit, expense category (equipment, salaries, student support, supplies, and travel), academic division, rank of applicant (assistant, associate, and full professors, research scientists, curators, lecturers, and research investigators), gender, and race.</p>
          <p>The 1994 and 1996 <title render="italic">Report to the Executive Officers</title> highlight the activities and functions of the OVPR for that year, including initiating information and discussion sessions on responsibility in the conduct and administration of research; conducting open forums to discuss updates in technology, to review new policies toward human subjects, and to assess the impact of Value-Centered Management (VCM) on interdisciplinary research; and developing the OVPR website to provide information about the University of Michigan research program and its policies.</p>
          <p>There are several manuals included in the publications. The <title render="italic">Funding for Scholarly Activity</title> published from 1992 through 1993 includes information about funding available from the OVPR, the Rackham School of Graduate Studies and the University Council of International Academic Affairs. <title render="italic">Research and Scholarship Support Available from the Office of the Vice President for Research</title> published in 1986 has similar information from the OVPR only. The 1982 and 1987 <title render="italic">Intellectual Property Manual</title> define intellectual property and describe the university's policy, procedures, and the inventor's responsibilities to the university as does the related 1978 <title render="italic">Patent Manual</title>. <title render="italic">University of Michigan Research and Development Resources: A Guide for Businesses</title> published in 1993, serves as a ready reference guide to the resources that the university can offer small businesses including special conferences, economic development advice, affiliate programs and partnerships, and placement offices and co-op education programs. Newsletters such as the single issue of <title render="italic">OVPR Newsletter</title> give the latest news in the vice president's office in 1991 and the <title render="italic">OVPR Bulletin</title> dating from 1994 to 1996 describe not only what is going on in the area of research at the university, but also how Homer Neal, Vice President for Research, saw issues in the area of research, such as integrity of scholarship, financial conflicts of interest, accountability, and federal funding. The policy statements include an <title render="italic">Interim Policy Statement on The Integrity of Scholarship and Investigating Allegations of Misconduct in the Pursuit of Scholarship and Research</title> published in 1986, under the leadership of Linda Wilson, to encourage "ethical practices in scholarship." In 1993 Vice President Homer Neal issued a <title render="italic">Policy and Program Update for Primary Research Staff</title>. This update pulled policy statements, from the Board of Regents Bylaws, the <title render="italic">Standard Practice Guide</title>, the Affirmative Action Office, the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program, and the Family Care Resources Office, together in one place as a ready-reference for primary researchers on campus.</p>
          <p>The reports include a 1972 report <title render="italic">Indirect Costs of Research</title>, from the Office of the Vice President for Research at the request of the Commission of Resource Allocation to clarify the policies and procedures governing reimbursement of indirect costs to the university. In 1986 the <title render="italic">Technology Transfer at the University of Michigan: Reality from Vision; the Plan that is Working</title> was released. This report discusses the work of the Intellectual Property Office. <title render="italic">Environmental and Hazardous Substances Research</title>, published in 1990, describes research by the Michigan Universities Consortium for Hazardous Waste Management. This consortium of researchers from the University of Michigan and Michigan State University focused on the multidisciplinary activities needed to conduct research on the complex hazardous substances problems in the state. The report includes a directory of researchers, their research projects, and funding sources, bulletins describing graduate programs, and a breakdown of research funding.</p>

          </p>
          <p>The Sub-Unit Publications series (1.5 linear feet) includes single folders of publications from the following sub-units of the Vice President for Research:</p>
          <p>These publications may include announcements, annual reports, brochures, directories, festschrift, flyers, histories, invitations, manuals, newsletters, programs, proceedings, reports, and statistics.</p>
          <p>Other units reporting to the Vice President for Research, who have a greater quantity of publications held by the Bentley Historical Library, include the Center for Human Growth and Development, the Center for the Study of Complex Systems, the Detroit Observatory, the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, Jerome B. Wiesner Symposium, Planning Committee for the Merger (of duties between the Vice President for Research and the Dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies), and the Substance Abuse Center.</p>
          <p>There are twelve folders of publications from the Center for Human Growth and Development including annual reports spanning from 1980 to 1998, brochures, calendars, and flyers. The manual entitled <title render="italic">Resource Guide for Development and Aging</title> published in 1989 is also in this sub-unit. There are newsletters from 1972 to 1973, and 1981. The 1963 proposal for the center and the presentation to the Regents is also included. There is a single 1994 report entitled <title render="italic">Longitudinal Studies of Human Behavior</title> detailing the various studies conducted by the Center for Human Growth and Development.</p>
          <p>The Center for the Study of Complex Systems contains four folders of publications including a festschrift honoring John C. Holland published in 1999. There are also folders of flyers advertising John C. Holland's short course in the fall of 2001 and seminars sponsored by the center. In 2001 an external review of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems was issued.</p>
          <p>The Detroit Observatory publications are divided into nine folders. The bulk of the publications are reports dating from 1996 to 1997 describing the restoration of the Observatory. There is also a history by director and curator Patricia Whitesell entitled <title render="italic">A Creation of His Own: Tappan's Detroit Observatory</title>, published in 1998. There are also folders of development brochures from 1996 and flyers advertising lectures and programs sponsored by the Detroit Observatory from 1999 to 2002.</p>
          <p>The Institute for Research on Women and Gender (IRWG) publications are included in five folders. There is a brochure, entitled <title render="italic">Stories from Lane Hall</title>, compiled in 2000 to celebrate the new home of the institute and the Women's Studies Program. There is a folder of e-mail printout calendars describing the activities sponsored by IRWG. There are also newsletters, <title render="italic">News from the Institute for Research on Women and Gender at the University of Michigan</title>, covering the period from 1996 to 1997 and posters, dating from 1997 to 2002, advertising speakers sponsored by the institute.</p>
          <p>The Jerome B. Wiesner Symposium was created to honor the memory of a noted alumnus of the university and to continue the dialogue on the future of the government/university partnership in research. The four folders include programs documenting the symposium from 1996 to 1999. The Bentley Historical Library has published copies of the proceedings from the 1996 symposium <title render="italic">The Future of the Government/University Partnership</title> and the 1999 forum, <title render="italic">New Integrations of Research, Scholarship, and Undergraduate Education</title>. There is also a copy of the 1999 workshop abstracts.</p>
          <p>In 1983, President Shapiro recommended that a committee be created to analyze the possibility of merging the offices of Vice President for Research and Dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. The Planning Committee for the Merger was created, as well as two subcommittees. There are three reports found in the publications of the Vice President for Research. In the end the merger was not implemented.</p>
          <p>The Substance Abuse Center coordinates an interdisciplinary effort to stimulate, integrate, and coordinate the study of psychoactive substance abuse, working to understand the mechanisms and develop policies for prevention of abuse. (<title render="italic">A Self Study Report</title>, vol. 1, p. 4) The six folders of publications for this sub-unit cover the period from 1989 to 1994. Included is a 1989 campus-wide directory listing the various substance abuse-related research activities, prevention and treatment centers, and educational programs offered by the various university units. The 1986 report entitled <title render="italic">Feasibility of Establishing a Substance Abuse Center for Research, Education and Service at the University of Michigan</title> includes the proposal for the center. The center's name changed in 1995 to Substance Abuse Research Center to reflect its primary function on campus. In 1996 the research center developed a two volume <title render="italic">Self Study Report</title> including an in-depth report on the center's mission statement, activities, organization, budget, annual reports from 1988 to 1993, organization chart, resumes of staff members with their job descriptions, and history.</p>
