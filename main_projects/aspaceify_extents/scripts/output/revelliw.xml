    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>William D. Revelli, "the Chief" to his many students, was born in Spring Gulch, Colorado, February 1902. The son of Italian immigrants, Giovanni (later anglicized to John) and Rose Bonino, William Donald was the third of seven children. In 1904, John moved his family to Illinois to take a position as a mine foreman in Panama.</p>
      <p>Revelli began to play the violin after age 5 years. (Gregory Talford. "William D. Revelli: An Introspective Study," Masters Thesis 1985, p. 6; hereafter Talford [Catalogued separately]). After graduating from high school in 1918, Revelli went to college at the Chicago Musical College. He studied the violin under Leon Sametini, and trained for a career playing in the orchestras of the movie theaters of Chicago. (Talford, p.12) In 1922, Revelli was awarded a bachelor of music degree in violin performance. The following year he married Mary Endrietto Vidano. She remained with Revelli until her death in 1992.</p>
      <p>Upon graduation, Revelli enrolled in the Columbia School of Music in Chicago in music education. He did his student teaching at the elementary and junior high school levels, and received a degree in public school music in 1925. (Talford, 16) Following his graduation, Revelli attended the Vander Cook School of Directing.</p>
      <p>Revelli accepted the position of high school band director of Hobart High School Band, Hobart, Indiana, in 1925. The band began with three instruments. Revelli brought the number to twenty-two members by the time of their first concert in January 1926. (Hobart Gazette, July 1, 1981; Box 2) Four years later, Hobart High School Band captured the Indiana Class "B" band championship. By the time Revelli left Hobart in 1935, the band was seventy pieces strong. He frequented Hobart often, giving guest appearances and encouragement to the band over the years. (Hobart Gazette, July 1, 1981; Box 2)</p>
      <p>Revelli was hired as Conductor of Bands and Assistant Professor of Wind Instruments by the University of Michigan in 1935. Edwin Franko Goldman once said to the band members, "Give him your whole-hearted support, and Michigan's band will be the finest of its kind in the world." (University of Michigan, "25 Years of Leadership," Pamphlet in 25th Anniversary Friendship Book, p. 2; Box 1)</p>
      <p>"William's musicianship, dedication, drive and energy have become recognized by virtually every honor the band world could bestow on the University of Michigan." ("25 Years of Leadership," p. 2) Revelli inspired awe, fear, and determination in his students. Someone once suggested that the essence of true leadership was the ability to inspire others to want to follow.</p>
      <p>Revelli was once asked to describe his amazing capacity for teaching others about music. "My first teaching point has nothing to do with the instrument; it starts out with attitude. What is attitude? Attitude starts with interest, enthusiasm, dedication, cooperation, and outlook. The conductor has a responsibility to create an attitude of love for music. You are not a conductor of bands, you're a conductor of people." (Talford, p. 276-77)</p>
      <p>The two tours the University of Michigan's Symphony Band gave in 1961 and 1971 were probably the two crowning achievements in Revelli's career. In 1961, Revelli led the University of Michigan's Symphony Band on a goodwill tour of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. At the height of the Cold War, the response to the tour by the Soviet people was tremendous. Appearances were sold out throughout the tour. People commented on how outstanding the University Symphony performed at every location. No one had ever heard a band of this type performing so flawlessly. The caliber of each performance was outstanding. (Talford, p. 169)</p>
      <p>Revelli officially retired as Conductor of Bands in 1971. He appeared frequently with the University Marching Band until his death in 1994. Revelli Hall was dedicated on October 20, 1973 to honor the man who made the University of Michigan's Marching Band one of the premier bands in the country. In the last years of his life, Revelli appeared in as many as one hundred guest conductor assignments each year. Even 1994, the year of his death, saw Revelli conducting several performances.</p>
      <p>Revelli's contributions to his profession and his awards were numerous, including: president of the American Bandmasters Association; founder and president, and honorary life president of the College Band Directors National Association; a member of the screening committee of the music advisory panel of the American National Theater and Academy; Honorary National Grand President of Kappa Kappa Psi, honorary band fraternity; John Philip Sousa Recipient for Outstanding Band Direction, and other awards and honoraria.</p>

          <p>Other Professional Activities (Box 3-5) is the fourth series in the Revelli Papers. Clinics and Writings comprise a large part of this series, the largest of the Revelli Papers. Here the researcher will find a survey of wind instrument literature by Revelli. Revelli wrote brief march compositions, a faculty research project entitled "International Band Instrumentation," and various articles written between 1938-1990. There is one folder of articles (1938-1956) written for the music magazine Etude in this series. Festival of Music programs (1982-1989), International Band programs (miscellaneous years), and the Michigan School Band and Orchestra Association programs are found in this series. The Band Conductors Conferences files are also included in the series. The series covers the years 1949-1966. Researchers will find valuable information on the history of a band organization in this series.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series is comprised of photographs and motion pictures. Many of the photographs concern the University of Michigan Marching, Symphony, and Alumni bands, in practice or in concert. From Rose Bowl appearances (1947-1949), the Eastern European/Soviet Union Symphonic Band Tour (1961), to the ground breaking ceremonies of Revelli Hall (1973), the photograph series documents interesting facets of Revelli the man and the maestro. Some of the photographs are oversized, including photographs of Hill Auditorium, and a portrait of the American composer/conductor Percy Granger. The most interesting oversized item is a copy of the Alfred Eisenstadt photograph of drum major Dick Smith in 1950 for <title render="italic">LIFE Magazine</title> magazine. A video tape and slides are also included in the Visual Materials series.</p>
          <p>Films also comprise a segment of this series (Box 8). There are thirteen films, eight black and white films, and five color films. All films are silent. Each film documents performances of the University of Michigan Marching Band. The twelfth film, taken at UCLA and at Michigan State University, is of particular interest. It provides a good shot of Revelli conducting the University of Michigan Band.</p>
