      <p>The University Library system at the University of Michigan provides information resources and services to faculty, students, staff, and the public, and is comprised of undergraduate, graduate, and subject-oriented divisional collections. One of the leading research library systems in the world, the library holds over seven million volumes and a wide variety of cartographic, audiovisual, manuscript, microform, and digital materials.</p>
      <p>The idea for the University Library was conceived in the university's earliest stages. The Act of 1837, which provided for the organization of the university, included a provision stating that a portion of student fees would go toward increasing the library. The Board of Regents elected a faculty member, the Reverend Henry Colclazer, to serve as librarian. A year later, in September 1838, the Regents passed a resolution authorizing Asa Gray, Professor of Botany and Zoology, to purchase the materials to serve as the basis for the library's collection while on a tour of Europe, and appropriated $5000 for this purpose. While in London, Gray commissioned George Palmer Putnam to select most of the materials, developing a collection of 3,401 volumes covering the subjects of history, philosophy, literature, science, the arts, and law (the complete list of titles was printed as a state document in 1841). The library at U-M is unusual in that, unlike most academic libraries, it was established through a major purchase rather than a gift.</p>
      <p>In November 1841, just after the university opened for classes, the Regents approved the Regulations for the Library, which included that the library would be open once a week, that no books be loaned to students without faculty approval, that fines were to be paid for overdue books, and that no more than two volumes could be borrowed at a time. Initially housed in the home of one of the university's professors, the books were moved to the third floor of the Main Building in December 1841.</p>
      <p>Aside from small additions of books and periodicals, the library's collection remained fairly static until 1854, when President Henry Tappan initiated a subscription drive among Ann Arbor residents to raise funds for acquisitions and called for an annual appropriation from the Regents. These acts brought a steady infusion of money to ensure ongoing collection development. After years of having a succession of faculty members serve annual terms as the librarian, Tappan's son, John L. Tappan, was appointed as full-time librarian in 1856, and effectively became the first Librarian of the University.</p>
      <p>As the library's collections grew, the library continually outgrew the space afforded it. After a series of shared homes, including spaces in the North University Building and the Law Building, in 1881 the state legislature appropriated $100,000 for the library to have its own purpose-built building. Opened in 1883 and located in the center of campus, the library consisted of a large reading room attached to cruciform stacks. When the library outgrew that space and several additions, in 1915 the university secured over $350,000 (later supplemented by additional appropriations) from the legislature for a new building to be designed by Albert Kahn. The existing library was demolished, and a new General Library building opened in 1920. Several divisional libraries, including collections devoted to rare books, natural science, chemical engineering, education, and museums were also established during this time period. Some of these collections were housed within the General Library while others were hosted out of academic departments or other buildings on campus.</p>
      <p>Over the years the directors of the University Library made a number of important contributions to the development of the library and the larger field of library and information science. Andrew Ten Brook (1864-1877) introduced the library's first card catalog, with handwritten author and subject cards for both books and periodical articles. Raymond C. Davis (1877-1905) directed increased collection development and oversaw the opening of the first General Library building. Theodore W. Koch (1905-1915) developed the library's first reference collection and instituted a library orientation program. William Warner Bishop (1915-1941), nationally recognized as one of the country's leading librarians, presided over the establishment of the Library Extension Service, the opening of the new General Library in 1920, the development of substantial divisional and specialized collections, and a number of cataloging innovations, in addition to leading the university's first Department of Library Science and serving terms as the presidents of the American Library Association (ALA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA).</p>
      <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, the way in which the library provided services to the academic community evolved. Whereas once the General Library had served as the major research center for all academic subjects on campus, as the university's academic programs expanded and the need for collections to support those programs grew, the General Library's role came to be seen more as providing support solely for the humanities and social sciences. Specialized divisional libraries and libraries that provided services targeted to particular groups of patrons began to grow to support all other subjects. Rather than conceiving of them as small collections that supplemented the General Library, the library began developing larger and more self-contained divisional libraries, including the Physics-Astronomy Library, the first divisional library to be purpose-built rather than housed in a building designed for other purposes. As the network of campus libraries grew larger, the entire system came to be known as the University Library system.</p>
      <p>The most important new library built in this time period was the Undergraduate Library, which opened in 1958. Designed to house a select collection of standard works commonly consulted by undergraduate students, the Undergraduate Library was the first large open-stack library on campus (though many of the divisional libraries already had open stacks). The Undergraduate Library differed from other libraries on campus in that it contained space for students to read, listen to recordings, and meet with others, as well as reference services specifically geared to undergraduate students. Open stacks were subsequently introduced in the General Library. These innovations led to increased library use and circulation on campus.</p>
      <p>A seven-level addition to the General Library was constructed in 1970. The new addition nearly doubled the General Library's capacity, and provided added space for users and staff. While originally only the South Building was to be given a new name, soon after its opening the entire complex housing the North and South Buildings came to be called the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. New divisional libraries were also constructed in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably the Taubman Medical Library in 1979.</p>
      <p>In the 1970s, the University Library system began a program of automated cataloging through the Michigan Library Consortium. Automation became fully integrated into library operations in August 1988, when the library's online catalog MIRLYN (Michigan Research Library Network) was introduced. The retrospective conversion of card catalog data was funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and included over 10 million bibliographic records, covering 99% of the library's collections.</p>
      <p>The University Library continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most significant developments during the decade was the establishment of the library's Digital Library Services in 1993, which develops and maintains digital resources to support research and instruction and provides technology management services for the University Library system. Another important accomplishment was the library's participation in the campus-wide initiative led by President James Duderstadt to design the Media Union on North Campus. Opened in 1996, the Media Union houses the Art and Architecture and Engineering Libraries, and hosts and provides services for an extensive array of innovative digital tools and resources. Under the leadership of Paul Courant (University Librarian from 2007-2013), the University Library expanded its digital collections through its participation in the Google digitization project (an ambitious initiative to digitize all the books in the library) and the creation of HathiTrust Shared Digital Repository.</p>
      <p>The University Library continues to be one of the leading research libraries in the world, with innovative programs in digital library services, access, and reference, and nearly unparalleled depth and breadth of collections. For more information on the University Library, please consult its website at http://www.lib.umich.edu. In addition, several resources available at the Bentley Library provide detailed histories of the library. For a concise history of the University of Michigan Library to 1958 the interested researcher should consult <title render="italic">The University of Michigan, An Encyclopedic Survey</title>, vol. 3. A comprehensive history of the library can be gleaned from the <title render="italic">University of Michigan President's Report</title> published annually from 1853 to 1984, as well as the 1982 report from the University Library's Collection Analysis Project (found in this record group, Box 188). Consult the printed catalog for these and other historical summaries.</p>
      <p>(Please note that some of the libraries at the University of Michigan are not part of the University Library system. These include the Law Library, the Kresge Business Administration Library, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, the Clements Library, and the Bentley Historical Library. Individual findings aids for the record groups of most of these libraries can be found at the Bentley Library.)</p>

          <p>The Director's Office subgroup constitutes the largest portion of the Library record group. It is made of a Topical Files series which is divide into a number subseries reflecting the various accessions in which the records received. There is some overlap in the date coverage of the subseries and an annual Reports series.</p>
          <p>The Director's Office Files, 1980-2013 (bulk 1998-2005) continues the series from previous accessions. Records in this series span the tenures of Richard M. Dougherty, Robert M. Warner, Don E. Riggs, William A. Gosling, and Paul Courant. However, the majority of the records originate from William A. Gosling's term as Director and Dean of the University Library. The series is divided into two sub-series: Topical Files and Budget Files.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files consist of materials concerning official library business and the directors' professional activities and consulting work . Each subseries represents a separate accession of materials but when taken together they create a continuous file from 1905 to 1999. These series primarily consist of intra-university correspondence and correspondence with library donors, with other libraries around the world, with state and national library organizations, and with vendors.</p>
            <p>In each of the subseries, the alphabetical arrangement devised by the director's office has been retained, although there are inconsistencies in it. Researchers should note that government agencies and other organizations are arranged hierarchically (e.g. "U.S. Library of Congress" and "Michigan. University. Library-Staff"), but this rule is not always applied, and material related to the two examples given can also be found directly under "Library of Congress" and "Staff", respectively. Organizations which have changed their names are usually found under all successive names. Material concerning the University of Michigan Library can be found under "General Library," "Michigan. University. General Library," and "Michigan. University. Library."</p>

              <p>The 1950-1957 subseries contains the office files of library directors Rice and Wagman. The materials concerning Frederick Wagman's work with the National Union Catalog (boxes 52 and 75) and the National Library of Medicine (boxes 114-115, 142) are particularly interesting. Wagman's daily diaries for 1953 to 1957 are found in box 126. These diaries served both as appointment books and notebooks in which Wagman recorded brief analyses of the meetings he attended.</p>

              <p>Additional records from director Frederick Wagman’s tenure from the 1957-1967 subseries and two separate subseries covering the years 1965-1978. The materials found in 1965-1978 subseries represent a continuation of the 1957-1967 subseries, with some overlap in dates and with the same alphabetical arrangement and folder headings. The two subseries are, in fact, one working unit, distinct only in that they were accessioned into the university archives at different times. These materials comprise both office files and materials relating to Wagman's other professional activities. Noteworthy are the materials concerning Wagman's work with the National Advisory Commission on Libraries (112-113), and the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography (boxes 85-89). Wagman's daily diaries for the period 1967 to 1977 are found in box 160.</p>

              <p>The 1978-1988 subseries contains the office files of Richard Dougherty. A number of accessions were merged into one run of topical files. During Dougherty's tenure as director, the library's administrative structure was streamlined and several major automated systems such as MIRLYN (MIchigan Research LibrarY Network) and RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network), were installed to handle key operations in the areas of acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation. Dougherty's files provide strong documentation on various aspects of these transformations in the library during the 1980s.</p>

              <p>The Director's Office Files contain files of three directors: Frederick H. Wagman, Richard M. Dougherty, and Robert M. Warner. All of these files are in an alphabetical topical arrangement. Of particular note in the Wagman files are library organizational charts spanning 1962-1977 and seven folders of Staff Circulars. These circulars provide documentation into library policies and procedures and the changes that evolved in them over the tenure of Wagman's directorship.</p>
              <p>The files of Richard M. Dougherty encompass the largest portion of this series. The content of the files is varied, covering a wide range of library topics and issues. Perhaps the greatest interest can be found in the six Serials Differential Pricing folders. These illustrate the approach the University Library took with regard to rising serials prices. Dougherty was one of the leaders nationally in addressing this issue in libraries.</p>
              <p>The files of Robert M. Warner are comprised of three brief topical files.</p>

              <p>The Director’s Topical Files, 1978-1997 (bulk 1988-1995) (13.5 linear feet) consist of records maintained centrally in the administrative suite of the library director/dean. The date ranges span the tenures of four directors (Richard Dougherty, Robert Warner, Donald Riggs, and the beginning of William Gosling’s tenure). The bulk of the records are from the directorships of Warner and Riggs. Arranged in a single alphabetical run, the records illuminate the management of one of the ten largest research libraries in the country, with 350 employees, several divisional libraries, and a budget of over $20 million in the mid-1990s.</p>
              <p>Notable themes covered within these records include the implementation of the online catalog (MIRLYN), expanding digital content and access, rising journal subscription costs, construction of the Information Technology Instruction Center (later Media Union) on North Campus, and staff and campus-wide diversity initiatives. Documentation of several key committees is found under the heading, "Library Governance," including the Dean's Cabinet, Library Council, and Management Advisory Council. These forums helped to establish and review policies as well as the allocation of staff and financial resources. Development files showcase efforts to aggressively raise funds to support the work of the library. One of the key development initiatives culminated in the creation of an endowed curator position for Judaica collections. The records also reflect involvement with state groups such as the Michigan Library Consortium, as well as national organizations such as the Research Library Group (RLG).</p>

              <p>The 1981-1998 subseries of the Director's Topical File (6.0 linear feet) continues the central files series from previous accessions. While the subseries includes material dating back to 1981, the majority of the files date from 1996 to 1998. The records include central files from the tenures of several library directors/deans, including Richard Dougherty, Robert Warner, Donald Riggs, and William Gosling, with the bulk of the material from Gosling's interim director and director terms. Of particular note are the files on the Digital Library program (including the licensing of electronic resources), development initiatives and the Media Union.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files, 1980-2005 series is divided into several sub-series according to date: 1980-1998 (bulk 1989-1998); 1998/99; 1999/00; 2000/01; 2001/02; and 2002-2005. Within each date range the files are organized alphabetically. A notable theme in the Topical Files sub-series is the University Library's efforts to provide new and improved library services through the creation and implementation of new technologies and information systems. Efforts like the Digital Library Initiative (DLI), and related projects, are well-documented. The records provide information on projects within the University of Michigan Library, as well as projects involving other institutions. There is also an abundance of material demonstrating the University Library's involvement with various organizations including the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), the Research Libraries Group (RLG), and the Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL), among several others.</p>

            <p>The Annual Reports subseries of the Director's Office subgroup consists of two types of annual reports: annual reports from the various library units to the library director, and the director's summary annual report sent to the president of the university. Arranged chronologically, these reports document the years 1947 to 1977. Both types of reports for additional years can be found within the various directors' office files. Moreover, a complete run of the library director's annual report to the president of the university can be found in the bound volumes of the President's Report for the period 1853 to 1984 (consult Bentley Historical Library Printed Works Catalog).</p>

          <p>Another member of the senior administrative team, the Associate Director for Technical Services has primary responsibility for maintaining bibliographic architecture and providing remote and on-site access in a variety of formats. The Associate Director for Technical Services Files (William Gosling), 1984-1997 (7.0 linear feet) document the tenure of William Gosling, who was later appointed interim director of the University Library in 1997 and then director in 1998. Gosling's files detail the implementation of MIRLYN and the management and licensing of other databases. The records also document preservation initiatives, acquisitions, and relationships with state and national organizations.</p>

          <p>The Assistant Director for Technical Services Files, 1984-1999, are the files of William Gosling. The crux of these files focuses on matters of concern relating to the technical services functions of the university library including cataloging policies. The Subgroup consists of a Topical File divided into two chronological spans covering the years 1984-1991 and 194-1996.</p>

          <p>The Miscellaneous Records series, despite its title, includes some very significant documentation of the founding and development of the University Library. The series is organized into three subseries:1937-1948, 1866-1985, and Correspondence Card Index.</p>

            <p>The Miscellaneous Records, 1837-1948 subseries is comprised of a body of material transferred to the archives on an item or folder basis. The unusual character of the transfer reflects upon the peculiar worth attached to many of the records. This small subseries contains miscellaneous records from the period 1837 to 1948. A run of faculty circulation records from the period 1864 to 1904 (boxes 70-71) offers a window onto the changing research interests of various faculty members as the university was developing into a major research institution. Also included in this series are the files of correspondence between University President Harry B. Hutchins and Library Director Theodore Wesley Koch from 1910 to 1920 which document decisions made about the library's budget, acquisitions, and administrative policies (box 69).</p>

            <p>The Correspondence Card Index is an index to the correspondence files of library directors (boxes 149-154). This card file functions as an index to correspondence received from about 1911 to 1985, and is arranged alphabetically. Headings include both proper names and subject terms. The card directs the user to a particular folder title and year.</p>

          <p>The Associate Director's Office subgroup consists of a topical file covering the years 1982-1989. Some of this material duplicates that found in the directors' files. Much of it, however, is more detailed and should be used to supplement issues documented in the directors' files. The files of several previous assistant directors (assistant librarians), F.L.D. Goodrich (1911-1933), Samuel W. McAllister (1927-1959), and Robert H. Muller (1953-1967) are included in the appropriate director's office files.</p>

          <p>The Collection Development Office subgroup consists of Topical Files, Materials Selection Policy Committee Files, and Book Funds/Budget Files. The original alphabetic order of the series has been maintained. Many, but not all of the filing inconsistencies have been removed. Of special note are the materials which document the findings of the Library's Collection Analysis Project conducted in the early 1980s (boxes 188-189), and the run of financial records (boxes 194-195) which document the changing allocations of the book funds over a thirty-year period.</p>

          <p>The Deputy Director's Files, 1980-1991 consist of the files of Carla Stoffle whose duties as Deputy Director were primarily concerned with internal library policy and management issues. Her appointment in this position allowed library director Dougherty to concentrate on the growing external library issues. Consequently the files in this series focus on a wide array of internal and local concerns. Many of the memos and reports in these files have been annotated by Stoffle. This series is arranged in alphabetical topical files largely retaining the arrangement of the files devised by the Deputy Director's office.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files, 1980-2010 series is divided into several sub-series according to date: 1980-1998 (bulk 1989-1998); 1998/99; 1999/00; 2000/01; 2001/02; and 2002-2005. Within each date range the files are organized alphabetically. A notable theme in the Topical Files sub-series is the University Library's efforts to provide new and improved library services through the creation and implementation of new technologies and information systems. Efforts like the Digital Library Initiative (DLI), and related projects, are well-documented. The records provide information on projects within the University of Michigan Library, as well as projects involving other institutions. There is also an abundance of material demonstrating the University Library's involvement with various organizations including the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), the Research Libraries Group (RLG), and the Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL), among several others.</p>

              <p>Much of the material in the Photographs and Negatives series was used to illustrate library publications, and in particular the development-themed <title render="italic">Illuminator</title>. Photographs of several athletic personalities such as football coach Bo Schembechler, basketball coach Steve Fisher, and men's hockey captain Brendan Morrison, reflect on efforts to forge ties between the library and athletic department. Creation of the Hermelin Curator of Judaica is chronicled in photographs and related events such as the speech and presentation of Judaica material by Holocaust survivor Joseph Adler.</p>

The bulk of the records are from 1984 to 1990. Both Stoffle and Crist eventually left the library to serve as library directors at major research universities. The files reflect the close working arrangement between the library director and the associate director. These records provide a higher level of detail than what is found within similarly named files in the Director's Office series. The files richly illustrate the various branch and divisional libraries along with efforts to provide greater service and enhanced bibliographic instruction. The Subgroup consists of a Topical File divided in to two chronological subseries: 1976-1993 and 1988-1998</p>
          <p>The 1988-1998 subseries (0.25 linear feet) of the Assistant Director for Public Services Files, is comprised of a small set of files from the Margo Crist's tenure as AD for Public Services. Of particular note are the folders related to the work of the University Library Strategic Planning Committee in the early 1990s.</p>

            <p>Construction and Building Files, 1969-1977 (1.0 linear foot) document two major construction initiatives. The first relates to the addition to the Graduate Library (Harlan Hatcher annex) and related renovations from 1969 to 1976. Files include information on design and planning as well as the logistics of moving stacks and offices. The second project documented is planning for the construction of what would become the A. Alfred Taubman Medical Library. These documents are pre-construction and date from 1975 to 1978.</p>

            <p>Begun as a pilot project to deliver research information for community and economic development to every public library in Michigan, M-Link received a $625,000 grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation in 1994 to expand the program to some 600 public libraries throughout the state. Using e-mail or telefax, all public libraries in Michigan were able to send information requests that cannot be answered at the local level to M-Link librarians and staff. M-LINK, 1987-1997 (1.4 linear feet) records include annual reports, evaluation of services and effectiveness, sample reference inquiries, and topical files.</p>

            <p>The Science Libraries, 1936-1990 (1.0 linear foot) series brings together diverse information on the various science and divisional libraries, both on campus and in satellite locations off campus. The records indicate issues and challenges unique to science libraries. A run of annual reports beginning in 1936 offers rich information on the Mathematics Library and the Natural Resources and Natural Science Libraries. The latter also includes information on the forestry library. Documentation is also available for the McMath-Hulbert Observatory library as well as the closure of the Bureau of Government Library.</p>

            <p>A landmark effort to microfilm and catalog all English books published between 1475 and 1640, the Short Title Catalog project partnered the University of Michigan with University Microfilms. Filmed by University Microfilms, the titles were cataloged by the university and subscriptions were sold to libraries throughout the world. The Short Title Catalog, 1939-1992 records (1.0 linear foot) include correspondence with subscribing libraries, cataloging decisions, and the work of University Microfilms.</p>

            <p>Unlike the files of the Associate Director for Technical Services, the records in the Technical Services, 1948-1986 (1.0 linear foot) series represent several different records creators and sources. Statistical reports, technical services manuals, and information on the bindery comprise the bulk of this series. Budgets and statistics of the bindery operation date from 1948 to 1975.</p>

            <p>The Collection Management and Development Committee Council (CMDC) series, 1982-1999 contains files, organized alphabetically, relating to the activities and functions of the CMDC. The CMDC is comprised of seventy subject specialists who are responsible for resource acquisitions, collection management, and service for their designated areas of subject responsibility (University Library, Collection Development Overview). Along with several files containing meeting agendas, minutes, and background materials, there are also files documenting the committee's involvement in library events and policy development. Of particular interest is the increasing involvement with the acquisition and management of electronic resources. Some files referring to this issue include the files on the Campus Wide Information System (CWIS), the Digital Library Project, Electronic Journals, the Electronic Resources Handbook, JSTOR, and Web Sites Cataloging.</p>

            <p>The Diversity Committee series, 1988-2004 includes introductory materials related to the committee, photographs of the October 1998 Diversity Celebration, and Diversity Committee meeting minutes. Also included are several General folders, dated 1988-2004, that contain additional information on the committee's activities, and provide supplemental information to the meeting minutes. The University of Michigan Library Diversity Committee had its roots as the Diversity Task Force, which was formed in 1985. In 1989 the ad hoc Diversity Task Force became more formalized and a permanent Library Diversity Committee was formed. The Diversity Committee's mission includes advising library administration, acting as a resource for library staff, and implementing activities promoting diversity within the library (Library Diversity Committee web site).</p>

            <p>The Library Information Technology (LIT) series, 1985-2002 (bulk 1993-2002) is organized alphabetically, and contains an abundance of material on the University Library's efforts to increase and improve the use of technology as a library tool. LIT is a program focused on the development and maintenance of digital resources and the provision of technology management services and support for the University Library system (LIT website). This series is a nice complement to the DIRECTOR'S OFFICE FILES series, providing additional materials on many of the digital initiatives underway in the library at that time. As with the Director's Office Files, there is a wealth of material on the Digital Library Initiative (DLI). Other notable topics include the Pricing Electronic Access to Knowledge (PEAK) field experiment, which was conducted to investigate new pricing and product plans for electronic journals (PEAK web site), and the creation of Making of America (MOA), a digital library of primary sources in America social History from the antebellum period through reconstruction (MOA home page). There are also several files containing information on the library's involvement with JSTOR, and with a variety of projects through the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC).</p>

            <p>The Loup, Jean Files series, 1977-2001 (bulk 1992-2001) is organized alphabetically and contains files related to the career and activities of librarian Jean Loup. Loup held several different offices and roles during her time with the University Library including assistant to the library dean, head of the Department of Communications, Public Relations, and Grant Writing, chair of the Academic Affairs Advisory Committee (AAAC), library delegate to the Senate Assembly, vice-chair and chair of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA), and leader in many projects including M-Quality (Regent's Proceedings). Topics that are particularly well-documented in this series include the AAAC (especially during Loup's tenure as chair), and M-Quality, a campus-wide initiative designed to encourage continuous improvement in everyday tasks (<title render="italic">Record</title> article).</p>

            <p>The Staff Handbooks subseries, 1956-1987, traces the evolution of library policies from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. The staff manuals were regularly updated as library policies, such as purchasing books, library keys, and authorizing travel funds, changed. The manuals detail changing procedures for Administration, Collection Development, Personnel, Reader Services, Special Staff Circulation, and Technical Services. Organizational Charts are included in the Staff Manuals.</p>

            <p>The Library Position Classifications subseries, 1963-1991(bulk 1971-1979), is organized alphabetically and chronologically. Administrative files are arranged alphabetically and precede position description materials. Administrative files detail the position evaluation process and reconsideration requests. Position description materials are organized chronologically. Records contain detailed descriptions of job summary, work performed, periodic duties, job qualifications, education, and experience. During the 1970s, the library went through a significant restructuring period. The records in this sub-series shed light on the changing needs of the library and its staff.</p>

            <p>The Internship Programs subseries, 1983-2001 , is organized chronologically. The records highlight two programs: Research Library Residency Program and Library Minority Training Internship Program (LM TIP or TIP). The Internship Programs subseries includes photographs and negatives in Box 293.</p>
            <p>Records for the Research Library Residency Program highlight the internal proposal process, recruitment, and seminar series associated with the residency program. Research Library Residents held a two-year , non-continuing professional appointment. The residency program included a Seminar Series created to introduce residents to the wide range issues shaping research libraries. Records include materials from the recruitment process, library division proposals, resident application materials, seminar materials, and seminar exit surveys.</p>
            <p>Library Minority Training Internship Program's (LM TIP) records detail the origins of the program as well as some of the challenges faced by minority library staff. LM TIP was developed to recruit, train, and mentor people of color for library positions. The program sought a diverse pool of applicants not only from the University of Michigan Personnel sources, but also from local churches, campus organizations, and multi-cultural organizations throughout Southeastern Michigan. Internship positions ran between 9 months and 2 years.</p>
