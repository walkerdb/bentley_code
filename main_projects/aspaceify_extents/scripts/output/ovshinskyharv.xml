    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Harvey Ovshinsky was born on April 9, 1948 to Stanford and Norma Ovshinsky and grew up in northwest Detroit, Mich. From an early age, Ovshinsky exhibited a passion for writing. Shortly after his parents' divorce in 1959, Stanford Ovshinsky and his second wife Iris gave Ovshinsky a small printing press, enabling him to print his own newsletters. While attending Mumford High school, Ovshinsky continued to write and self-publish. He also worked after school at Mumford Music, a neighborhood music store owned by his mother's second husband, Adolph Marks. Ovshinsky thrived on the experience of the diverse community that frequented the music store. Further, working at Mumford Music strengthened the teenaged Ovshinsky's sense of connection with the culture of Detroit. He was devastated when his mother and stepfather decided to move their family to Los Angeles in 1965.</p>
      <p>While in Los Angeles, Ovshinsky worked with the <title render="italic">LA Free Press</title>, one of the most broadly distributed underground newspapers of the 1960s. This job, combined with homesickness, sparked his dream to found a similar newspaper in Detroit. He returned home that same year and founded <title render="italic">The Fifth Estate</title>, Detroit's first underground newspaper. Ovshinsky briefly attended Monteith College at Wayne State University in Detroit while simultaneously running <title render="italic"/> the newspaper, but eventually dropped his classes to focus on <title render="italic">The Fifth Estate</title>. The fledgling newspaper expanded with the help of anti-war activist Peter Werbe and the Detroit Committee to End the War in Vietnam. </p>
      <p>Ovshinsky left <title render="italic">The Fifth Estate</title> in April 1968. By the time of his departure, most of the staff held more radical views than Ovshinsky, who was more interested in promoting community and communication than social revolution. Ovshinsky began two years of alternative service work as a conscientious objector at the Lafayette Clinic, a state psychiatric hospital in Detroit. He started as a clerk and worked his way up to Attendant Nurse. While at Lafayette, he founded an independent self-help center called "Open City," intended to provide counseling, community, and medical and legal support to Detroit's youth. During his time at Lafayette Clinic, Ovshinsky also met his future wife, Cathie Kurek, who was working there as a psychiatric nurse. </p>
      <p>While still employed at the clinic, Ovshinsky launched a weekly morning talk show called <title render="italic">Spare Change</title> in 1969, which aired on an alternative Detroit radio station, WXYZ-FM. He was hired as news director at WABX-FM in Detroit the following year. Ovshinsky's work in media and communications soon expanded to television, when he left WABX and joined The Video Group in 1973 as a writer and producer. </p>
      <p>Quickly frustrated by the financial instability of The Video Group, Ovshinsky launched his own company, Creative Media Inc., in 1974, providing freelance writing and production services to businesses, advertising agencies, and television stations. While he enjoyed the freedom of working independently, financial difficulties led him to close the company in 1976 and return to work for a local television station, WXYZ-TV, in Detroit. In the decade to follow, Ovshinsky would continue to work on projects in both television and radio for stations such as WDIV-TV, WRIF-FM, and Detroit Public Television.</p>
      <p>In the early 1980s, Ovshinsky began writing original screenplays. These include <title render="italic">PJ and the Dragon</title> and <title render="italic">The Keyman</title>. In 1980, Ovshinsky also began teaching to bring in extra income for his own children's education. While working with elementary school children at Grosse Pointe Academy, Ovshinsky developed a passion for understanding how children learn through play, drawing, and dramatization, which led to his development of a proprietary approach to teaching through "physual" (physical plus visual) learning. This passion would later carry over to his efforts to create educational programming for children, such as <title render="italic">Pendragon's Park</title> and <title render="italic">The Mighty Hubble</title> . Ovshinsky also taught courses in screenwriting and creative writing at the university level, lecturing at the College for Creative Studies, Wayne State University, Madonna University, and Washtenaw Community College. </p>
      <p>In 1986, Ovshinsky founded HKO Media, which afforded him the opportunity to work on productions with a variety of clients, including former employers such as WTVS, WDIV-TV, and WXYZ-TV. With HKO, he was also able to realize his dream of producing "local-for-national" documentaries about Detroit, including <title render="italic">Voodoo Man of Heidelberg Street</title> (1990), <title render="italic">Close to Home -- The Tammy Bocommino Story</title> (1992), and <title render="italic">The Last Hit: Children and Violence</title> (1997). HKO Media productions received some of the highest awards in broadcasting, including a National Emmy and a George Foster Peabody Award fo r <title render="italic">Close to Home -- The Tammy Bocommino Story</title>, and an Alfred I. DuPont-Columbia University Award for <title render="italic">The Last Hit: Children and Violence.</title> </p>
      <p>During the economic recession of 2006 in Michigan, Ovshinsky transformed HKO Media from a production company into a creative consulting service. As a creative consultant, Ovshinsky received a commission from Family Communications Inc. to create a PBS children's series to replace <title render="italic">Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood</title>, which resulted Ovshinsky's work on <title render="italic">The Mighty Hubble</title>. Ovshinsky closed HKO Media in 2012. </p>

      <p> The collection is divided into four series: Personal files, Professional files, Project files, and Audiovisual materials. </p>
    </arrangement>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The collection traces Harvey Ovshinsky's personal and professional development as a writer, journalist, news broadcaster, radio host, television producer, creative consultant, and teacher. The Personal files include autobiographical writings providing insights into the events in Ovshinsky's childhood and adolescence that led to his early interest in writing and journalism. The Professional files contain the first issues of <title render="italic">The Fifth Estate,</title> and extensive memorabilia and press coverage on various radio stations and video and television production companies where Ovshinsky was employed. This series encompasses material on the history of Detroit's counterculture in the 1960s and 1970s. The Project files also include topical files on Detroit culture and history, which inspired many of Ovshinsky's documentaries and creative writing. </p>
      <p>Materials from Ovshinsky's teaching career and transcripts from his speaking engagements in the Professional files reveal his approach to teaching writing, while drafts for films, stories, and television series in the Project files offer a view into Ovshinsky's creative process. Files named "War Dances" appear throughout both the Professional files and the Project files series. "War Dances" were an integral part of Ovshinsky's approach to both problem solving and the creative process. "War Dances" were personal notes and reflections in which Ovshinsky assessed his present situation, identified his goals and imagined paths to the solution of a problem or to the final stages of a project. Materials from the subseries Educational and children's properties in the Project files include extensive topical files from Ovshinsky's research on how children learn through play. Samples of Ovshinsky's work in radio, television, educational programming and public speaking are available in Audiovisual materials.</p>

          <p>The Professional files series (3 linear feet, 1965-2012) contains print materials that trace the developments of Ovshinsky's career in journalism, communications media, and teaching. The series is divided into six subseries: Underground journalism and <title render="italic">The Fifth Estate</title>; Civilian service as conscientious objector; Radio print materials and memorabilia; Video and television production print materials and memorabilia, Teaching; and Speaking engagements, presentations, and workshops. The series is comprised of press articles, photographs, professional correspondence, project files, and Ovshinsky's writings, notes, and personal reflections. The Underground journalism and <title render="italic">The Fifth Estate</title> subseries contains correspondence, personal memoirs, and writing on Detroit's counterculture in the late sixties through the early seventies. This subseries also includes the earliest issues of <title render="italic">The Fifth Estate.</title> The Civilian service as conscientious objector subseries focuses on the founding of <title render="italic">Open City,</title> a clinical self-help center providing social, medical and legal support to Detroit's youth. <title render="italic"/> The Radio print materials and memorabilia subseries consists of scripts, photographs, and press articles. The Video and television production print materials and memorabilia subseries contains photographs, press articles, correspondence, and an extensive collection of records from Ovshinsky's own production and consulting company, HKO Media. The Teaching subseries is comprised of student evaluations, course materials, correspondence, and Ovshinsky's reflections on teaching writing.

          <p>The Project files series (5.1 linear feet, 1983-2011) is divided into three subseries: Screenplays, Educational and children's properties, and Miscellaneous unproduced projects and properties. This series encompasses extensive collections of drafts, notes, topical and research files, and correspondence, providing a glimpse into Ovshinsky's personal creative process as well as the production process. The Screenplays subseries includes drafts, correspondence, interviews, feedback, topical files, Writers' Guild registrations, and legal materials. The Educational and children's properties subseries contains topical files on child psychology, proposals, correspondence, creative notes and production materials relating to Ovshinsky's three major projects for children: Pendragon's Park, Please Don't Eat the Books, and The Mighty Hubble. Miscellaneous unproduced projects and properties include summaries of story concepts, drafts, and topical files.</p>
