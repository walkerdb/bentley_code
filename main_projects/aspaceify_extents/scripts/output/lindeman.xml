      <p>Joyce Lindeman is best known as an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Michigan and nationally recognized synchronized swimming coach and advocate. She received her B. S. in 1954 from Eastern Michigan University. From 1954 to 1965 she taught and coached synchronized swimming at Lee M. Thurston High School. After eleven years at Thurston, Lindeman returned to school to pursue an</p>
      <p>M. S. degree at the University of Michigan. After completing her degree in 1966, Lindeman became an Assistant Professor at Western Michigan University.</p>
      <p>In 1967 Lindeman returned to the University of Michigan as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physical Education, then administratively housed within the School of Education. Her career at the University included a distinguished record of teaching and service. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1973, and served as chairperson of the Department of Sports Management and Communication from 1989 to 2000. She also served as Associate Director of Curriculum and Instruction for the Division of Kinesiology from 1991 to 2000. In 1990 she was recognized by the State of Michigan's Teaching Excellence Fund and the University of Michigan for outstanding teaching.</p>
      <p>In addition to her academic and administrative positions, Lindeman also coached the University of Michigan Synchronized Swimming team from 1972 to 1983. The Synchronized Swimming program was started at the University of Michigan in 1955 with the establishment of the Michifish Swim Club. The men and women of Michifish presented a yearly performance and participated in various competitions held throughout the nation.</p>
      <p>Lindeman became the team's coach in 1972, and, in 1974, women's synchronized swimming was given varsity status, necessitating a split of the women's varsity team and the Michifish. Throughout the end of the 1970s, the women's varsity synchronized swimming team excelled, attracting top-notch swimmers such as Broderick Award winner Ruth Pickett. The team was well on its way to unseating number one Ohio State University as the reigning synchronized swimming team in the United States. Unfortunately, in 1982, synchronized swimming suddenly lost varsity status.</p>
      <p>In 1982, the University of Michigan decided to participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) championships for women. Because the NCAA did not recognize synchronized swimming as a competitive sport, the University of Michigan revoked the synchronized swimming team's varsity status. Previously, the University sponsored championships through the National Association for Girls and Women's Sports (NAGWS). Despite petitions, a letter writing campaign, the inclusion of synchronized swimming as an Olympic sport, and compelling arguments by coaches and officials, the team was relabeled a club sport for the 1983-1984 season. Although the University followed through on scholarships that had already been awarded, it no longer provided the additional scholarships necessary for recruiting nor funding for expenses such as a coach's salary, equipment, and travel. Michifish continues to exist on campus as a club sport and presents a yearly watershow.</p>
      <p>In addition to her work at the University of Michigan, Lindeman was active in many synchronized swimming organizations such as United States Synchronized Swimming Incorporated (USSSI), the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance, the National Synchronized Swimming Coaches Academy, the National Institute for Creative Aquatics, and the National Association for Girls and Women in Sport, as well as participating as a judge at synchronized swimming competitions. From 1984 to 1997, Lindeman served as vice president for Olympic international, administration, and education of USSSI. Her USSSI activities also included helping to develop a national training and certification program for synchronized swimming coaches. During this period she also coached and managed several national team tours to Europe and the Pan American Games, as well as the 1989 Olympic Festival and the 1990 Goodwill Games.</p>

      <p>The Joyce Lindeman papers are divided into five series: Michifish, Topical Files, Varsity Teams, Department of Physical Education, United States Synchronized Swimming Incorporated, Photographs and Slides, and Motion Pictures. The contents chronicle the synchronized swimming team's promising rise from club to varsity status, and then the team's unexpected return to club status. The materials also document her work as a professor at the University of Michigan and her involvement in synchronized swimming at the national level.</p>

          <p>Papers unrelated to a specific team or event can be found alphabetically arranged in the Topical Files series. Most of the materials dealing with synchronized swimming associations, fundraising, and administrative duties are collected in this series, however, some additional information may also be housed in the Varsity Teams series. In addition, correspondence documenting the controversial change from varsity to club status is located in the correspondence folder labeled "Varsity to Club Change."</p>

          <p>Organized chronologically, the Varsity Teams series documents the activities of synchronized swimming team after it gained varsity status in 1974. Several years also include year-end reports that summarize each year's activities. Researchers desiring more detail can browse through many folders that give individual as well as team scores for each of the various competitions. Information concerning the budget, selection processes, and preparation for events hosted on the University of Michigan campus can also be found in this series.</p>

          <p>Motion pictures of several competitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s also give an idea of the skill level of the University of Michigan swimmers. In a more recent film, award winner Ruth Pickett is shown in <title render="italic">Figures for Degree of Difficulty Project</title> which was produced in 1981. These motion pictures are in various formats which include Super 8 film, 8 mm film, and video tape. Included in this series are <title render="italic">Don Canham's Champions on Film</title> which are synchronized swimming training tapes produced on continuous running cartridges. It appears that University of Michigan synchronized swimming team members may have participated in the production of these tapes.</p>
