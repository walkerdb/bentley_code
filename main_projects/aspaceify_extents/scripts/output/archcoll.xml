      <abstract>The A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning (TCAUP) was established (as the College of Architecture) in 1931. However, courses in architecture have been offered at the University of Michigan since 1876, and a department of architecture, formed in 1913, preceded the creation of the college. Since its formation, TCAUP has offered courses and programs in several areas, including landscape architecture, urban planning, urban design, real estate, and, of course, architecture. The record group includes dean's administrative files and correspondence, other administrator files, meeting minutes, department and program files, materials from the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), lectures and other documentation on the Raoul Wallenberg lecture hosted by the college, and several photographs and negatives of the college and TCAUP-related events.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The Act of 1837, which established a state university at Ann Arbor, numbered among its provisions one for the appointment of a professor of civil engineering and architecture. However, it was not until 1876 that William LeBaron Jenney was appointed as the first professor of architecture and design. In that year, one-third of the legislature's appropriation for the School of Mines was set aside for the establishment of a Department of Architecture and Design. In its first year, the program attracted seven students, and appeared to be off to a good start. Unfortunately, the initial two-year appropriation was not renewed and Jenney's classes were not held after 1877.</p>
      <p>During the next twenty years, much interest was expressed, both within and outside the university, in resuming an architectural studies program. Finally, in 1905, the Board of Regents approved the establishment of a chair of architecture within the Department of Engineering, and in 1906 Emil Lorch was appointed professor of architecture. Even in its earliest years, it was the strong desire of the unit to establish a separate Department of Architecture rather than remain a subdepartment of the Department of Engineering. A first step toward the achievement of this goal was made in 1913, when the unit was granted administrative control over itself. In 1915, the separate but related status of the Departments of Architecture and Engineering was formalized, with the establishment of the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture composed of those two departments. In 1931, a separate College of Architecture was set up as an autonomous unit of the university. Emil Lorch was named Director of the College. He continued in this position until his retirement in 1936. In 1937, Wells Ira Bennett assumed the directorship; his title was changed in 1938 to Dean of the College. He served in this capacity until 1957.</p>
      <p>The focus of the architectural program expanded throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. A degree program in decorative design became a component of the department, and began to attract students more interested in art and design than architecture. Landscape design, a department established in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts in 1909, was transferred in 1939 to the College of Architecture, becoming the Department of Landscape Architecture. In recognition of these additional components, the unit's name was changed in 1939 to the College of Architecture and Design. In 1946, a major in city planning began to be offered by the college. The art and design courses continued to attract students from outside the formal program. An administrative reorganization in 1954-55 formally divided the college into three departments: the Departments of Art, Architecture, and Landscape Architecture. In 1957, Philip Youtz became dean, serving until 1964, when Reginald Malcolmson assumed the office. Changes in departmental organization continued to reflect changes in the emphasis of the program. In 1964, the Department of Landscape Architecture was transferred to the School of Natural Resources, while in 1968, a Department of Urban Planning was added.</p>
      <p>The emphasis of the architectural program changed within the university over time, as is reflected in the various organizational schemes. More broadly, so did conceptions of appropriate professional education of architects. This is reflected in the changing requirements of the College of Architecture. In 1922, the Regents endorsed a fifth year of study for architectural students, which over time became the norm. In the 1950s, recognition of the importance of a sixth year of study grew slowly as an increasing emphasis was placed by the discipline on professionalism. A six-year master's program was formally implemented in 1967. In 1969, Michigan became the first College of Architecture to offer a two-year graduate degree (D. Arch.) beyond the master's program.</p>
      <p>In many respects, 1974 proved to be a pivotal year for the College of Architecture and Design. Following a recommendation of the "Report of the College of Architecture and Design Review Committee" (April 11, 1974), the so-called "Norman Report," the Departments of Architecture and Urban Planning maintained their association in a new College of Architecture and Urban Planning while an administratively separate School of Art was formed. In that same year, the college moved to new headquarters on North Campus. There, the college and the School of Art continued to share facilities in the new Art and Architecture Building. Also in 1974, the faculty began two extensive studies of the college for the purposes of accreditation, and a new dean was appointed - Robert C. Metcalf. Metcalf was a graduate of the college and had been a member of the architecture faculty since 1955. He later served as chairman of the Department of Architecture (1968-1974). His tenure as Dean of the College lasted from 1974 to 1986. He continued to practice architecture in Ann Arbor, specializing in residential construction, both during and after his term as dean.</p>
      <p>The period from 1972 to 1976 was especially fertile for the College of Architecture and Urban Planning in terms of re-thinking fundamental questions about the nature of architecture and about how a program in architectural education should be structured. By the 1970s, the practice of architecture and architectural problems were becoming more broadly defined. As the Norman Report noted, the architecture profession, as a whole, was moving away from a "master builder role to a role which considers all the problems inherent in providing physical facilities for human occupancy." Architecture was now viewed in a wider context as "environmental design" or "the built environment."</p>
      <p>Aware of these changes, the university tried to work out an organizational framework to integrate the efforts of architects with others working on environmental problems throughout the university. Beginning as early as the 1960s, various centers, schools, councils and institutes were proposed. These units would have linked or merged programs in the College of Architecture and Urban Planning with those in the School of Natural Resources and to a lesser extent with programs in other units. Although the Institute for Environmental Quality was born out of these efforts in 1971, no significant reorganization of academic units had resulted. Since a restructuring of the college was already underway in 1974, the time seemed right to try again. As the Norman Report noted, "We therefore identify as a complex problem, disturbing to many of its faculty, a feeling that they should be operating within a wider context and perhaps in some new organizational unit having broad environmental goals." Had the recommendations of the Norman Report been fully implemented the college would have undergone an even more significant reorganization. However, by 1976, the idea of a new "umbrella" College of Environmental Resources, Planning and Design had been rejected.</p>
      <p>Following 1976, the College of Architecture and Urban Planning redirected its efforts away from further reorganization towards developing joint ventures and dual-degree programs with other units. A number of such programs were explored and several implemented despite complications over scheduling, administration, and joint-appointments. For example, in landscape architecture, students could take coursework in the architecture program as well as in the School of Natural Resources. Other arrangements were worked out with the School of Art, the School of Business Administration and other units.</p>
      <p>During Dean Metcalf's tenure, enrollment more than doubled both in the six-year master's program in architecture and in the doctoral program in architecture. In terms of educational philosophy, the college renewed an emphasis on training students to meet the everyday challenges faced by practicing architects. The college stressed a practical problem-solving approach to architectural education. This approach influenced curriculum. As Dean Metcalf noted in 1979, "the best design problems are 'real world' problems, with real clients, real sites and real constraints. In the past several years, real problems have become the standard design fare at the master's level, and are often used in undergraduate design classes."</p>
      <p>The college also recognized the need for more on-the-job training for future architects. For some students, the various intern programs with established architectural firms met that need. Others chose community projects. These projects provided practical working experience for students as well as design assistance for local communities. One of the most successful projects was Project GROW (Grass Roots Organization of Workers) which was started in 1965 by Professor James Chaffers of the College of Architecture and Design (then a graduate student in the college) and Mrs. Wayona Howard (a community organizer) on the near-west side of Detroit. By 1980, it had become one of the oldest and longest running community design centers in the country. Design assistance was also given to the North Central Property Owners Association in Ann Arbor as well as to a number of other non-profit community organizations.</p>
      <p>Instruction in urban planning also evolved during the Metcalf years. Enrollment in the urban planning program grew considerably during the 1970s although it remained the smaller unit within the college. In 1978, the curriculum in urban planning underwent major changes. These included more stringent requirements in statistics, economics, and analytic methods as well as the development of a series of concentrations. It was felt that these changes might better meet the needs of students entering the program with a wide variety of interests and diverse undergraduate backgrounds.</p>
      <p>In terms of architectural research, the college continued to build on an already well-established reputation. The Architecture Research Laboratory, established in 1949, was one of the first such institutions in the country. Prior to 1974, the laboratory "contributed to the development of new structural concepts, new approaches to housing in developing countries, new information on behavioral responses to the physical environment, new methods and tools for the analysis and assessment of problems, and new criteria for the planning of specialized facilities." After 1974, the lab became more interested in new building technology, especially in regard to energy conservation, and in computer-aided design. Housing for the elderly and hospital room design (especially for the University of Michigan Replacement Hospital) were other areas of research in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>During the 1970s, questions about the legal and professional responsibilities of architects arose and the college faculty (especially Dean Metcalf) were actively involved in resolving them. In 1977, the Department of Licensing and Regulation of the State of Michigan established a sub-committee on sunset legislation designed to dissolve those state licensing boards, which were viewed as simply protecting the vested interests of those licensed. However, Dean Metcalf argued successfully that public interest in safe, efficient, and harmonious buildings necessitated continued state licensing. The profession, with major input from the college, reworked and finally adopted a fixed combination of education, working experience, and examination to certify architects in Michigan. The heart of the certification system was the registration exam - a 30-hour, 3-day exam held regularly by the State of Michigan. The college set up design examination workshops to prepare students to take what one member of the Michigan Society of Architects referred to as, "that horrendous State Board 'test' of everything you are and hope to be." It was hoped that the certification system would eventually make it more difficult for non-registered architects to work on significant projects.</p>
      <p>From 1987 to 1998, Robert M. Beckley provided leadership as dean to the college. By 1989, under his tenure, a sociotechnical focus had been added to the doctoral program in urban and regional planning, which became the Ph.D. Program in Urban, Technological, and Environmental Planning (UTEP). The Doctoral Program in Architecture was also modified in 1989, and the degree designation changed to a Ph.D., giving the college a comprehensive program of professional and doctoral education in both architecture and urban planning. In 1992, the two individual programs in urban planning and UTEP were merged to form the Urban and Regional Planning Program (URP). Beckley also invested time and energy promoting the college nationally and internationally, maintaining contact with and inviting notable architects and designers from around the world to the Ann Arbor campus. The attention he devoted to alumni matters was equally significant, perhaps most movingly demonstrated in October of 1995, when a sculpture was dedicated at the entrance of the school in honor of distinguished alumnus Raoul Wallenberg -- a memorial to Wallenberg's friend and classmate Sol King by King's family.</p>
      <p>In 1998, Douglas S. Kelbaugh assumed the deanship with an expressed orientation toward bridging architecture and urban planning in the college, on the campus, in the community, and across the state. Newest to the curriculum (2000-01 academic year) is the Urban Design program, which will train urban designers to combine the skills, methods, and values of architect, urban planner, and landscape architect. The program is designed to take advantage of the college's present engagement with the larger public, especially with the city of Detroit.</p>
      <p>In 1999, the name of the school was changed to A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning in honor of long-time University of Michigan benefactor, Alfred Taubman. Taubman's $30 million gift to the school in that same year was one of the largest in university history and the most generous single gift ever made to a school of architecture in the United States. According to Dean Kelbaugh, the endowment gift will provide the ongoing funding needed to transform the college. New scholarships will improve an ability to compete nationally for top applicants. The strength of the faculty will be built through multiple new appointments. The gift is also earmarked for launching new initiatives in urban planning and community work.</p>

      <p>The A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture + Urban Planning records document the teaching of architecture and design at the University of Michigan beginning in 1878. The records include administrative files, correspondence committee minutes, reports, photographs and architectural drawings. The records have been received in a number of separate accessions which may include material that continues or complements record series from a previous accession or may overlap chronologically with previous accessions. This finding aid reflects the intellectual structure of the records by bringing like material together across accessions. As a consequence, in the container listing box numbers will not necessarily be in consecutive order.</p>
      <p>The records are organized in fifteen principal series:

          <p>The Dean's Administrative Files series consists largely of subject files maintained by the dean's office and include documentation relating to the administration of the college as well as professional and sometimes personal activities of the deans. The series is organized in subseries corresponding to the tenure of individual deans, although a subseries may include material dating from a previous dean's tenure.</p>

              <p>Administrative Files, 1956-1974, of Dean Reginald Malcolmson are arranged alphabetically and include correspondence, memos, reports, position papers, and notes. The files date between 1956 and 1974 and include a few materials from the previous dean, Philip Youtz. However, the bulk of the files date between 1964 and 1974. Malcolmson's deanship (1964-1974) coincided with the period in which the college was preparing for a move to new facilities on the North Campus. The files document Malcolmson's administrative concerns with the move as well as his personal interest in the planning process. The files also contain material concerning the reorganization of the college and the relationship between the Art and Architecture departments. The series also includes a fair amount of material relating to Malcolmson's personal scholarly and professional activities; for example, materials concerning Malcolmson's Fulbright lectures in South America, and his ongoing relationship with various South American architects. In addition to the administrative files of the various deans contained in this collection the researcher should be aware that the Bentley Library also holds the personal collections of Director Emil Lorch and Deans Bennett and Youtz.</p>

              <p>The 1959-1974 Administrative Files of Dean Malcolmson (1.5 linear feet) are especially rich regarding the planning, construction, and move to the North Campus facilities. In addition, the personal files of Professors Edward Olencki and Walter Sanders supplement earlier accession materials relating to the college during the 1950s and early 1960s.</p>

              <p>The Administrative Files, 1964-1986 of Dean Metcalf (6.5 linear feet, received in the 1989-89 accession) cover a diverse range of topics. While the vast majority of the material dates from Metcalf's deanship, a few folders date from earlier periods when Metcalf was a faculty member or chairman of the Department of Architecture. In general, the administrative files relate to the internal organization of the College of Architecture and Urban Planning and to Dean Metcalf's participation in various professional organizations. Very little information exists here on Metcalf's private practice as an architect. The researcher should also note that post-1974 executive committee meeting minutes and faculty meeting minutes were not included in this accession.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the best overviews of the college during the Metcalf years can be gleaned from the "College of Architecture and Design Review Committee Report" (April 11, 1974), the so-called Norman Report, and from subsequent accreditation plans and reports. Since the reorganization of the college, the move to North Campus, and the search for a new dean were all happening simultaneously in 1974, file folder titles indicating one of these subjects may contain some information on all three events.</p>
              <p>For information on actual and proposed organizational changes in the college around 1974, the researcher should consult the Norman Report and "Environmental Programs - University of Michigan." Attempts to find a university-wide organizational scheme, which would consolidate environmental programs, led to new proposals after 1974 for a further restructuring of the college (see Administrative History). Although the College of Environmental Resources, Planning and Design never materialized it was seriously considered. As a consequence, thoughtful discussions on the overall direction of the architectural profession took place at that time and are documented in these files. The lengthy debates regarding reorganization of the college also led to a delay in the selection of a new dean which is documented in the "Dean, Search Committee" files. For those interested in interdisciplinary programs, which emerged especially after 1976, "Joint Ventures and Dual-Degree Programs" should be consulted.</p>
              <p>The researcher who is interested in architectural education during the Metcalf era should study those files found under the heading, "Students: Education and Related Activities." Although there is no useful summary of curriculum changes for the period, the Educational Program Committee (E.P.C.) files contain correspondence on the merits of new course offerings and note yearly changes in the education program. Information on student internships can be found in the Intern Programs files. Material on Project GROW and the North Central Property Owners Association can be found among the Projects and Community Service files. "Minority Enrollment" files (separate topical heading) document efforts of the college to attract and hold minority students. Correspondence regarding faculty informational visits to Detroit public schools, meetings with black alumni, and annual statistical reports are included here.</p>
              <p>The Annual Files under the heading "Research Activities" record the expanding volume and scope of research at the college during the 1974-1986 period. Architectural research projects predominate in these files, but scattered urban planning research projects are also included, especially during the 1980s. Perhaps the best general surveys of architectural research at the college can be obtained from the "Research Program Review, 1979" and from the reports, "Development Needs of the Architecture and Planning Research Laboratory" (November 1982) and "Functional and Space Needs of the Architecture and Planning Research Laboratory" (May 1983). While several projects undertaken by the Architecture and Planning Laboratory are documented under the heading "Research Activities," folders under "Energy Efficiency Programs" should also be consulted to study lab projects.</p>
              <p>Information on certification for architects can be found under "Michigan Board of Registration for Architects." Dean Metcalf was a prominent member of the Board of Registration and actively involved in examination procedures and licensing requirements. His views on these subjects can be found in his correspondence as a board member and as a member of the Sunset Legislation Committee. His remarks to the "Michigan Society of Architects Panel on Registration" in 1977 also address the issue of certification</p>

              <p>Although the majority of the 1967-1988 files (received in the 1993 accession) date from the deanship of Robert C. Metcalf, there are also materials from the tenure of Dean Reginald F. Malcomson (1964-1974). The file is arranged alphabetically by topic, and documents activities, goals and objectives, research, and faculty life of the college, particularly relating to Architecture. Informative background is provided in the essay "History of Architecture and Design, 1952-1974." The essay was later edited by Ferol Brinkman and published in the <title render="italic">University of Michigan, An Encyclopedic Survey</title>, Volume V (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1977).</p>
              <p>Activities occurring within the college are best documented in the "Annual Report Files" and the "Letter From the Dean" file found under the heading "Alumni." The "Annual Report Files" include drafts of yearly reports to the university president, in addition to background materials collected for preparation of the report. Background materials consist of news releases (announcing guest speakers, award recipients and special events), inter-office memos and clippings. The "Letter From the Dean" is an annual letter sent to the alumni highlighting major events and activities, memorial funds, financial gifts, and enrollment figures. There is not a complete run of these letters. The "Vice President for Academic Affairs Correspondence," which is primarily outgoing, provides information on budgets, academic and appointment policies, faculty listings and program development.</p>
              <p>Strategic plans of action, and statements of goals and objectives can be found under "Annual Report Files," "Educational Development Plan," and "Futures." The latter is found under the heading "Committees." Research conducted in the college is documented under several different headings: "Architecture Research Laboratory/Architecture &amp; Planning Research Laboratory," "Research," "Student Research Review," and "Funding Proposals." Files under these headings contain student and faculty research proposals and funded project listings that include sponsorship and funding amount. The researcher should also inspect the contents of the "Center for Architecture and Planning Studies" folder. There is information on the unsuccessful attempt to establish a research center that would have served as an advanced educational and consultative organization. The center would have combined research activities at the university with professional services of non-university architects to solve problems dealing with environmental planning and design. The researcher interested in faculty members of the college will find the "Promotions" files especially illuminating. For every Board of Regents approved faculty promotion, there is a profile containing academic and professional experience, publications, academic degrees and university appointments.</p>

              <p>The Metcalf, 1969-1994 files will be particularly valued for the collection of speeches and presentations, which run from 1969 to 1994. Research files are equally illuminating when considering directions undertaken during Metcalf's leadership.</p>

            <p>Dean Robert Beckley's administrative files are particularly rich for documentation of his interest in campus planning, captured, for example, in 1989 transcripts and audiotapes of the A. Alfred Taubman Symposium on Campus Planning. The forum, charged with addressing pressing issues facing campus growth, engaged participants in thinking creatively about development needs. Files also include material from a lecture and panel discussion on the future of design education that marked the Beckley inauguration, a solid run of his speeches and presentations from 1988 to 1993, and a collection of cards and letters he received upon retirement.</p>

            <p>The Kelbaugh subseries of the Dean's Administrative Files, 1993-2008 (bulk 1998-2008) (3 linear feet and 1 oversize box) continues the series from previous accessions. The records in this series primarily originate from Douglas S. Kelbaugh's tenure as dean, but also include files from Dean Robert M. Beckley, and Interim Dean James Snyder's tenures. Included in the series are files on each of the annual charrettes hosted by TCAUP from 1999 to 2008. The charrettes, which are collaborative design planning sessions, were initiated by Dean Kelbaugh as an effort on the part of the University and TCAUP to help revitalize Detroit. Each year the charrettes focused on a different section of Detroit. The charrettes were held at the UM Detroit Center, which is also well-documented in this series. In addition to hosting the charrettes TCAUP is also involved in other programs at the Detroit Center, and, along with the 17 other units on campus, contributes to the funding of the center.</p>
            <p>Another interesting topic covered in the files is the re-location of the Lorch Column. Originally located in the courtyard of Lorch Hall (the original home of the College of Architecture), the column was moved to the front of the Art and Architecture Building on North Campus. The column was restored to its original height using a steel insert, and renamed the Lorch Column in honor of Emil Lorch, founder of the College of Architecture. The dedication of the column in October 2007 consummated the College's centennial, celebrated in 2006. It may also be of interest to note that initially the column was to be re-located along with an entry portal that also stood near Lorch Hall on Central Campus. However, the entry portal was left standing in the lawn just southwest of Lorch Hall. The files included proposals to move both the column and the portal, along with enhanced photographs of proposed sites for the two sculptures. (See also oversize materials relating to the relocation of the column in Box 59).</p>
            <p>The files also contain information on A. Alfred Taubman's involvement with and interest in the College of Architecture. A file titled "Taubman Building Project" contains documentation on an attempt to expand and renovate the Art and Architecture Building. This project was to be funded with assistance from Taubman, but prohibitive costs prevented the renovation from moving forward (for further documentation on the renovation project refer to another series in this accession: Art and Architecture Building Renovation). However, Taubman remained in contact with the college, and shortly after the building project fell through, discussion began around the possibility of establishing an endowment for the school. The "Taubman Proposal" file includes correspondence and drafts of proposals regarding the $30 million gift from Taubman to establish the endowment. Following the donation, the College of Architecture and Urban Planning was renamed in Taubman's honor.</p>

          <p>The National Architectural Accrediting Board series includes reports or portions of reports for 1955 to 1961, 1965-1966, 1970-1971, 1976, 1981 1987, 1988, 1993, and 1998, along with correspondence and other related material for 1981-1982 and 1986-1989. Much can be gleaned from these records, since the National Architectural Accrediting Board requires a self-assessment statement and description of its programs, followed by a site visit and an evaluation report. This is substantial documentation, from organization, governance, programming and recruitment of staff to physical facilities and public service. Appendices to reports include faculty profiles, course descriptions, and statistical data.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Raoul G. Wallenberg series holds some biographical material on Wallenberg, a 1935 graduate of the College of Architecture; files on six Wallenberg lectures, including administrative correspondence, publicity and biographies of the various speakers; general correspondence relating to Wallenberg and to the lecture as a whole; materials on the financial status of the Wallenberg Fund; publicity on Raoul Wallenberg; and a folder of miscellaneous material. One bound copy of the first lecture and an unbound copy of the second lecture have been removed and placed in the printed collection.</p>
          <p>A later accession of Wallenberg related material includes several photographs of Wallenberg with friends during his student days at Michigan and an image of the house he lived in while in attendance. Also included is an April 25, 1997 commemorative stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service, a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) produced video entitled, "Man Alive: Missing Hero," and a transcript of Senator Carl Levin's 1981 Wallenberg Lecture. Wallenberg related material is scattered throughout the record group, however, and can be found in the files of deans in addition to the Wallenberg series in this and prior accessions.</p>
          <p>A 2010 accession of additional Wallenberg material (1 linear foot, box 69) covers the years 1972-1997. The bulk of the records consists of files on the University's Wallenberg Lecture, though there are also several files of general correspondence, and a file on the Wallenberg scholarship fund. The lecture files are arranged chronologically and date from the 1972/73 lecture delivered by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner to the 1996/97 lecture delivered by Michael Sorkin. These files include correspondence between the lecturers and the college, articles and clipping on the lectures, and some files include transcripts of the lectures.</p>

            <p>Dean Robert Metcalf's 1969-1996 correspondence consists largely of material pertaining to his participation in professional organizations or letters of recommendation and support for students and colleagues. One expandable folder, however, holds engaging correspondence with C. Theodore Larson, a highly regarded UM professor of architecture. When Larson died in 1988, Metcalf said, "I think he was a seminal figure, one of the most innovative people we have ever had at this university...I have a whole box full of his correspondence. He was always bombarding you with ideas." (See also C. Theodore Larson papers, 1930-1985 (bulk 1951-1974), Bentley Historical Library.)</p>

Included are letters and e-mails between the dean's office, and the faculty, staff, students, and alumni of the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. There are also some letters and e-mails with other faculty and administrators at the University of Michigan, as well as correspondence with faculty and administrators from other universities. Although there are some printed e-mails included in the collection, a more complete record of Dean Kelbaugh's e-mail correspondence may be found digitally.</p>

          <p>The Doctoral Program Files (1 linear foot) are arranged in topical order and cover the period 1969-1987. These files consist of program evaluations, student profiles, dissertation lists and program requirements. Of particular interest are the files of the "Doctoral Program Committee." These annual files include lists of students, their field of study and advisor, dissertation proposal/abstracts, some committee minutes, and seminar class information. Program requirements, goals, and objectives can be ascertained from the many evaluative reports found under the heading "Reports." In addition, the "Doctoral Program Council" folder also contains evaluative program materials. The researcher will also find goals and objectives, sources of student financial aid, and a proposal for the Doctor of Architecture program within the "Historical Materials" folder.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files, 1926-1993 enhance this record group's documentation of student activities. A several year span of entries for the George Booth Traveling Fellowship in Architecture includes many imaginative proposals by young alumni. The researcher will also find submissions for the first Saarinen-Swanson Essay Contest, held in 1989. Also included are the bylaws of the student chapter of American Institute of Architects (AIA), and information about visiting scholars and lecturers.</p>
            <p>The faculty records represented include materials collected for promotion review, and the confidential papers surrounding the promotion committee decision process. Although the latter records are restricted, the former are open to research.</p>
            <p>There are some administrative files as well, covering topics such as affirmative action, availability assessments and the raw data collected for the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) annual surveys. There are also some records for the Art and Architecture and Slide Libraries.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files, 1926-1991 (2.5 linear ft.) is comprised of material from a variety of sources. The nearly one foot of brochures representing a range of mainly Michigan architects, for example, was once a part of the Art and Architecture Library. Also generated from the library are photocopies of 1922-1923 correspondence between Emil Lorch and Frank Lloyd Wright, and photocopies of Eliel Saarinen related clippings and correspondence. In addition, the series brings together various papers and reports, including Emil Lorch's "Collections of the College, 1906-1936," a 1949 Mid-Century Report on Design Progress, and a 1988 strategic planning report. The series also holds further documentation of the Norman Committee in the form of correspondence, minutes, and membership lists. Other files include a medallion celebrating the 1972 groundbreaking for the North Campus building; commencement programs, 1980-1999; and a 1929 letter sent to President Ruthven by several alumni urging the separation of the College of Architecture from the College of Engineering.</p>

            <p>Professor William Werner, recipient of numerous professional awards, including more than one for teaching excellence, also served as Chairperson, Bachelor of Science Program from 1977 to 1983 and Assistant to the Architecture Program Chairperson from 1983 to 1992. Since Werner was primarily concerned with admissions, counseling and curriculum while fulfilling these roles, the files are a good source for information on the day-to-day administrative workings of the college. The records offer a window into nearly twenty years of the evolution of the architectural program at Michigan through syllabi, surveys, planning and orientation, and similar documents.</p>

            <p>The Development subseries includes resources on funds and fellowships, significant alumni, and fund raising projects. The subseries is organized in two alphabetical files, reflecting multiple accessions. A 1996 promotional CD-Rom created by Lee Liming highlights the college in an on-line tour of North Campus, presents staff in classroom settings, profiles students, and focuses on research current at the time. The Development subseries also includes a number of folders relating to the A. Alfred Taubman endowment that led to the school adopting its current name. While most of the material documents the event celebrating the receipt of the gift and the renaming, files also include strategic planning documents and the proposal created for Mr. Taubman outlining proposed uses for the endowment.</p>

            <p>The Personnel subseries includes promotion reviews, arranged chronologically from 1986 to 1994 and past faculty files, arranged alphabetically, along with several general personnel files. Past faculty records date from 1909 to 1989, although researchers should note that file folder dates do not necessarily represent the time period served. The folders sometimes include correspondence or clippings received or filed after a faculty member left the college. Content ranges widely, from a single page for a one-semester visiting professor, to a significant collection of documents for some long time staff. In the case of the latter, there is often correspondence, a photograph, vitae, sabbatical reports, and similar items.</p>

            <p>The Personnel, 1998-2008 subseries is divided into General Files, and Faculty and Staff Files. The General Files, 1997-2008 include college statistics, comparisons with other schools and colleges of architecture and urban planning, and salary charts. The Faculty and Staff Files, 1998-2008 are arranged alphabetically by faculty surnames and include correspondence, reports, and promotion and tenure reviews. Content within each folder varies, and researchers should note that the date range listed for the Faculty and Staff files is inclusive, but not all dates are represented in the individual files.</p>

          <p>The Architectural Drawings series captures in a wide range of drawing types, visions for the housing of the college in Ann Arbor from the mid-1940s to the very recent past. Carefully executed perspectives and elevations in pencil on tracing paper (signed RCG) represent a proposed 1946 addition for the Central Campus location of College of Architecture and Design. Eight undated blackline prints entitled "A Proposed Building by Associated Architects, The Department of Architecture Staff," positions the college on North Campus, but on a site that was not to be. Fifteen design development drawings in pencil and marker on vellum by Della Sala, Olencki, Sanders and Associates, 1955, also document an unbuilt North Campus project. (The North Campus building was eventually designed by Robert S. Swanson &amp; Associates and completed in 1974.) The most recent envisioned design for expansion and alteration of the current building is in a file entitled Program for Regeneration: University of Michigan Art and Architecture Building. In 1997, Enrique Norten and his firm TEN Arquitectos presented nine proposals to faculty, six were developed in more detail, and one selected by Alfred Taubman, benefactor of the project. The program for the regeneration project and related textual materials are in Box 45.</p>

            <p>The Photographs series include a wonderful group of images, many taken by Emil Lorch in 1926, documenting the construction of the Architecture and Design building that was named in his honor. There are also photographs of Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Dome. Fuller assembled the dome with the help of a design class in 1954. There is a set of very fine black and white photographs of faculty mounted on boards that were part of a 1968 exhibit entitled, "Faculty Exhibit Work." There is also a set of copy negatives produced from an equally fine set of undated faculty portraits. (The portraits were photographed because they could not safely be removed from large, heavy boards.) Also included in the series is a zip disk holding digital versions of images reproduced in Nancy Bartlett's history of the college, More Than a Handsome Box. An oversized box of photographs holds a striking Emil Lorch portrait; class of 1927 reunion snapshots; and several beautiful large photographs of Lorch Hall.</p>

            <p>The Photographs and Negatives series (7 linear feet) continues the series from previous accessions. The majority of the images date from 1987 to 2004, but there are earlier images dating from as far back as the 1920's/1930's to 1986. The series has been divided into six sub-series: Binders; Buildings and Other Structures; Events and Programs; People; Projects; and Publications. There is some overlap between sub-series.</p>
            <p>Included in this series are photos of exhibits, commencements, notable visitors to the college, alumni, buildings and structures designed by faculty and alumni, and images used to illustrate TCAUP publications. Of note are images of the Detroit Charettes held in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 (located in two sub-series: Binders, and Events and Programs), and from the naming ceremony held to celebrate the endowment from A. Alfred Taubman and the renaming of the college in his honor. Other significant images include a memento to Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome, the dedication of the Wallenberg memorial in front of the school, and a nice set of faculty photos from 1981 that include brief CV's attached to each portrait. Finally, the series provides a nice sampling of student work from classes, exhibits, and competitions.</p>
            <p>Researchers should note that the Binders sub-series is unique from the other sub-series in organization. The materials in this sub-series were originally housed in binders. Most of the binders contained a combination of photos from various events, projects, people, and structures that were housed together according to year, or month and year. There were also a number of binders containing images relating to a specific event, such as the charrettes of 2001 and 2002. The materials in each binder were kept together and re-housed in expandable folders. Therefore, the labels for these folders will be much broader than the folders labels used in the other sub-series, and researchers will find materials from multiple events and activities in these folders.</p>
            <p>Researchers should also note that some folders in the series included image identification forms containing descriptive information on the images included in that file. These forms were part of a project to describe the images before they were sent to the Bentley, and the information on some of these forms may not be accurate.</p>

          <p>The Art and Architecture Building Renovations series, 1996-1998 (0.5 linear feet) includes files documenting the beginning of a project to expand and modify the Art and Architecture Building. Enrique Norton and his firm TEN Arquitectos submitted several reports and proposals on the desired renovation. The project was halted due to prohibitive costs. This series includes the reports generated by the TEN Arquitectos, along with reports, correspondence, and other documentation from staff within the College. The proposals submitted by the TEN Arquitectos were included in the 1996-2000 accession as a part of the ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS series.</p>

          <p>The Department of Urban Planning series, 1967-1988 (2.5 linear feet) documents the founding and development of the department in the mid-sixties. A program in urban planning existed within the college since 1946, but growing interest in planning led to the establishment of the Department of Urban Planning in 1968. The series is split into two sub-series: General Files and Course Files. The General Files, 1967-1988 include materials on programs within the department, department correspondence and reports, and student statistics. Also included are Urban Planning Program Council meeting minutes from August 29, 1968 to December 17, 1983. Researchers should note that the Urban Planning Program Council Meeting Minutes were called Urban Planning Faculty Meeting Minutes until September 3, 1976. The Course Files, 1967-1986 contain information on the various courses offered through the Department of Urban Planning. The files include proposals for new courses, course syllabi, and course materials. The date range indicated for the Course Files sub-series is inclusive, but not all dates are represented in the individual files.</p>

          <p>The Audio-Visual Material series (1 linear foot) includes audio tapes, video tapes, DVD's, and a film reel. Of particular interest in this series is a DVD celebrating TCAUP's centennial in 2006, three video tapes containing the three parts of the 2004 "Michigan Debates on Urbanism," and a video focusing on Albert Kahn called "Architects We Knew." There is also a lecture on audio tape delivered by Peter Eisenman in 1991, and a video of a lecture on the North Campus Redux effort delivered by Doug Kelbaugh.</p>

          <p>The E-mail Correspondence series (1.8 GB; 22,438 files) contains messages from Dean Kelbaugh's sent-mail directory dating from November 18, 2003 to August 2, 2008. The messages were originally arranged in reverse chronological order, and this order was maintained upon transfer to the Bentley. Correspondence in the series includes discussion on North Campus planning issues, the addition to the Art and Architecture building, development of the design charrette program, planning for the establishment of a Detroit Center, and Ann Arbor city planning developments such as Lowertown. There are also a number of messages regarding faculty recruitment and retention. During processing of the series no messages were deleted or weeded, therefore several instances of routine correspondence are also included. The series is an excellent example of the discourse maintained by Kelbaugh with colleagues in the architecture and urban planning field, as well as his attentive communication with administrators, faculty, and staff at the University of Michigan. Given the sensitive nature of some of this material, access is restricted in accordance with University policies. Each message is a separate file.</p>
