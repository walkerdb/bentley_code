    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Linda Kay Tanner Strodtman was born on March 24, 1944 in Reno, Nevada. She earned a nursing diploma in 1965 from Hurley Hospital School of Nursing in Flint, Michigan. A B.S. in Nursing from Michigan State University followed in 1967 and a M.S. in Medical-Surgical Nursing from the University of Michigan in 1970.</p>
      <p>Strodtman began her teaching career in 1967 as an assistant instructor at Hurley. She was an assistant professor of nursing in the University of Michigan's School of Nursing from 1972 to 1974, and began over ten years of supervising nursing graduate students doing research and clinical practicums. Strodtman also was active during the 1970s as a guest lecturer for School of Public Health courses and at nursing conferences.</p>
      <p>Strodtman's addresses, as well as her research work, were generally on diabetes, her clinical specialty, specifically the education of diabetic patients. In 1970 she was appointed a Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) in Endocrinology and Metabolism at the University Hospitals; she was one the first three CNSs at the hospital. A CNS is "a Masters prepared practitioner who utilizes advanced knowledge, clinical competencies, and research in a specialized area of nursing practice."</p>
      <p>When the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (MDRTC) was established in 1977, Strodtman was appointed a CNS at the center's Diabetes Center Unit (DCU). The DCU was the principal training and demonstration program core facility--a model patient care unit, employed to implement new care procedures and give practical training to health care professionals. Strodtman was one of the original members of the MDRTC's Executive Committee, first chair of the DCU's Care Program and Development Group, and member of the DCU's Operating Committee, Health Professional Education Committee, and Research Coordinating Committee.</p>
      <p>In addition to her work with diabetic patients in the DCU, Strodtman was active in defining the roles of CNSs in general. She has written and spoken on nursing assessment procedures, primary care nursing, nursing research, and peer review. She served on several committees concerned with defining research guidelines for CNSs.</p>
      <p>Strodtman has been committed to documenting the history of nursing. In addition to gathering the papers that constitute the current collection, she has completed a Ph.D. in the history of nursing, is active in the University of Michigan Nursing History Society, and has overseen the creation of a collection of nursing equipment and uniforms.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The papers of Linda Strodtman relate primarily to her work with diabetic patients at the University of Michigan Hospitals and to her more general involvement with Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS) during the years, 1970-1985. There is scant material on Strodtman's personal life. There are few documents in the collection relating to her research and teaching duties.</p>
      <p>What the collection does document is Strodtman's work with diabetic patients, her involvement with the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (MDRTC) and Diabetes Center Unit (DCU), and her activities as a CNS. The arrangement of the papers represents a blend of Strodtman's original order and description and series ordered by the processors. While this hybrid arrangement seeks to highlight aspects of her career, the researcher should note that series divisions are not absolute; some materials in the CNS series may relate to the MDRTC and vice versa.</p>
      <p>The researcher is advised to be flexible and persistent in using the Strodtman collection; related materials are in separate and distinct areas of the collection. Furthermore, materials related to the MDRTC, the DCU, and nursing in general can be found in other collections held by the Bentley Library: The Diabetes Research and Training Center, School of Nursing, and Medical-Surgical Nursing Area collections all contain related materials.</p>
      <p>The papers are organized into fourteen series:
        <list><item>Correspondence, 1970-1985;</item><item>Self-Evaluations, Progress Data, and Logs, 1970-1983;</item><item>Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (MDRTC), 1976-1986;</item><item>Diabetes Center Unit (DCU), 1975-1983</item><item>University of Michigan Hospitals, Early Diabetes Program, 1970-1976;</item><item>University of Michigan Hospitals, Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS), 1971-1983;</item><item>University of Michigan Hospitals, Nursing Services, 1975-1979;</item><item>Professional Activities, 1973-1988</item><item>Photographs</item><item>Medical Nursing Area Meetings, 1979-1984</item><item>Diabetes Patient Education Program, DCU, 1973-1983;</item><item>Educational Service for Nursing (ESN) 1978-1985</item><item>School f Nursing and Nursing Services, U-M Hospitals, 1980-1992</item><item>Patient Log Book, 1972-1982</item></list>
      </p>
      <p>The papers were received in several accession and several series are subdivided into subseries reflecting multiple accessions.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence, 1970-1985 series is rather skimpy. Much of the correspondence consists of routine requests for data on the DCU program; these have been preserved since they contain information on diabetes programs at other hospitals. There are some memos on the organization of nursing services at the University of Michigan Hospitals. Overall this series indicates the range of Strodtman's activities, but provides little depth of ken.</p>

          <p>The Self-Evaluations, Progress Data, and Logs, 1970-1983 series contains both day-by-day logs of Strodtman's nursing of diabetic patients, and summaries of her nursing goals and performance over six month periods. These document provide an in-depth firsthand account of the evolving duties of a CNS, and may give some indication of how these duties, and the regimen of the hospital's diabetes program, evolved over a decade.</p>

            <p>The 1976-1983 subseries documents one of the first of five programs funded by a 1977 HEW grant to explore inter-disciplinary approaches to the study and treatment of digestive and metabolic diseases, specifically diabetes. Stefan S. Fajans, director of MDRTC, believed this approach was the most fruitful way to "apply more effectively to the patient" what has been and will be learned about the disease. The MDRTC established three core programs--Continuing Education and Outreach (CEDO), Training and Demonstration, and Research-- and eleven core facilities. This series includes Strodtman's report to Nursing Service on the MDRTC grant proposal, which discusses both the center and the role of nurses in it at some length. Also important are the Executive Committee materials (1977-1982) which include a 1977 critique of the proposal by HEW and a 1982 review by the NIH. The Educational Policy Committee materials document the center's efforts to monitor ongoing educational programs for health care providers. Materials on public outreach and education can be found in the Regional Advisory Committee files and in the newsletter.</p>

          <p>The Diabetes Center Unit (DCU), MDRTC, 1977-1983 series documents the activities of the DCU. This unit was created to implement model diabetic patient care, to serve as a laboratory for studies of diabetics, and to give health care professional on-the-job training in the latest diabetic care techniques. John C. Floyd was the center's first director; he also served as coordinator of the DCU's parent unit within MDRTC, the Training and Demonstration Program. Strodtman chaired the DCU's Operating Committee and served on the other committees represented in this series. The strengths of the DCU series are the Committee Minutes, the Progress Reports, and Standards of Care. The terse minutes of the Operating Committee provide an overview of the unit; the Research Coordinating Committee and the Health Professional Education Committee provide the fullest documentation of these crucial functions within the DCU. The Progress Reports, prepared by Fajans, outline unit objectives, five-year plans, and rigorous self-assessments. Materials in the Standard of Care folder, some of which was created by Strodtman, addresses the defining of optimal goals and procedures for patient care.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the central concern of the DCU was educating diabetic patients in self-care to promote proper control of the disease. The Diabetes Patient Education Program, DCU, 1975-1983 series documents this effort with knowledge tests, handouts, and patient memos. This series also contains materials on internal and external evaluations of the efficacy of patient education programs.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan Hospitals, Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS), 1971-1982 series documents the CNS program nearly from its 1970 inception; Strodtman was one of three original CNS appointees. The series contains two early (1971) progress reports on the program, a proposal to expand clinical nursing opportunities, and surveys of CNSs. The Management by Objective reports, semi-annual descriptions of how each nurse met her responsibilities, provide telling insights into the specific activities of CNSs.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan Hospitals, Nursing Services, 1975-1979 series documents the general nursing activities of Strodtman. Of special note are the materials of the Strodtman-chaired Research Review and Study Committee, which functioned to "facilitate the conduct of nursing research," to review research proposals, and to promote the "incorporation of research findings into clinical nursing practice, management, and education at University Hospital." Strodtman was also active on the Interdisciplinary Task Force, which examined the impact of cross-disciplinary approaches on the quality of care, and she was involved with the Nursing Care Crises of 1979 which raised questions concerning the proper relationship between the School of Nursing and the Hospitals' Nursing Services.</p>

          <p>The series, School of Nursing and Nursing Services, University of Michigan Hospitals, contains materials that Kathryn Fischer and Strodtman collected from various committees and offices in the 1980s and early 1990s. Because it was sometimes difficult to determine whether the School of Nursing or Nursing Services (or both) created the documents, and because the materials shed little light on either Fischer's or Strodtman's career, the records were kept together in one series. Records easily available in other Bentley Library collections (see those listed above) were eliminated; the remaining files comprise a convenient gathering of committee work relating to nursing in the decade.</p>
