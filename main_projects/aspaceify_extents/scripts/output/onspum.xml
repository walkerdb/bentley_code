    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The idea for the Office of New Students Programs (ONSP) was first proposed during the Fleming Administration by a task force concerned with how to revise the orientation program. The ONSP did not come into being until president James Duderstadt took office in 1988. President Duderstadt issued the Michigan Mandate in which he expressed a strong commitment to educating students about diversity. The Office of New Student Programs was responsible for teaching sessions on diversity during Summer Orientation. The students who conducted these sessions were called facilitators. The goal of the facilitators was to teach new students how to gain a greater understanding of prejudice and stereotyping and how they affect students' personal feelings. When this project first began ONSP contacted many other universities and sources such as the Anti-Defamation League to find out what materials they were using to teach about diversity. The ONSP learned that one of the means of education was through video. The ONSP continues to discuss diversity at orientation. The office currently maintains a web site where they answer general questions about the university and their office. The url for this site is &lt;www.umich.edu/~orient&gt;.</p>

      <p>The Office of New Students Programs records consist of files relating to new student orientation program largely concerning diversity training and selection and training of counselors. The records includes manuals, guides, and videotapes and are divided into four series, Administration/Organizational Files, Evaluations of the Diversity Program, Audio-Visual Material and Publications. The Administration/Organization Files, Evaluations of the Diversity Program and approximately half of the VHS tapes from the Audio-Visual Materials series were acquired by the library in 1997. The rest of the material was acquired in a separate accession in 2007.</p>

          <p>Administration/Organizational Files (1987-1996) is the first series. The diversity training manuals document the creation of the diversity programs that the office sponsored. They contain records which explain what the goals of the diversity programs would be, and what the university wanted the program to accomplish. The correspondence is mostly between the Office of New Student Programs and other offices at the University of Michigan, such as the Office of the President. The files also document the selection process for program facilitators, and job descriptions. The fourth manual, the most recent, represents how information in the ONSP was kept after 1989. The manual lists facilitators for that year and what activities and programs they would be in charge of. The file also contains general correspondence. Two other files contain evaluations of the diversity program from students that went through the program. All of the comments are anonymous. The series also contains the speech "Towards a Truly Multicultural University" by Frances R. Aparicio, associate professor of Romance Languages/ Latino Studies at the University of Michigan. The final folder in the series contains a speech and a transcript from the network news program <title render="italic">Frontline</title>. The episode is titled "Racism 101" and focuses part of the story on the University of Michigan. In addition to the transcript there is a video of this episode in box 2.</p>

          <p>The second series, Evaluations of the Diversity Program (1987-1996), contains various types of responses about the diversity program. These responses include those from the facilitators that taught the program and those from students and parents who went through the diversity program. The largest part of this series are the final reports from the student facilitators. At the end of the summer each of them wrote an overview on the summer programs and described their reactions to the whole experience. Other forms of evaluations include questionnaires, surveys and comments.</p>

          <p>The Evaluations of the Diversity Program (1987-1996) series contains various types of responses about the diversity program. These responses include those from the facilitators that taught the program and those from students and parents who went through the diversity program. The largest part of this series are the final reports from the student facilitators. At the end of the summer each of them wrote an overview on the summer programs and described their reactions to the whole experience. Other forms of evaluations include questionnaires, surveys and comments.</p>

          <p>The Audio-Visual Material (1950s-2005) is comprised of photographic prints, slides, DVDs, VHS videotapes and a 16 mm film reel. The bulk of the photographs document the training the ONSP orientation staff. The slides also show orientation staff training as well as miscellaneous images of the University of Michigan New Student Orientation and various images of student life. There are several videos in the series which were used as part of orientation programs, most notably a number of videos about diversity of campus. "Diversity 1988" is an earlier version of the video "Commitment to Diversity." "Diversity Administration Introduction, Panel 1988" is an amateur an video taken of a training session on diversity. "Diversity Panel 8/6" is an amateur video of a question and answer session between the facilitators and members of the faculty. The tape also gives a good explanation about the diversity program. "International Perspective: A Global Look at Cultural Diversity" interviews students that are studying abroad and they talk about their homelands. The "Michigan Mandate" is a copy of former president James Duderstadt speaking to new students and expressing his commitment to make the University more diverse. "Racism 101" is an edition of the network news program <title render="italic">Frontline</title>. The program focuses on racism on college campuses. Part of it deals specifically with the University of Michigan and some of the racial incidents that have occurred on the campus. "Talk to Us" is the name of an amateur video of an activity that was part of the orientation. An acting troop named "Talk to Us" acts out skits about diversity which encourage the audience to interact with the actors. "Team 1 1989" is another amateur video. It documents many of the activities that go on during orientation, included a walking tour and games. "University of Michigan, Commitment to Diversity" is a production video that interviewed many students from diverse backgrounds. The students shared some of their experiences involving diversity at the university. "University of Michigan Student Orientation Version three" contains interviews of students who share their experiences involving diversity.</p>
