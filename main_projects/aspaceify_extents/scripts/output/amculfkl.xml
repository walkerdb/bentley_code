      <p>The University of Michigan Program in American Culture offered an undergraduate survey course on American Folklore beginning in 2005. Professor Bruce Conforth began teaching the course. The course focused on the conventional beliefs, customs, traditions and rituals that shape culture as well as urban legends. Students in the survey course were taught fieldwork methodology and were assigned a folklore collection project. The collection projects required students to identify a folklore topic, conduct oral interviews and write a report and prepare transcripts of the interviews. The collection projects were then accessioned into the American Culture Folklore and Oral History Archives (originally housed in the Program in American Culture). In 2010 the archives of collected folklore was transferred to the Bentley Historical Library.</p>
      <p>The folklore collection projects focused on an aspect of American folklore, which could range from a variety of topics. Students were given a large degree of independence in choosing their topic. Some of the most popular topics included traditions involving food, popular jokes, significant cultural objects, and customs and traditions surrounding the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Interviewing informants comprised a large part of the project, as students had to interview at least one person (informant) as a source, although many students interviewed more than that. In many cases, the recording devices or tapes or discs containing the interviews were included along with the hardcopy reports. Transcripts of the interviews were also a part of the written report. Some students included photographs of the subject they were researching, and in rare cases the object itself is included in the collection.</p>
      <p>Requirements for what should be included in the collection report evolved over the years. More recent projects include informant release forms, autobiographical sketches written by the student, as well as brief biographies about each of the informants.</p>
      <p>Note: Not all informants authorized the use of their name in the interviews. Consult release forms regarding use of the interviewee's name.</p>

      <p>The American Culture Folklore and Oral History Archives consists of folklore collection reports prepared by undergraduate students in the American Folklore course offered by the University of Michigan Program in American Culture. Prior to the transfer to the Bentley Historical Library, the folklore reports were organized according to general topics by students in the course and placed in archival folders and boxes under the direction of the professor. That order has been retained. Very often the media and objects included in the report have remained. The collection is meant to directly serve students who may take the Survey of American Folklore class in the future, and indirectly to those who, years from now, may re-discover and research aspects of American folklore that were pertinent during present day.</p>
      <p>There is considerable overlap in subject matter between the categories of collecting topics. In the collection, folders for the first set of reports in a series are ordered according to their pre-assigned number (which can be found in the Administrative Files series) and not according to the last name of the student or title. For the second set, however, where no such number exists, the reports are ordered by surname of the student. In this finding aid, only the student's name and title of the report is listed. Further in the series names will appear to be in alphabetical order when the pre-assigned numbers were not continued.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Files series consists of one box, with the folders labeled according to the genres/categories of papers that were written. These files contain "Accession Forms" for the American Culture Folklore Archives, and were filled out by hand for each report in the collection. They contain an assigned accession number (one number per report), the genre and sub-genre categories the report files under, as well as any keywords, presumably student-assigned, that relate to the report. The form also has a checklist for each type of material that was submitted along with the report (a list of informants, discs, audio cassettes, etc.), which may or may not have remained with the collection. The second page of the accession form asks for certain metadata from the student, such as the page length for certain documents, the condition of the accession, location, and number of informants. The forms in this series correspond with the first accession of reports that came as part of this collection. Not all reports in the collection may have an accession form or be recorded in the administrative files.</p>
          <p>These files also contain the information on the <emph render="italic">release status</emph> for the collection reports. In some cases the collector and author of the reports has assigned some release limitations and in other cases the informants/interviewees have assigned release limitations (typically that their names not be used).</p>

          <p>The Customs series is a very broad one, covering topics from formal events and topics that only occur annually or as part of a ceremonial tradition (such as "Maize Rage" at basketball games, family traditions, types of parties, rites of passage, singing groups, sports cheers, etc.) and are not part of daily life. It is different from the Cultural Objects series in that they are not religious or a singular object, but usually a repeated event that can be experienced by many individuals. However, the themes in this series very commonly overlap with attributes from other series. The kind of content in this series covers the gamut of most other series in this collection.</p>

Many reports cover the history and preparation of certain types of regional food (Mexican, Jewish, Italian, Upper Peninsula of Michigan, eating habits in fraternities/sororities and athletes, etc.) Overall this category is very broad, and is one of the largest series in the collection.</p>

          <p>The Jokes series is one of the largest series in the collection. Instead of focusing on local customs, this series is more concerned with certain types of jokes that are present everywhere in American youth culture. Some examples included reports written on racial jokes, dirty/sexual jokes, Jewish jokes, "yo mama" jokes, and blonde jokes. There are multiple reports written on many of these topics.</p>

          <p>The Legends series highly overlaps with Folk Tales in terms of subject matter, which can be quite broad. Some examples cover topics such as local legends, urban legends, and legends about the Diag at the University of Michigan.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Superstitions is very similar to the Legends and Folk Tales series, since many of the reports cover topics with legend-like qualities, and are stories that are believed and shared by individuals but are not necessarily true fact. To differentiate between the series, Superstitions covers very general topics, such as superstitions about cheerleaders, ghosts, saying grace at meals, and pregnancy. Legends/Folk Tales cover more distinct and isolated events, and are not about general topics.</p>
