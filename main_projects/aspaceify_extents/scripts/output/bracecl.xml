      <abstract>C. Loring Brace, professor of Anthropology at the University of Michigan and Curator of Biological Anthropology at the University's Museum of Anthropology. Known for extensive field research on cranial and dental material of hominid remains all over the world, particularly in Asia, to study human evolution. He has done considerable research on how structural reduction can result from Probable Mutation Effect, as well as on the development and application of the 'race' concept.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545"><p>Charles Loring Brace IV was born in New Hampshire in 1930. As a young man he had already expressed interest in the study of human origins, reason for which he pursued an undergraduate degree in Geology at Williams College, which he obtained in 1952. The College lacked an anthropology program so Brace combined courses in geology, biology, and philosophy to fulfill his interests.</p><p>C. Loring Brace, as he is known, went on to Harvard for a Master's degree in anthropology. His studies there were interrupted when Earnest A. Hooton, his professor, passed away and Brace was drafted for military service in 1954. On his return from active duty, Brace went to Maine where he did research on physical and behavioral relations among dogs at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory. Once he returned to Harvard, a year later, he did further analysis and research on the same topic to complete what would be his thesis. He received his Master's degree in 1958 and would receive his Ph.D. in 1962 from the same institution. It was during his time in Harvard that Brace met his future wife Mary L. Crozier. "Mimi" worked at the Peabody Museum where he was also doing research. She would go on to do some research with him and illustrate his books.</p><p>During the course of his doctoral study, National Science Foundation and fellowship support allowed him to do field work in Abri Pataud, France, and research on museum collections in several European countries including Italy, Switzerland, Austria, France, Germany, and Great Britain. Brace also analyzed Neanderthal fossils in the Krapina region in former Yugoslavia. After examining remains and collections in multiple institutions in Europe, Brace spent the 1960 winter term at Oxford with the support of Nikolaas Tinbergen.</p><p>After completing his doctoral studies at Harvard under the direction of William W. Howells, Brace went on to teach at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee as Instructor in Anthropology in 1960. The following year he was invited to the University of California, Santa Barbara as Associate Professor of Anthropology. He taught there until 1965. Brace, during his time in Milwaukee and in Santa Barbara, was instrumental in driving the creation of anthropology departments independent from former joint Sociology and Anthropology Departments. Brace went on to teach at the University of Michigan as Associate Professor of Anthropology and Curator of Physical Anthropology at the University's Museum of Anthropology. In 1971 he obtained full professorship.</p><p>In subsequent years Brace traveled through England, the Netherlands, Italy, Israel, South Africa, East Africa, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia collecting dental and cranial measurements of populations and of hominid remains. During this time he also taught as visiting professor in institutions such as the University of Auckland, New Zealand (1973), University of Hawaii (1979), and Rollins College in Florida (1987). Brace had also done some short-term summer teaching during his time in Wisconsin and at the University of Colorado.</p><p>From early in his career Brace actively published through academic journals in anthropology and related fields, through his own books and in popular media as well. Among his well-known publications are <title render="italic">The Stages of Human Evolution: Human and Cultural Origins</title>, <title render="italic">Evolution in an Anthropological View</title>, and <title render="italic">Race is a Four Letter Word</title>.</p><p>Brace work is known for his claim that Neanderthals are one of four stages of human evolution and thus are ancestors to Homo Sapiens. His detailed and wide-ranging research on dentition and cranio-facial features led him to maintain that structural reduction can result from selection relaxation, also known as the Probable Mutation Effect. This was highlighted in his research on Asian populations where tooth size reduction and continuity resulted from cultural practices. His research also explored the origins of the 'race' concept, its development and application and how its use has been biologically unsupported. He suggests using the 'clines' concept and geographical names for population clusters.</p><p>In 2006 the American Association of Physical Anthropology honored Brace's achievements in the anthropological field with the Charles Darwin lifetime achievement award. His work has also been recognized by colleagues in the filed through the publication <title render="italic">Professor C. Loring Brace: Bringing Physical Anthropology ("Kicking and Screaming" Into the 21st Century!</title> In 2008, Brace retired from his long career at the University of Michigan.</p><p>-------------------------</p>

          <p>The Correspondence, 1966-2002 (7 linear feet) series is one of two correspondence series within the collection. These two series reflect Brace's original arrangement of his files in two distinct locations. These two series also cover different timeframes. Materials included in this particular series go back to the 1960s when Brace taught briefly at the University of California in Santa Barbara. Correspondence found here also covers his career at the University of Michigan as professor and as curator at the University's Museum of Anthropology. Correspondence related to his research travels can also be found here, as well as from his visiting professor stints at the University of Hawaii and the University of Auckland, Australia.</p>
          <p>Correspondence can be found here in the form of letters, printed-out electronic mail, some postcards, telegrams and other formats. Contents are arranged alphabetically and include communications with professional acquaintances, students, research institutions around the world, fellow researchers, publishers, professional organizations, and other contacts. Correspondents include: Dean Falk, Tsunehiko Hanihara, Maciej Henneberg, Ashley Montagu, Stephen Molnar, William Haviland, William Howells, Kevin Hunt, Frank Livingstone, Noriko Seguchi, Stanley Garn, Conrad Quintyn, Frank Spencer, Takery Akazawa, Phillippe Rushton, and Karen Rosenberg among others.</p>

          <p>The Research series, 1936/73-2007 (3 linear feet) is made up of two subseries; grant proposals and data. The content of these is made up of research grant proposals either reviewed by Brace or where he was involved as researcher or advisor. These proposals provide a scope of the type of research he was involved in. The data subseries is limited in context documentation for some of the material. Contents include collected raw data, statistical analyses, some graphs and representations. Considerable amounts of this data are measurements of teeth, crania, mandibles, and hominid remains.</p>

            <p>The Kennewick series, 1996-2008 (4.5 linear feet) contains documentation developed around the Kennewick Man case and research. The documents in this series include extensive correspondence and informative material to and from Alan Schneider and the firm representing eight anthropologists involved in the legal battle. Some legal documentation is also included, as well as email correspondence with colleagues, interviewers, researchers, and other people regarding Kennewick Man. There are a small number of folders with publications Brace was involved in concerning the same topic. A folder of news clippings also provides additional information on the nine year controversy.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series, 1969-1984? (4 linear feet) is made up, for the most part, of color slides. Other materials found are some illustrations, negatives, prints, a few maps, and DVDs with digital scans of crania and bones, a small number of transparencies, and some X-Rays housed as oversize materials. Among these materials there are 27 Kodak slide boxes that are part of a group. These boxes are numbered and the slides have some minimal description of the content. The majority of materials show crania, bones, teeth and mandibles. For most of the contents here there is limited date and context information.</p>
