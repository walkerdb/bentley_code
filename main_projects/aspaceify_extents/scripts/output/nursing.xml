      <p>Professional nursing education began in the United States in 1873. By 1900 there were 432 schools of nursing operating nationwide. This national trend came to Ann Arbor in 1891 when the University of Michigan Training School for Nurses was organized. The nursing program was established by the Medical School, in large part so that qualified nurses could be found to staff a newly erected University Hospital building.</p>
      <p>The connection between the hospital and the nursing program was recognized in 1912, when the school for nurses was reorganized and placed under the direct control of the University Hospital. In 1928 the program's official title was belatedly changed to University Hospital School of Nursing of the University of Michigan. In 1941 the Regents established the nursing program as an independent university teaching unit, the University of Michigan School of Nursing. Although recognized as independent, the school's senior administrative officer was not given the title of dean until 1955.</p>
      <p>The original curriculum for the school consisted of a two-year, non-degree program. In 1902 the Regents extended the basic curriculum to three years. In 1915 the first full-time instructor was hired, and in 1919 a second, five-year program, leading to the conferring of a university degree was established. In 1944 it was agreed that the combined course in the liberal arts and nursing should be phased out, in favor of a new program, leading to a bachelor of science in nursing degree.</p>
      <p>In 1952 the curriculum was radically revised. The three-year program was discontinued and replaced by a four-year program leading to a BSN. In 1961 the curriculum was expanded to include the school's first masters degree, in psychiatric nursing. The next year, 1962, a masters degree program in medical-surgical nursing was begun. The four-year program, as well as the two master degree programs, received full accreditation, through the National League for Nursing, in 1963. In 1967 the school once again extensively revised its curriculum, with the reforms being placed in effect in 1968. In 1967 the school also launched a major continuing education program for practicing nurses, funded through the Michigan Association for Regional Medical Programs. In the early 1970s the school expanded its degree programs by offering, for the first time, a research-based Ph.D. in Nursing.</p>
      <p>At its founding the school was limited to a student body of eight. This number expanded gradually. In 1912 there were about 100 students. Entrance requirements established by the turn of the century specified that students must be women, between the ages of 22 and 32, of superior education and refinement. Specific educational achievements for admission were not imposed until 1915, when possession of a high school diploma was made mandatory. In 1926 it was agreed that incoming nursing students should meet the same admission criteria as students entering the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. It was also agreed, in 1926, that nursing students would receive their basic science instruction through the Medical School. Student comfort, and the nursing program's prestige, were both increased in 1923 with the announcement of a $600,000 gift from Senator James Couzens for the construction of a nurses residence, Couzens Hall. The school's capabilities were dramatically increased in 1958 with the opening of a separate building for the school of nursing, constructed as a part of the Medical Science I complex. By 1970 the school had approximately 1,000 students, one of the largest enrollments in the nation.</p>
      <p>The tenure of Dean Rhetaugh Dumas (1981-1994), the school's first African-American dean, brought a number of organizational and curricular changes in the School of Nursing. The Center for Nursing Research was established in 1982 to serve as the central coordinating body for faculty research and to foster collaborative relationships with other units and institutions involved in related research. New programs were developed in Gerontological Nursing, Nurse-Midwifery, Occupational Health Nursing, and Home Health Care. Existing programs, including Nursing Administration, Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing, and the undergraduate studies curriculum, were completely revamped. In 1990, the school's once autonomous academic areas were realigned to form three academic divisions: the Division of Acute, Critical and Long-Term Care, which included Medical-Surgical Nursing and Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing; the Division of Health Promotion and Risk Reduction Programs, which included Community Health Nursing and Parent-Child Nursing; and the Division of Nursing Business and Health Systems Programs, which included Nursing Administration.</p>
      <p>Diversity and increased visibility on the university campus were central priorities of the school during Dean Dumas' tenure. The Office of Minority Affairs (later renamed the Office of Multicultural Affairs) was established in the 1980s to focus on the recruitment and retention of students, faculty and staff of color. Dumas was highly active in university affairs, serving on a number of presidential and university task forces and committees related to health affairs and issues affecting women and people of color. This visibility enabled the school to request and receive university funding resources to a greater degree than ever before. After years of lobbying and planning, the School of Nursing moved into renovated space at 400 North Ingalls, part of the former St. Joseph's Hospital, in 1989, the first time in many years that the entire school had been housed together.</p>

      <p>The records of the School of Nursing measure 71.5 feet, with an additional 9 feet of material in records center storage. The records date from 1891 to 1999, although the great majority of the material was created after 1940 by the current School of Nursing. Only fragmentary records of the school's two predecessor units are found in the collection. Reflecting the source of the material, the collection has been arranged into broad subgroups, the titles of which usually reflect the dean from whose office the records originated.</p>

          <p>The records of Dean Rhoda Russell (1891-1972) have been divided into two series, Committee and Faculty Records (1931-1972) and a Topical File (1891-1972). Committee and Faculty Records have been further divided into two subseries, Committee Records (1931-1972) and Faculty Records (1937-1972).</p>

            <p>Committee Records, arranged alphabetically by committee name, are particularly strong for the 1950s. Included in the subseries are annual committee reports (1951-1964/65) and extensive records of the Curriculum Committee and its many sub-committees (1947-1971). Committee documentation for the 1960s is very weak. Faculty Records, arranged alphabetically by subject, are most interesting for an almost complete run of faculty meeting minutes, 1937-1972. As in the committee records, documentation for the 1960s is very limited. For example, there are no faculty minutes for academic years 1962/63 or 1965/66</p>

            <p>Dean Russell's Topical File, which is also arranged alphabetically, contains all of the surviving documentation for the School of Nursing's predecessor units, as well as material generated during Dean Russell's term of office. Material about predecessor units is found primarily in the following file headings: History; Michigan State Government, Board of Nursing, Reports; New York State Nursing Reports; and Reports, School of Nursing, Annual. Regarding Dean Russell's own period of service, the Topical File is particularly informative regarding accreditation (filed under the National League of Nursing, the agency responsible for accreditation), curriculum changes, graduate programs, the Michigan Association for Regional Medical Programs, the Michigan League of Nursing, the Michigan State Nurses Association and the student body (filed both under Students, as well as Alumnae and Alumni, Class Lists).</p>
            <p>Because of the span of years involved, filing practices vary greatly in the Topical File. Sometimes material was gathered together under a general heading with several subheadings (such as the Michigan Association for Regional Medical Programs) while in other cases material is scattered throughout (one example is student material). Furthermore, similar, but not necessarily related, materials were often filed under the same heading. Efforts have been made in processing to correct such problems, but undoubtedly several remain undetected.</p>

          <p>The records of Dean Carolyne K. Davis and Successors (1968-1980) form the second subgroup in the School of Nursing papers. Included here are the papers of Dean Davis, Acting Dean Maxine Loomis, Dean Mary Lohr, and some of the papers of Acting Dean Norma E. Marshall. Portions of Dean Marshall's papers are also found in Dean Russell's material. The Davis and Successors subgroup have been arranged in the same way as the Russell subgroup. They have been divided into Committee and Faculty Records (1970-1980) and a Topical File (1968-1980).</p>

            <p>The Committee and Faculty Records have been subdivided into two subseries, Committee Records (1970-1980) and Faculty Records (1972-1974). Committee records have been arranged alphabetically and are most notable for the minutes of the Executive and Augmented Executive Committees (1972-1979 and 1974-1979 respectively). The Augmented Executive Committee is responsible for tenure and promotion decisions within the school. Faculty Records are very limited. Faculty meeting minutes are available only for the years 1972-1974.</p>

          <p>The subgroup Mary Ann Swain, Research Area Chairperson, accessioned in 1994, constitute an enhancement of the collection's coverage of research within the School of Nursing. Professor Swain joined the Nursing faculty in 1970, becoming Chairperson of the Research Area of the school in 1977. She was instrumental in the creation of doctoral programs at the School of Nursing and, consequently, this accession also strengthens the collection's coverage of graduate education in Nursing at the University of Michigan.</p>

          <p>Following the pattern of previous subgroups, the records of Dean Rhetaugh Dumas, received in 2000, have been mainly divided into three series: Committee Records, Faculty Records, and Topical Files. A fourth series, Facilities Files, contains unprocessed files related to the design and construction of the School of Nursing's new facility in the old St. Joseph's Hospital. While the majority of the files in this subgroup are from Dean Dumas' tenure (1981-1994), small amounts of related material from the tenures of Deans Mary Lohr (1976-1980) and Ada Sue Hinshaw (1994-present), as well as some historical materials, are also included. Additional material on Dean Dumas' tenure can be found in the 1985-1988 accessions.</p>

            <p>The contents of the Committee Records, 1974-1999 (bulk 1981-1993) (9 linear feet), and Faculty Records, 1976-1996 (2 linear feet), are similar to those of previous accessions. The Committee Records series has been divided into two subseries, Standing Committees and Task Forces and Special Committees. Of particular note within the Committee Records are large runs of meeting minutes and supporting materials for the school's administrative council and executive committee. Also included are records of the search committees for various high profile positions within the school, including the inaugural selection of the Rhetaugh Graves Dumas Endowed Professorship in Nursing.</p>

            <p>The Faculty Records are comprised of correspondence and policy documents related to faculty and agendas and minutes from school-wide faculty meetings (minutes of faculty meetings within specific academic areas are found in the Topical Files series). Dean Dumas' tenure was marked by a number of reorganizations and curricular changes, and the discussions and negotiations around these changes are reflected heavily in both the Committee Records and Faculty Records series.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files series, 1961-1999 (bulk 1981-1993) (22 linear feet), contains correspondence, charts, speeches and reports related to the school's activities and growth during this time period. Of particular note are the collected annual reports for the different academic areas and administrative offices of the school; the self-study reports prepared for the school's National League for Nursing reaccreditation in 1977, 1985, and 1993; information on the creation of the Nurse-Midwifery Program and the redesign of the Nursing Administration and Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing programs; and materials on the establishment of the school's Office of Minority Affairs (later renamed the Office of Multicultural Affairs). A small run of syllabi and other materials for School of Nursing courses is also included.</p>
            <p>Also included in the series are speeches Dean Dumas gave at various events, including School of Nursing orientations and convocations, university seminars, and nursing conferences. These speeches, in particular the dean's State of the School addresses, often comment on changes in the school and point to its future direction. The series also contains information on the dean's activities outside the university, including participation in nursing and other health-related associations, political advocacy, consulting, and research.</p>

            <p>The records of Dean Ada Sue Hinshaw will likely grow when future accessions are received, but for now are held in one series, Health Services Research Initiative Task Force, 1996 (0.75 linear feet). The series contains the records of a university-wide task force Hinshaw chaired that focused on developing strategies to support faculty conducting health services research throughout the university, with an eye to establishing a multidisciplinary institute. Included are meeting minutes and supporting materials, faculty profiles, and drafts of and comments on the task force's final report.</p>
