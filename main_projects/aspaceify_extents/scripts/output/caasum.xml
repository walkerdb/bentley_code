      <p>The University of Michigan Center for Afroamerican and African Studies (CAAS), was founded in 1970 to be a home for interdisciplinary research, teaching and community outreach. In 2011, CAAS became the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) in the College of Literature Science and the Arts (LSA).</p>
      <p>CAAS's beginnings are rooted in the era of the modern civil rights and black consciousness movements of the 1960s. Beginning in 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King, black students commandeered several campus buildings and demanded talks with new University President Robben Fleming. In addition to discussing the overall atmosphere on campus for black students, the activists voiced the first public call for a program in Black studies. A committee was charged by Rackham Dean Stephen H. Spurr to explore the possibility of creating an African-American studies program. Interest in such a program increased in 1970, when participants in the first Black Action Movement (BAM) on campus called for the establishment of a "Center for Afro-American Studies" to be based on a proposal written by J. Frank Yates, Assistant to the Dean of LSA.</p>
      <p>When the Regents established the center in the summer of 1970, its scope was broadened to include African studies, on the expectation that, "the study of Africa, Afroamerica, and the Caribbean within a single intellectual framework was not only defensible but represented the future direction of Black Studies." This "diasporic perspective" has defined the framework for study and teaching conducted by the center's faculty. The center was to offer an interdisciplinary curriculum taught by an international faculty and had a first-year enrollment of 1,026 students. Over the next two years the center acquired a "Writer in Residence" program and a visiting faculty program. CAAS faculty and students envisioned a commitment to both the University and the local and regional Black communities and over the next few years, center participants worked to find the right balance between these activities.</p>
      <p>The Ford Foundation granted CAAS funds for the project "From Margin to Center: Towards a New Black Scholarship," beginning in 1988 and additional funds for its pilot project "Strengthening African Studies." The program provided: a small seed grant program to foster collaborative research on Africa; helped fund a Summer Institute on Social Science Methods and African Studies; and an Africa Theme Semester.</p>
      <p>During its forty-year span CAAS has played host to a number of notable events and programs, including an ongoing colloquium series, the Dubois-Mandela-Rodney Fellowship Program (since 1988), and two conferences in memory of the noted poet and essayist Robert Hayden in 1980 and 1990. The center has also sponsored study abroad programs in Barbados, Jamaica, Ghana and South Africa. Since 2000, CAAS has also been the home of the South African Initiatives Office (SAIO).</p>
      <p>Originally, the Center sponsored an undergraduate concentration. An undergraduate minor was added in 2000 and a graduate certificate program began in 2005. First housed on Monroe Street, CAAS moved to West Hall and then to its current home in Haven Hall. Facilities have included a professionally staffed library and archives and an art gallery.</p>
      <p>The Lemuel A. Johnson Library at CAAS supported the curriculum by collecting and organizing archival materials related to black faculty, staff and student organizations, student activism, and national and international events relevant social justice. These files, now transferred to the Bentley, were publicly available for research and consultation. They included records relating to the BAM movements as well as several other university organizations, whose records were transferred together with the CAAS organizational archives. Brief profiles of those documented organizations follow.</p>
      <p>The Black Action Movement (BAM) was formed in 1970 from a coalition of the Black Student Union, the Black Law Students Association, the Association of Black Social Work Students, and groups of black students from the Medical School and the Psychology Department. They presented a list of demands to then University President, Robben Flemming. One of those demands, was, in fact the establishment of CAAS. There were two subsequent BAM episodes, BAM II (1974-5) and BAM III in 1985-7.</p>
      <p>The United Coalition Against Racism (UCAR) formed in the Spring of 1987 in response to a series of racist incidents on campus, including racist jokes aired on a campus radio station and a racist flyer pushed under the door of black women studying in a dormitory lounge. UCAR engaged in action aimed at U-M administrators, putting forth demands for institutional changes and convening mass protests in response to racist incidents. In addition it presented teach-ins and speakers. Originally funded by the Office of Minority Affairs (created in response to an original UCAR demand) for specific projects, other funds were provided by the organization's own fundraising and the Michigan Student Assembly.</p>
      <p>UCAR also founded the Ella Baker-Nelson Mandela Center for Anti-Racist Education, or the Baker-Mandela Center (BMC) during the summer of 1988. Its purpose was to collect and generate literature, provide a speakers bureau, and to serve as a gathering place for anti-racist activists. The overall objectives were to promote anti-racist consciousness and to promote anti-racist student leaders, particularly within Third World communities; to heighten the level of discussion and research on various aspects of race, class and gender issues and to provide concrete tools to anti-racist organizers to help refute stereotypes and myths, and challenge apathy or cynicism. It was housed in the East Engineering Building. Barbara Ransby and Tracye Matthews were important leaders in the organization of the center.</p>
      <p>The University of Michigan Free South Africa Coordinating Committee (FSACC) was a diverse campus-based group of faculty and students opposed to the Apartheid system in South Africa, founded in the Spring of 1985. The group's aims included producing literature, sponsoring events and pressuring institutions to sever economic ties with corporations doing business in South Africa. FSACC records concern activism during the 1980s and early 1990s, especially the construction of an "anti-apartheid shanty" on the University of Michigan Diag and a petition to grant Nelson Mandela an honorary degree.</p>
      <p>The Students of Color Coalition (SCC), another campus-based group, formed to protest the mocking use of Native American names, images and regalia by a semi-secret student honor society called Michigamua. In early 2000, SCC members occupied the Michigamua offices in the tower of the Michigan Union for thirty-seven days. As a result of the controversy, Michigamua agreed to stop using Native American practices, and in 2006 adopted a new name, "The Order of Angell."</p>

      <p>The records of the Center for Afroamerican and African Studies (CAAS) include correspondence, syllabi, clippings, publicity materials, photographs and audio and video recordings of campus speakers. The record group includes archival material that was originally collected and made available in CAAS's library relating to black activism and to organizations of interest to black students, faculty and staff, as well as CAAS's own organizational archives. Because these materials have been consulted and cited by researchers prior to their transfer to the Bentley in 2011, their original arrangement has been preserved so far as possible.</p>
      <p>Paper and photographic records consist of three major series: Black student activism, 1969-2001 (5.5 linear feet), Blacks at U-M, 1969-2007 (4.5 linear feet) and Organizational archives of CAAS, 1962-2010 (17 linear feet) (formerly designated simply "Archives.") There is some overlap of subject matter. These categories reflect the organization of the materials imposed by CAAS librarians and archivists prior to transfer to the Bentley in 2011.</p>
      <p>The following list identifies the greatest concentration of material relevant to some of the notable subjects in the collection:
        <list type="simple"><item>The Black Action Movements (Boxes 1-2 and 55)</item><item>Incidents of on-campus harassment and responses (Boxes 1, 2, 4)</item><item>South Africa, apartheid, and divestment -- (Boxes 2, 3, 5)</item><item>Free South Africa Coordinating Committee (Box 3)</item><item>Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid (Box 5)</item><item>United Coalition Against Racism and the Baker-Mandela Center (Boxes 1, 4, 5)</item><item>The Michigamua controversy (Box 3)</item><item>The Nelson Mandela Honorary Degree Petition (Boxes 3, 11)</item><item>Gulf War activism (Boxes 3, 4)</item></list>
      </p>
      <p>This record group also includes a large number of audio and video recordings of presentations, interviews, documentaries, and cultural performances from the 1970s to the 1990s. The recordings include several notable faculty members, visiting scholars, and activists, including Harold Cruse, Cornell West, Rita Dove, Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis, Marian Wright Edelman and Rosa Parks.</p>
      <p>The audio-visual material in the collection is organized is organized in to six series by format: Audio recordings on cassettes, 1975-2001 (486 cassettes, 9 linear feet), U-Matic videotapes, 1971-1989 (91 videotapes, 9.1 linear ft.) VHS videotapes, 1971-2004 (131 videotapes, 7 linear feet), Open reel videotapes, 1971-1980 (12 videotapes, 1 linear feet), Reel-to-reel audiotape, 1971, 1980 and undated (4 audiotapes, 0.3 linear feet) and Mini DVDs, 1999-2000 and undated (24 Mini-DVDs, 0.2 linear feet).</p>

          <p>The series Black student activism, 1969-2001 (5.5 linear feet) contains four alphabetically arranged subseries relating to the Black Action Movements (BAM) on the University of Michigan campus: BAM I, 1969-1987 (0.4 linear feet), BAM II, 1974-1975 (0.1 linear ft.), BAM III, 1985-1995 (0.5 linear feet) and Conferences and Scholarship about BAM, 1970-2001 (0.1 linear feet). These records include correspondence, newspaper clippings, minutes and other records of the United Coalition Against Racism (UCAR), and they address both the movements themselves and reactions to them within the university community. There are also documents concerning incidents of racial harassment that had a part in inspiring the movements.</p>
          <p>A fifth subseries, Other activism,1966-2000 (3.9 linear feet), includes newspaper clippings about the civil rights movement; and the anti-apartheid and divestment movements of the 1980s, as well as records of several activist organizations, particularly the Free South Africa Coordinating Committee (FSACC), and the Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid (WCCAA). Some of these records pertain to activities on campus, but most are concerned with political and civil rights causes that are national or international in scope. The Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid (WCCAA) records document that organization's efforts to encourage the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor banks to divest their holdings in South Africa.</p>
          <p>More records relating to UCAR and the Baker -Mandela Center (BMC) are presented in the "Other activism" subseries, and pertain to activism and events at the University of Michigan during the 1980s and 1990s. Though UCAR and the BMC were separate entities, their records have been arranged together as a result of their frequent and close collaboration.</p>

          <p>The third series, CAAS organizational archives, 1962-2010 (17 linear ft.) includes correspondence and administrative files; course descriptions and syllabi; articles and research by faculty members and visiting scholars; and fliers and programs from CAAS events. The series is divided into nineteen subseries: Administrative records, 1970-2010 (1 linear ft.), Brown bags and colloquia, 1970-1998 (0.6 linear ft.), Committees and meetings, 1974-1993 (0.2 linear ft.), Conferences, 1991-2002 (1 linear ft.), Co-sponsored programs, 1979-1995 (0.1 linear ft.), Courses and syllabi, 1970-2009 (1.9 linear ft.), Directors files, Kevin Gaines, 1974-2009 (restricted) (0.7 linear ft.), History, 1970-1981 (0.2 linear ft.), Library, 1970-2000 (0.6 linear ft.), Persons, faculty, 1962-2005 (5 linear ft.), Persons, non-faculty, 1986-2001 (0.1 linear ft.), Programs and events, 1972-2002 (0.3 linear ft.), Publications, 1971-2000 (0.6 linear ft.), Research projects, 1982-1997 (1 linear ft.), Rodney, Walter, Student Essay Competition, 1985-1997 (0.1 linear ft.), Study abroad, 1986-2005 (0.4 linear ft.), Working papers, 1990-1998 (1.1 linear ft.), Photographs, 1997-1994 (0.8 linear ft.) and Posters, (1 outsized folder).</p>
          <p>All of these subseries are arranged alphabetically, with the exception of the Working Papers subseries. That subseries derives from faculty and graduate student conferences and lectures in the 1990s and its arrangement derives from a numbering system used by CAAS. Not all of the papers were transferred, as there are gaps in the sequence.</p>
          <p>The records in the largest subseries, Persons, faculty, 1962-2005 (5 linear ft.), are not personnel files and do not contain sensitive information but are primarily biographical, and consist largely of publications by and about faculty members. Occasional administrative records can also be found among the faculty records.</p>
          <p>Researchers interested in the history of CAAS will find useful material in the History subseries in Box 16, and in the audio and video recordings relating to the 20th Anniversary of CAAS in 1991. Reports on the results of the Ford Foundation-funded research projects, referenced above in the administrative history of the unit, are given in the Research projects subseries, under the heading "Ford Foundation Project."</p>

          <p>The series "Audio recordings on cassettes" contains 486 cassettes, and largely consists of spoken word recordings of talks and professional meetings. Many of these cassettes have been digitized. The quality of these recordings is uneven -- some are very good, and others were made with portable recording equipment by volunteers. Because of uncertainty about the copyright status of these recordings, the digitized files are available for use in the reading room only.</p>
          <p>The cassettes are divided into seventeen subseries, arranged chronologically unless otherwise indicated: Early recorded speakers, tapes 1-76, 1975-1984 (arranged alphabetically by speaker's name); Jamaica Study Abroad Program, tapes 77-109, 1991 (arranged by tape number designated by CAAS); Gender and Urban Poverty Conference, tapes 110-116, 1996; Brown bag talks, tapes 117-202, 1986-1995; Dialogue series, tapes 203-221, 1991-1993; Robert Hayden Memorial, tapes 222-235, 1990, Workshop on Strengthening CAAS and Africana Studies at U-M, tapes 236-243, 1989, CAAS Symposium for Black History Month: Black American Families, tapes 244-253, 1991, Inventions of Africa: Africa in the Literatures of the Continent and the Diaspora Workshops, tapes 254-258, 1991-1992, CAAS 20th Anniversary, tapes 259-271, 1991, Race, Culture and the Politics of Intellectual Inquiry Lecture Series, tapes 272-278, 1991-1992, Remapping of Scholarship: African peoples in the Industrial Age, tapes , tapes 279-284, 1994, Graduate Student Conference [became Student of Color of Rackham (SCOR), tapes 285-293, 1991-1993, Barbados, tapes 310-330, 1989, Martin Luther King (MLK) Day, tapes 331-350, 1987-1992, CAAS Mini-course 324: Black Educational Achievement over the Life-Course, tapes 351-361, 1988, and Chronological events, tapes 352-486, 1983-2001.
