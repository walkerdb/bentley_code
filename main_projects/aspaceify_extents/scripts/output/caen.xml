      <p>The Computer-Aided Engineering Network (CAEN) is organized as a department reporting to the College of Engineering's Dean's office and is led by the Executive Director of Information Technology. CAEN supplies comprehensive information technology services and resources to faculty, staff, and students of the College of Engineering. In addition to offering computer labs, software, and collaborative work environments, CAEN promotes the use of high performance computing resources in support of teaching and research and provides assistance and consulting to faculty.</p>
      <p>CAEN was created in 1983 under the leadership of College Dean James Duderstadt, Associate Dean Daniel Atkins, and its first director, Richard L. Philips (who served until 1986). The original plan called for 400 to 500 personal computer workstations on U-M's Central and North Campuses that would link faculty and students to laboratories, classrooms, offices, and dorms. The initiative was highly innovative at the time and established a model that other institutions would follow in the ensuing decades.</p>
      <p>In its first year, CAEN offered 100 Apple Lisa computers for open computing use by all Engineering students in three labs (145 Chrysler Center, 2070 Dow, and the Engineering Library). The following years would see CAEN expand the number and size of labs as well as offer new services for its user community. Telnet services became available in 1988 and the Pine email program entered wide use in 1994, the same year that CAEN and the College appeared on the World Wide Web. 1994 also marked the establishment of Camp CAEN, a "computer exploration camp" that introduced computer science and computer engineering to middle and high school students. During this period, CAEN was led by Randall Frank, who succeeded Philips in 1986 and served until 1995, at which point Paul Killey assumed leadership of the division.</p>
      <p>In 1996, the recently completed Integrated Technology Instruction Center (ITIC) was renamed the Media Union (and would later become the Duderstadt Center) and CAEN became one of its first residents. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, CAEN continued to expand its resources and services. Mark Giuffrida was named Director of CAEN in 2001 and as of 2012, the division was jointly led by Giuffrida and Paul Killey, who also serves as Executive Director of Information Technology for the College.</p>

      <p>The Computer-Aided Engineering Network (CAEN) records give insight into the evolution of the division's facilities and infrastructure and document the various administrators, staff, and students who have contributed to its success. The materials will be particularly useful to those interested in computing in higher education and as well as in the development of academic IT infrastructure. The CAEN records are comprised of two series: Visual Materials and Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Materials.</p>

          <p>The CAEN Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Materials series contains born-digital and digitized content created for the anniversary of the unit's founding in 2008. The series has four main components: signs and placards used to create exhibits; posters used at the 25th anniversary celebration and for an online exhibit; a timeline of important events and innovations over CAEN's first 25 years; and a video of the 25th anniversary exhibits. The placards provide information about hardware and infrastructure employed by CAEN over the years and the posters includes digitized images of photographs in the Visual Materials series. The video documents the exhibit created for CAEN's 25th anniversary and includes footage of various computers and hardware used by the division as well as short introductory pieces by Paul Killey, Mark Giuffrida, and Dan Maleta.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series contains content in various formats that document the people, facilities, infrastructure, and events of CAEN. Video footage includes VHS tapes and a U-Matic tape from the 1980s and 1990s provide a look into CAEN labs and facilities (including a behind-the-scenes tour of the Integrated Technology Instructional Center during its construction), a CAEN/ITD Quiz Bowl during the units 10th anniversary in 1993, and interviews with important administrators about the development of CAEN. A 2005 promotional video gives a thorough overview of Camp CAEN. Photographic materials are comprised of color slides, contact sheets, negatives, and photo albums. Taken together, these materials provide a comprehensive view of CAEN through the late 1990s, with extensive portraits of staff and administrators, images of facilities and hardware, and candid photos of students and personnel at various events. The majority of the photographic materials were taken by CAEN staff member Ann Gordon.</p>
