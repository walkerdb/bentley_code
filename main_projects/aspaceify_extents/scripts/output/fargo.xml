      <p>Fargo Engineering Company of Jackson, Michigan was the outgrowth of the engineering business started in 1895 by William G. Fargo, a pioneer in hydroelectric engineering. In 1888, Fargo opened an office in Jackson that performed general mapping and surveying work. In 1893 he published a detailed property map of Jackson, and in 1895, he began making surveys of Michigan rivers for water power developments. This work resulted in much of the electric power development in Michigan by Consumers Power Company. In 1913 William G. Fargo started the Fargo Engineering Company, which was incorporated in 1921.</p>
      <p>From 1900 until his retirement in 1925, Fargo and his company provided civil engineering design and construction supervision services in connection with power plants and railways for the Michigan companies that later merged to form the Commonwealth and Southern Corporation. The company carried out hydraulic investigations of many Michigan rivers and did experimental engineering work in hydro-power. In particular, Fargo Engineering did much experimental work in spillway design incorporating "Tainter" gates (a form of radial gate adapted to timber construction which had been patented by Jeremiah B. Tainter of Menomonie, Wisconsin), evaporation studies in connection with reservoirs, and investigation of possible dam sites in Michigan and elsewhere. The company, in addition, made topographic surveys of most of the rivers in Michigan's Lower Peninsula and specialized in dams built on soil foundations. During this period, the company completed sixty-one hydroelectric plants and nine major power steam plants in twenty-nine states. The company also designed high tension transmission lines, power substations and office and factory buildings.</p>
      <p>Some of the more important hydroelectric and steam power generating plants the Fargo Company built in Michigan while Fargo was with the firm are the Mio, Alcona, Loud, Five Channels, Cooke and Foote plants on the AuSable River, the Webber on the Grand River, the Ceresco, Plainwell, Otsego and Trowbridge plants on the Kalamazoo River, and the Junction plant on the Manistee River. In addition to Jackson, steam plants bearing the Fargo imprint are at Battle Creek, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids and Flint.</p>
      <p>While Fargo Engineering Company was largely concerned with the design of power plants in Michigan, it also provided design, construction and consulting services for other Midwestern power syndicates, including: the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company of South Bend, Indiana, the Iowa Railway and Light Company of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and the Wisconsin-Minnesota Light and Power Company. Additionally, Fargo Engineering supervised construction of several hydro-electric sites in New England and designed five plants with automatic flood gates on the Guadalupe River of Texas for Texas Power Corporation and Texas Hydro-electric Corporations.</p>
      <p>Born in Jackson on December 6, 1867, William G. Fargo was a nationally known civil engineer, city planner and naturalist. In addition to his work in hydroelectric power construction, Fargo was an early developer of the city of Jackson and was considered the "father" of the city zoning ordinance. William Fargo remained active in zoning and city development until 1948, well past his 1925 retirement from Fargo Engineering Company. A noted scientist, he was an honorary curator of birds and paleozoology at the University of Michigan Museum of paleontology and zoology and contributed substantially to the museum's bird specimen collection. He remained unmarried throughout his lifetime and died at the age of 89 on February 2, 1957.</p>

            <p>The Alphabetical Cross Index Of Jobs subseries (1 bound volume) cross-indexes most Fargo Engineering Company jobs by name to alternate names, location (according to city, associated river, or both), Fargo job number, and client company. When used in conjunction with this finding aid, the researcher will find this document to be a useful reference tool.</p>

            <p>The Visual Materials subseries (6.5 linear feet) consists mainly of single site photograph albums, arranged alphabetically by state (Connecticut, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Texas, and Wisconsin). These albums are further arranged alphabetically by construction site within the appropriate state. The albums document various hydroelectric, power plant, and dam construction projects undertaken by Fargo Engineering Company mainly in the period from 1906 to 1940. Within the Wisconsin grouping, however, there are four photograph albums which date from 1949 to 1951. The Michigan grouping is the largest, and contains extensive visual documentation of many large lower peninsula power projects undertaken between 1905 and 1937. Individual photographs in the albums have been well documented by Fargo Engineering, with most containing a job number and (or) date on each print. An attempt has been made in this finding aid to supply a location, Fargo job number, and surrounding dates for each album. The researcher can discover alternate names and the client for each job by referring to the Alphabetical Cross Index Of Jobs mentioned above.</p>
            <p>While most of the state albums contain jobs for that state alone, there are some exceptions within the Michigan albums. The Irving Powerhouse and Dam album contains the Inks Dam in Texas, the Elk Rapids album contains the Nashua Dam in Iowa, and the Miscellaneous Michigan Sites album contains one site in Sheboygan, Wisconsin as well as multiple Michigan sites.</p>
            <p>The Visual Materials subseries also includes seven glass plate negatives (unidentified), four multiple-site photograph albums, a single unidentified site in a post album, two folders of loose photograph album pages (Michigan and non-Michigan sites), and three folder of individual photographs (labeled Michigan, non-Michigan, and unidentified work sites).</p>

An associated site name, Fargo job number and surrounding dates for each book has been provided in this finding aid, where possible. The books vary in content, including: topographical survey notes, level books, wage and hour books and general site notes associated with Fargo construction sites. The books were produced by the head and surveying engineers on each site. Some books contain: photographs, blueprints, maps, indexes and references to photographs found in associated albums in this collection. Therefore, a researcher using a particular album or researching a particular site is advised to search for associated field notes in the list provided herein.</p>

          <p>The Office Files series consists of the following subseries: Corporate Specifications, Contracts and Test Procedures; Business Correspondence of William G. Fargo; and Printed Materials. Corporate specifications, contracts and test procedures (.3 linear feet) has been maintained in the original alphabetical order assigned by Fargo Engineering. The Business Correspondence Of William G. Fargo (.5 linear feet) subseries contains five bound volumes of correspondence (dated 1897-1905) of William G. Fargo, largely relating to the construction of an interurban/electric trolley system for Jackson, Michigan. The volumes are arranged numerically according to original volume number. Each volume was meticulously indexed by the author, and each page is numbered. The Printed Materials subseries is made up of one folder containing promotional sales literature put out by Fargo Engineering. This material can be used to identify completed works accomplished by Fargo Engineering.</p>
