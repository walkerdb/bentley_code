        <p>The size of the O'Hara collection has been significantly reduced during the course of processing the papers. Duplicate items and most government publications were removed, accounting for about one-third of the bulk reduction. Several series were eliminated completely. The largest of these was an "Alphabetical File" consisting of second carbons of responses to constituent mail. Largely eliminated were the "Departmental" and "Case Files" series. These consisted mainly of routine communications, announcements, etc. from federal departments and agencies, requests from constituents for assistance or information on matters such as social security, naturalization, military discharges and draft deferments. Also largely eliminated were extensive files on post office job openings and construction, local government grant applications, and the administration of public works projects in O'Hara's district.</p>
        <p>Selected items from some of the eliminated series were retained and interfiled in the legislative subject file. The legislative file itself was weeded to eliminate much extraneous material of limited informational value or outside the area of O'Hara's activities and interests. Particularly voluminous, but essentially repetitive, files of constituent correspondence on issues such as abortion, gun control, and busing were reduced by a non-systematic selection process. The bulk of pre-printed cards and form letters were also eliminated.</p>
        <p>The processing and weeding of the O'Hara papers have focused the collection on those activities, events, and issues most significant in James O'Hara's career as a congressman and Democratic Party official.</p>

      <p>James O'Hara was a Democratic congressman from the 7th and 12th districts of Michigan from 1959 to 1976. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee O'Hara was involved in shaping much of the major labor and education legislation enacted during the period. He came to be regarded as one of the principal spokesmen for organized labor in the House and was recognized as an expert on House rules and legislative tactics. O'Hara was an active participant in reform movements within the House and in the national Democratic Party. He was a founding member of the House Democratic Study Group and chaired the Democratic National Committee's Commission on Rules, 1969-1972. O'Hara gave up his seat in the House of Representatives to run for the United States Senate in 1976.</p>
      <p>James Grant O'Hara was born November 8. 1925 in Washington, DC His family moved to Detroit when he was fourteen and O'Hara graduated from Detroit University High School in 1943. O'Hara then enlisted in the army, serving with Company B, 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 11th Airborne Division. He saw combat action as a paratrooper in the Pacific theater. After his discharge from the army in April 1946, O'Hara enrolled in the University of Michigan. He received his bachelor degree in 1954 and a law degree in 1955. O'Hara married Susan Puskas in 1953 and is the father of seven children. From 1955 to 1958 O'Hara practiced law in Detroit.</p>
      <p>O'Hara made his first bid for elective office in 1958. He secured the Democratic Party nomination for Congress from the 7th district by winning a narrow victory in the primary election. O'Hara then won the general election in the traditionally Republican district by a margin of 2768 votes. O'Hara was reelected in 1960 by a margin of 18,000 votes. Thereafter his electoral victories were generally by margins of two or three to one. The sole exception was the 1972 campaign when the effects of redistricting, a weak Democratic national ticket, and the divisive busing issue resulted in a victory margin of less than 3000 votes.</p>
      <p>The 7th congressional district, which O'Hara represented from 1959-1962, consisted of Macomb, Huron, Lapeer, St. Clair, Sanilac and Tuscola counties. In the redistricting of 1962 a new 12th district was consisting of Macomb County and a small part of Wayne County. O'Hara elected to establish his residence in the 12th district and represented the area from 1963-1976. The 12th district was enlarged in 1972 to include all of Macomb County except Sterling Heights and part of Warren City, St. Clair County, Avon township in Oakland County, and Buell, Fremont, and Worth townships in Sanilac County.</p>
      <p>In his freshman term O'Hara was assigned to the Education and Labor Committee and played a significant role in the attempts to soften the anti-labor features of the Landrum-Griffin bill. He served on the Education and Labor Committee for his entire congressional career, eventually becoming one of the ranking Democratic members. He chaired a special subcommittee on migrant labor, 1971-1972, and the Special Subcommittee on Higher Education, 1973-1976. As chair of the latter subcommittee O'Hara received national attention for his work on revision of the student financial assistance programs and the control of college tuition costs.</p>
      <p>O'Hara also served on the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 1967-1974, and on the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations, 1973-1974. In 1973 O'Hara was appointed to the special "Hansen Committee" on reorganization of the House. Among its other recommendations, the Hansen Committee called for the creation of a House Budget Committee and the establishment of the Congressional Budget Office. In the 94th Congress O'Hara gave up his seat on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee to accept a position on the new Budget Committee.</p>
      <p>During his second term in Congress, O'Hara was elected to serve as regional Democratic whip for Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. He held that position throughout his career and came to be recognized as one of the Democrat's most skilled floor leaders and legislative strategists. O'Hara was one of the leaders of the group of younger, generally liberal congressmen who led the fight to revive and reform the House Democratic caucus and to challenge the absolute authority of committee chairmen under the seniority system. In 1971 O'Hara waged an unsuccessful campaign for majority leader of the House.</p>
      <p>A founding member of the Democratic Study Group in 1959, O'Hara served as vice chairman of the liberal reform group in 1965-1966 and as chairman in 1967-1968. O'Hara also participated in the Conference of Great Lakes Congressmen and was elected to succeed John Blatnik as chairman of the group in the 94th Congress.</p>
      <p>O'Hara served on a number of national Democratic Party committees and commissions. He was frequently a delegate to the party's national convention and served on the credentials committee of the 1968 convention. After the disruptions of the 1968 convention, O'Hara was appointed by the Democratic National Committee to head a Commission on Party Rules. The Commission, which held hearings and meetings from 1969-1972, was charged with making recommendations for the rules and procedures for the 1972 Democratic convention. O'Hara was chairman of the 1972 Convention Rules Committee and also acted as parliamentarian for the convention.</p>
      <p>Following the 1972 convention O'Hara was appointed to the Democratic Party Charter Commission headed by Terry Sanford. He was also a member of the Commission on the Selection of Vice Presidential Candidates. Though not a member of the Mikulski Commission on Delegate Selection, O'Hara worked closely with it and later served on the Compliance Review Commission charged with enforcing the Mikulski Commission's delegate selection guidelines for the 1976 party convention.</p>
      <p>O'Hara was a charter member and national co-chairman of the Coalition for a Democratic Majority. This organization of "regular Democrats" was formed in the aftermath of the landslide defeat the Democratic party suffered in 1972. It was opposed to the "new politics" represented by the McGovern faction of the party and sought to revise the reforms instituted after the 1968 convention.</p>
      <p>In 1976 O'Hara sought the Democratic Party nomination for United States senator to succeed the retiring Phil Hart. O'Hara lost the primary election to Donald Riegle and Richard Austin. After finishing out his term in the 94th Congress O'Hara returned to the practice of law. He died March 13, 1989.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Legislative Files series contains material relating to pending or proposed legislation, congressional investigations, and a variety of issues of local or national importance. The bulk of the subject files concern issues that came before the committees on which O'Hara served most notably labor, education, and natural resources and pollution. Other files reflect issues of particular concern to O'Hara's constituents, of personal or professional concern to O'Hara, or of general national interest.</p>
            <p>The subject files consist primarily of correspondence from constituents, fellow members of Congress, or parties interested in legislative action on a subject, staff memoranda and background papers, and occasionally transcripts of hearings or committee meetings. The Legislative series is arranged chronologically by Congress and thereunder alphabetically by subject. Individual items have generally not been systematically arranged within folders.</p>
            <p>The labor subject files contain information on the passage of the Landrum-Griffin Act, the Manpower Training and Development Act, minimum wage and overtime pay legislation proposed by O'Hara, the McNamara-O'Hara Services Contract Act, reform of the National Labor Relations Act, common situs picketing, pension fund protection, mine safety, and other topics.</p>
            <p>O'Hara took a particular interest in the problems of migrant workers. The files reflect his repeated attempts to extend the National Labor Relations Act to cover migrant labor and efforts to provide farm workers with the protection of minimum wage, workman's compensation, and occupational safety legislation. The files also illuminate O'Hara's close relationship with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers Union.</p>
            <p>The education files document O'Hara's role in the formulation of most of the significant education legislation enacted during the period, most notably the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and subsequent amendments to both acts. There are extensive files from O'Hara's tenure as chairman of the Special Subcommittee on Higher Education. Major topics include college tuition costs; student financial assistance, particularly the Guaranteed Student Loan, Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, and work study programs; sexual discrimination and affirmative action programs in higher education; and the conflict between the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Amateur Athletic Union over the control of amateur athletics.</p>
            <p>The Natural Resources/Pollution files represents a combination of material originally scattered under several subject headings. The most significant-of these combined files relate to O'Hara's repeated sponsorship of-legislation to create the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Shoreline, flood control and pollution cleanup on the Clinton River, and the National Land Use Planning Act.</p>
            <p>Other significant subject files include civil rights and busing, foreign affairs, gun control, and congressional and electoral college reform. O'Hara gained some notice in his first term for his efforts to strengthen the voting rights bill of 1960. He was later intimately involved in the passage of the civil rights acts of 1964 and 1966 and the 1965 voting rights act. O'Hara also played a role in the move to prevent the seating of the Mississippi congressional delegation in 1965.</p>
            <p>Though a consistent opponent of racial and sexual discrimination, O'Hara became an outspoken critic of affirmative action plans that employed quotas. O'Hara also took a strong position against busing to achieve racial integration of schools. The files include voluminous correspondence from his constituents on the Detroit busing controversy and material on O'Hara's efforts to secure statutory and constitutional prohibitions on busing. Material on civil rights and busing can also be found in the Legislative files under the labor and education headings and in the Political series under the 1972 campaign.</p>
            <p>The Vietnam War is the major topic covered in the foreign affairs subject files. O'Hara was generally a loyal supporter of the Johnson administration policy in Vietnam through 1968. He later advocated a gradual American withdrawal. The Vietnam files consist mainly of constituent correspondence. There is some material illustrating O'Hara's efforts to maintain congressional support for Johnson administration policy and his eventual switch to a moderate criticism of the war effort.</p>

            <p>O'Hara's congressional campaigns, 1958-1974, and his 1976 senatorial campaign are documented in the Political series. The series is arranged chronologically and files for each campaign may include brochures and campaign literature, press releases, correspondence and memoranda, polling data, and position papers. There is usually a folder of material on O'Hara's opponent. Also filed in this series is one folder on the "Liberal Papers" incident which became an issue in the 1962 campaign, material from O'Hara's service as head of the Michigan Humphrey-Muskie campaign in 1968, and papers concerning O'Hara's campaign to succeed Carl Albert as House majority leader in 1971.</p>

              <p>After the tumultuous events of 1968, the Democratic National Committee appointed two commissions to review the rules and procedures of the party and to recommend reforms to be implemented for the 1972 national convention. The Commission on Party Structure and Delegation Selection was first headed by George McGovern and then Donald Fraser.</p>
              <p>The Commission on Rules, which O'Hara chaired, was mandated to codify and study the rules of past Democratic conventions and to propose permanent rules for the committees of the convention and for the convention itself. O'Hara conducted a series of hearings and meetings across the country and his commission issued a final report entitled "Call to Order ..." The Commissions recommendations were presented to the Rules Committee of the 1972 Democratic Convention, of which O'Hara was also chairman.</p>
              <p>The O'Hara and McGovern-Fraser Commissions collaborated to prepare a draft charter for the party which was presented to the 1972 convention for consideration. The convention did not adopt the draft charter but did call for a Charter Commission to be established to prepare a party charter for consideration at a mid-term convention. O'Hara was appointed to the Charter Commission headed by Terry Sanford.</p>
              <p>The Mikulski Commission was appointed by the Democratic National Committee in September 1972 to review the party's delegate selection procedure. O'Hara was not a member of the Commission but he did testify before it and followed its activities closely. In 1974 O'Hara was appointed to the Democratic Party Compliance Review Commission which was charged with enforcing the Mikulski Commission's delegate selection guidelines.</p>
              <p>The papers relating to these commissions and committees include staff memoranda, background and issues papers, transcripts of hearing or copies of statements made to the commissions, reports and resolutions, and correspondence with commission members, Democratic Party officials, and members of the public.</p>

          <p>The bulk of the Post-Congressional Subgroup consists of correspondence and other files from the years 1976 to 1987 and relate to his work as a member of the Federal Minimum Wage Study Commission and his various responsibilities with the Democratic Party. O'Hara's involvement with Ted Kennedy's bid for the presidency in 1980 is especially well represented.</p>
