    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Volney Hurt Jones was born on April 30, 1903 in Comanche, Texas. He received an Associate in Science certificate from North Texas Agricultural College in 1927 and a B.A. in agriculture from Texas A&amp;M; University in 1929. He then enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Biology at the University of New Mexico, studying ethnobotany under Edward Castetter. Jones was awarded a master's degree in 1931.</p>
      <p>In 1931, Jones left New Mexico to take a position as a student assistant in the Ethnobotanical Laboratory at the University of Michigan's Museum of Anthropology, working under Melvin Gilmore. With Gilmore in poor health, Jones was called upon to take over much of the work of the lab almost from the earliest days of his appointment. When Gilmore died in 1940, Jones became head of the lab and the museum's ethnographic collections, though he did not receive the full official title of Curator of Ethnology until 1945. Jones also taught in the Department of Anthropology, and was particularly known for his popular course on Native Americans. He was named assistant professor in 1945 and associate professor in 1952. Jones held these positions until his retirement in 1969. Jones spent his entire professional career at Michigan, though he took a fifteen-month leave of absence from the university to work in rubber production in Haiti during World War II.</p>
      <p>The Ethnobotanical Laboratory served as a central facility for researchers throughout the country to send ethnological and archaeological plant specimens for taxonomic identification and analysis. This work brought Jones in contact with many of the major figures in the fields of archaeology and ethnobotany, and the analyses from the over 350 specimen reports Jones authored were cited countless times in field reports and publications (though Jones did not always receive proper attribution).</p>
      <p>Jones conceived of ethnobotany as much broader than simple identification and listing of plant samples, however. His ecological perspective on the field, which he defined as "the study of the interrelationships between primitive man and plants," was instilled in the many students he mentored over the years and shaped its future development. Jones was particularly notable for his pioneering work in paleoethnobotany; little recognized at the time they were done, Jones' studies of the biological remains of archaeological sites received renewed attention through the ongoing research of his former students, particularly Richard Yarnell, Vorsila Bohrer, and Richard Ford. In the late 1960s, Jones work at the University also involved consulting for a series of TV productions on Native Americans done in collaboration with the University of Michigan Law School and Television Center called Silent Heritage.</p>
      <p>Jones' interest in Native Americans extended to his activities outside of the university as well. He served on several state commissions related to Native Americans in Michigan. He was also president of the Memorial to the American Indian Foundation, an organization formed in Ann Arbor in 1953 with an eye to erecting a sculpture in Gallup, New Mexico. Jones was also sometimes called upon to use his ethnobotanical knowledge in unusual ways, including serving as an expert witness from the 1940s to 1960s in the identification of marijuana plants for criminal cases.</p>
      <p>Jones was married to Joyce Hedrick, a mycologist, from 1933 until her death in 1978. They had one son, Alan, born in 1937. Jones died on December 12, 1982 in Ann Arbor.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series, 1930-1979 (2 linear feet), contains Jones' incoming and outgoing personal and professional correspondence, spanning from 1930 to 1979. The files are arranged alphabetically by correspondent, with files of miscellaneous correspondence at the end of each letter range.</p>
          <p>Much of Jones' professional correspondence consists of discussions with other ethnobotanists and anthropologists about their laboratory research, field work, and analysis of organic samples. Jones' correspondence also serves as documentation of the beginnings of the field of paleoethnobotany. Correspondents of note include Edward Castetter (Jones' mentor at the University of New Mexico) and Leslie White. The files for Theodore (Ted) Bank include substantial information on a University of Michigan expedition to the Aleutians in the late 1940s. The dating of material from Sandia Cave is discussed in correspondence with Frank Hibben and Alex Krieger. Correspondence with Chase S. Osborn, Stellanova B. Osborn, and Milo M. Quaife concerning a project to establish a Friends of the Michigan Indian organization can be found in the Stellanova Osborn folder.</p>

          <p>The Biographies and Bibliographies series, bulk 1950s-1970s (1.25 linear feet), contains research materials, bibliographies, and biographical sketches for prominent anthropologists, with particular focus on ethnographers. While Jones compiled much of the supporting research himself from the 1950s to 1970s, many of the brief biographical sketches were written by students in Jones' Department of Anthropology course, Anthropology 557: Aboriginal Cultures of North America. The contents of the files range from a single citation to an obituary or published biography to a full biographical sketch. The most comprehensive of the sketches is one of James B. Griffin, written by Jones with handwritten amendments by Griffin. A few of the files include correspondence concerning Jones' research into a particular biographical subject.</p>

          <p>The Culture Areas series, bulk 1930s-1960s (1 linear foot), includes correspondence, notes, reports and citations related to various culture areas, with particular emphasis on plants. Much of the material is undated. While these were primarily reference files, they may have also been compiled in anticipation of authoring a textbook; Jones' order and arrangement of the files has been preserved. In addition to Jones' notes, drafts and outlines, the files include materials written or compiled by others, most notably Jones' mentor at Michigan, Melvin Gilmore. The section on the Plains Region, in particular, includes a number of Gilmore manuscripts and research materials. Jones' thesis on <title render="italic">The Ethnobotany of the Isleta Indians</title> can also be found within this series.</p>

          <p>The Ethnobotany Textbook Files series, ca. 1945-1978 (0.75 linear feet), includes outlines, notes, drafts, and correspondence Jones compiled for a planned textbook on ethnobotany that he worked on from approximately 1945 to 1978 but never completed. Much of the material is undated. While a complete outline for the book is not found in the papers, Jones' order and arrangement of the files has been preserved to give a sense of the book's intended organization. As with the Culture Areas series, the files include material written or compiled by others, as well as by Jones.</p>
