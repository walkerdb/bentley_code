      <p>The first formal program in library education at the University of Michigan began in 1909, when the University Librarian, Theodore Koch, began a summer program in "library methods." In 1918, Koch's successor, William Warner Bishop raised the entrance requirement for this summer program to a minimum of thirty hours of college credit.</p>
      <p>In the spring of 1926, the Regents of the university authorized the creation of the Department of Library Science with Bishop as its chairman. Two degrees were offered: (1) a Bachelor of Arts, conferred after one year of work; and (2) a Master of Arts, conferred after two years of work. In 1930 a bachelor's degree was required for admission to the program.</p>
      <p>Bishop retired from the department chairmanship in 1940 and was succeeded by Rudolph Gjelsness. In 1948, Gjelsness led a major curriculum revision which eliminated the bachelor's degree. Hereafter, the master's degree would be awarded after two semesters and one summer of work beyond the bachelor's degree. A doctoral program was also begun.</p>
      <p>In 1964, Gjelsness reached the mandatory retirement age and was succeeded by Wallace J. Bonk. Bonk suffered a heart attack in 1967 and resigned the chairmanship to return to teaching. Professor Russell E. Bidlack, who had been a member of the faculty since 1950, was named acting chairman.</p>
      <p>In November 1967, a panel of library leaders, which had been invited to visit and examine the department, recommended that the department be made a separate school. On October 18, 1968, the Regents approved the request and the change became effective on July 1, 1969.</p>
      <p>Bidlack was named the school's first dean, a position which he held until his retirement in 1984. University Librarian Richard M. Dougherty became interim dean pending the arrival of Robert M. Warner as dean in April 1985. Warner came to the school after serving as Archivist of the United States. Under Warner, the school began to grow and change. The first visible sign of this came with the Regent's approval of the school's name change. As of July 1986, the School of Library Science officially became known as the School of Information and Library Studies. The name change reflected a changing emphasis in the curriculum and the changing nature of the field of librarianship through the use of computers and electronic media.</p>
      <p>Warner left the deanship in 1992 to resume teaching at the school. A new dean search brought Daniel E. Atkins, an engineer and computer scientist, to the school. In 1996 the school's name was again changed, this time to the School of Information. This change reflected an even greater shift away from traditional library studies and towards the use of new information technologies. In September 1998 Atkins resigned as Dean. Gary Olson served as Acting Dean until December 1999, when John L. King assumed the deanship.</p>

      <p>The records of the School of Information (formerly the School of Library Science and most recently the School of Information and Library Studies) include 42.5 linear feet of material and cover ninety seven years from 1904 to 2001. The records document the development library education at Michigan from its beginnings as summer course to a full-fledged professional program that has, in recent years moved beyond traditional library science to incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach to information studies with a strong emphasis on the role of technology in the creation, dissemination and preservation of information.</p>
      <p>The records, including correspondence, reports, committee minutes, administrative files and course descriptions, came to the library in five accessions. There is some overlap and continuation of series among the accessions.</p>
      <p>The records are organized into seven series: Histories, Office Files, Dean's Files, Audiotapes, Photographs, Faculty Meetings, and Course Material.</p>

          <p>The Office Files series constitute the central file of the School of Information. It includes internal administrative correspondence, correspondence with the university's central administration and other academic departments and with professional organizations, other library schools, foundations and accrediting agencies. The organization of the files into chronological subseries reflects the way in which the files were transferred to the archives, or in some instances, changes in school administration. There is some overlap in time span of the subseries and some continuity of files between subseries. Each of the subseries is arranged in a single alphabetical sequence</p>

            <p>The Office Files, 1904-1964 subseries (9.5 linear feet) is composed of the records of library education at the University of Michigan beginning in 1904. There are two reasons for the choice of 1964 as a dividing date. In 1964, Rudolph Gjelsness left the department after 24 years as its chairman. Secondly, the 1960s were a time of tremendous growth and change in the program, with its eventual elevation to a separate school in 1969.</p>
            <p>The 1904-1964 series is arranged alphabetically. It is largely composed of administrative correspondence. The primary correspondents are other libraries and library schools, library organizations, foundations, and other units within the university. Intra-university correspondence is located under the heading, "Michigan University." All correspondence with other library schools is located in "Library Schools." In particular, correspondence with the University of Illinois (1911-1964) and Columbia University (1926-1964) is rich. Other correspondence is scattered according to the name of the institution (i.e., American Library Association, Carnegie Endowment, and Moscow All-Union Lenin Library).</p>
            <p>Several files related to curriculum are also rich. "Curriculum Revisions and Discussions" includes documentation of the major curriculum revision of 1948. Course material is extensive and is found in three files: "Summer Sessions," "Course Material," and "Workshops." There are several folders, including correspondence, on the first formal summer session in 1909. Also of special interest are the fourteen folders of material from Bishop's seminar, L.S. 209.</p>
            <p>In addition, there is correspondence of individual faculty or administrators. The correspondence of Margaret Mann and Mary Parsons, both faculty members, is extensive. William Warner Bishop and Rudolph Gjelsness also have separate listings. However, their correspondence as department chairmen is scattered throughout the series.</p>
            <p>Other important files are Budgets (1941-1964), Faculty Meeting Minutes (1927-1964), and Annual Reports Material (1905-1916; 1932).</p>

            <p>The Office Files, 1964-1984 subseries (9 linear feet) is composed of the records of the school from 1964 through 1984, though there is very little material from Wallace Bonk's time as chairman (1964-1967). The subseries encompasses the school's administration and operation and has several interesting files.</p>
            <p>Accreditation relates to the school's reaccreditation in 1974 by the American Library Association Committee on Accreditation (COA). Prior to the COA site visit, the school undertook a self-study and submitted its report to the COA. Most of the materials relate to this self-study process. Overseen by a steering committee, chaired by Rosemary Magrill, the self-study was made up of six subcommittees: Faculty; Governance, Administration, and Financial Support; Physical Resources and Facilities; Program Goals and Objectives; Questionnaires; and Students. Each committee was made up of faculty, student, and alumni representatives. Correspondence and the final COA report are also included. The material provides detailed insight into all aspects of the school's operation.</p>
            <p>Affirmative Action contains correspondence and reports regarding the School of Library Science's efforts to meet the university's 1969 commitment to ten percent minority enrollment. There are also materials on the Black Action Movement and on an allegedly racist film ("The Speaker") purchased by the school. Alumnus-in-Residence refers to an annual program, begun in 1969, which brought distinguished alumni to the university for discussion with students about current issues in librarianship. Included in this file are programs, correspondence, and memos.</p>
            <p>The Committee on Institutional Cooperation (C.I.C.) contains correspondence regarding the development and operation of a joint doctoral program in library science. Course Material is limited for this series, with material for only three classes. Only L.S. 813, Bidlack's Trends and Issues seminar, is extensively represented. The Knapp Project contains materials about the school's experimental program in school library management from 1971 to 1974. Types of materials include grant proposals, budgets, correspondence, committee meeting notes, research data, and the interim and final reports.</p>
            <p>An especially useful file is School Status. It includes materials relating to the Regents' 1968 decision to make the Department of Library Science into a separate school. Included is Bonk's 1964 statement to Dean Haber requesting school status, and correspondence from 1963 to 1972. The largest part of the file relates to the 1967 visit by a panel of library leaders. There are numerous documents on various aspects of the department's operation.</p>
            <p>In the subseries, there are several file headings which require little description. Among these are Budgets, Faculty Minutes, and Workshops, for which there are also records in the 1904-1964 subseries. Both the Curriculum Committee and the Long-Range Planning Committee files are composed of minutes, memos, notes, and correspondence of the committees. In later accessions, Faculty Minutes are treated as a distinct series.</p>

The records in this series reflect the activities of the school. Many of the files continue previous subjects and complement the records in earlier accessions. The Accreditation files continue from the previous accession. These files provide information on the activities of the school, the curriculum, and the faculty from year to year.</p>
            <p>The Council on Library Resources (CLR) files and the Title II B files both provide information on two programs for educating and training future librarians. The CLR program focused specifically on coursework and training for students that would provide them with the background necessary for working in a college or research library. The Title II B program provided opportunities for training for minority students.</p>
            <p>The Curriculum files provide information on the courses being taught at the school and requirements for certain specialties. Types of materials found in these files include course descriptions, syllabi, and course materials, such as assignments and handouts. Also included in these files are materials on the curriculum for a School Library Media Specialist concentration. The Statistics files provide information on students, faculty and the school itself. Much of the information in these files complements that found in Dean Bidlack's files.</p>

          <p>The Dean's Files series is organized in subseries by dean. The records supplement the Office Files and also may include material on the dean's personal and professional life and activities.</p>

            <p>The Russell E. Bidlack subseries, which includes material received in several accessions, is divided into Personal and Administrative Files, Faculty Correspondence, Statistics, Topical Files and Miscellaneous Files</p>
            <p>The Personal and Administrative Files consist of correspondence, reports, lectures and speeches and professional papers. Although most of this material is personal, much of the correspondence does relate to the administration of the school. There are five major files: American Library Association (ALA); Association of American Library Schools (AALS); Consulting; Correspondence; and Lectures, Papers, Publications, Speeches, and Testimony.</p>
            <p>The ALA and AALS files consist of materials that document Bidlack's participation in various committees and projects. Listed ALA committees include: Accreditation, Professional Ethics, History Section, Nominating, Standards, and Statistics. For the AALS, the information is available on Deans and Directors, Statistics, and Tele-colloquia.</p>
            <p>Bidlack's service on the ALA Committee on Accreditation (COA) is the most extensive and best documented. There is material on Bidlack's co-writing of the COA Standards for Evaluation in 1972. There is also correspondence regarding surveys and questionnaires Bidlack sponsored on the accreditation process. The bulk of the material relates to his participation on COA visiting committees to various library schools.</p>
            <p>Consulting is a file relating to Bidlack's work as a consultant. Between 1970 and 1984, he visited and evaluated numerous library schools, assisting with accreditation and self-study. The subseries is arranged alphabetically.</p>
            <p>Correspondence is arranged both topically and chronologically. The topical portion consists primarily of correspondence with various individuals. Of particular interest here is Bidlack's frequent correspondence with Dean Edward Holley of the library school at the University of North Carolina. The letters provide insight into the problems of library school administration. The chronological files are more extensive, touching on a wide variety of subjects.</p>
            <p>Lectures, Papers, Publications, Speeches, and Testimony files contain materials relating to presentations by Bidlack. In some cases, there is correspondence in addition to the text of the presentation. This is especially the case with Bidlack's testimony before Congress and his 1979 paper, "The Place of Specialization in the Master's Degree."</p>
            <p>The Faculty Correspondence and Topical Files sub-subseries complement items found in the earlier accessions. Correspondence consists mostly of memos from Bidlack to the faculty and from the faculty to him. These provide a good source of information on the daily activities of the school and issues that were being dealt with by the faculty as a whole. The Statistics series contains statistics on every aspect of the school from number of students to break downs on faculty grade distributions. Many of these statistics were used for reports, both for university and non-university purposes.</p>

            <p>The Robert M. Warner (1 linear foot) subseries is arranged into three sub-subseries reflecting the three different aspects of his deanship, Dean Elect, 1984/85; Deanship, 1985/86-1991/92; and Graduate Library Interim Directorship, 1987/88-1990/91. The Dean Elect subseries contains correspondence and other materials pertaining to Warner's appointment as dean of the school and his plans for the Library School. The Deanship subseries contains materials relating to Warner's term as dean and his active involvement in school, university and professional activities. The Deanship files, which were received in to multiple accessions, are arranged in two alphabetical files titled Subject and Topical. One of the more well documented activities is the Information Symposium that Warner coordinated in 1991. This university-wide event brought educators together to discuss the changing nature of information and its role in modern society. In addition to documenting various administrative activities, the Warner material documents newly emerging attitudes about the future of the School and of the library profession. The strategic planning material, which includes curriculum committee reports and documents, is particularly strong in this area.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Graduate Library Interim Directorship subseries contains correspondence and other materials relating to planning and growth for the library.</p>

            <p>The Martha Pollack dean's files (2007/2008-2009/2010) subseries includes electronic records related to academic programs, admissions, enrollment, faculty searches and reviews, budgets and development, and meetings of various bodies in the school and at the university.

The records were received in a 20011 accession.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series (2 linear feet) is divided into four subseries: Class Photographs, Events, Individuals and Topical. The Events subseries includes a mixture of prints, proof sheets, and negatives. In the other three subseries, prints predominate. Arranged chronologically, the Class Photographs subseries contains group portraits (frequently identified) of students and faculty, as well as some individual student portraits from the years 1950 to 1952. The Events subseries is arranged chronologically. It consists of prints (with individuals often identified), negatives and proof sheets from a variety of conferences, lectures, ceremonies and convocations. The Individuals subseries, arranged alphabetically by surname, includes photographs of deans, faculty members, students, and alumni. The Topical subseries includes photos of campus libraries and classroom scenes. The "Unidentified" files contain a variety of shots, mostly event candids and classroom scenes. The "Small Group" photographs are undated and uncontextualized images of faculty, students and other persons. The individuals in these small group photos have been identified for the most part.</p>

          <p>The Faculty Meetings series (2.25 linear feet) includes meeting minutes, agendas, notes, and meeting attachments. The series is arranged two subseries. The first, covering the years 1927-1994, consists of the original binders of minutes, notes and related material. It is arranged in reverse chronological order with the meeting minutes maintained in the original office binder and the accompanying materials in folders directly behind the office binder. The binders often contain a subject index for the minutes. The series provides a complete record of the administrative activities of the faculty. This is particularly true until 1992. The record of minutes for 1993 and 1994 document only a few meetings. Overall, the record of the meetings serve to provide a brief summary of the school's announcements and news, enrollment figures and related discussion, budget, changes in faculty, committee activities, curriculum changes, discussion and voting on school policies and procedures, and research proposals.</p>
          <p>The second subseries, Faculty Meeting reports, 1917-1974 (.25 linear feet, accessioned in 2002) are is an addition of typewritten meeting reports and related materials that complements the main series of minutes.</p>

          <p>The Course Materials series (3 linear feet) is comprised of documentation of discontinued courses offered within the Library Science Department (L.S.) and within the School of Information and Library Studies (I.L.S.). The record of discontinued courses date from 1926 to the 1994-1995 school year. The office procedure was to establish a folder for each course in the school's record keeping system. Each course folder contains a wealth of information. Documentation on the courses may include a copy of the official record of course change (Office of Registration received the original), course description, instructor, course syllabi, examination questions, course assignments, and student reports. Student reports are found mainly for those courses taught in the Library Science Department. The series will be immensely useful for a researcher interested in studying the change in the school's curriculum from one focused on book cataloging and library management to one centered on information management within a wide variety of environments and institutions. The Course Materials are divided into two subseries, 1926-1965 and 1935-1995, reflecting the manner in which the files were received.</p>
