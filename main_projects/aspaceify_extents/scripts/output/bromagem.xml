    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Mary C. Bromage was born on October 13, 1906 in Massachusetts to James J. and Sarah Edith Ives Cogan. She attended public high school in Wakefield and Peabody, Massachusetts from 1920 through 1924. From 1924 to 1925, Bromage worked as a reporter for two Boston newspapers. During this same time, she was enrolled at Radcliffe College, earning her bachelor of arts degree (summa cum laude) in 1928. Her fields of concentration for her bachelor's degree included English literature, American and European government, world history, philosophy, Latin, French and German. Upon graduation, she married Arthur Watson Bromage (see separate Arthur Bromage finding aid). She continued her education at the University of Michigan, receiving her master's degree in 1932. The topic of her master's thesis was a comparative analysis of the treatment of Irish history in the medieval period.</p>
      <p>In addition to her personal scholarly interests and family obligations, Mary Bromage continually took on other responsibilities. She was chief administrative officer for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Washington, D.C from 1943 to 1944 and acting Dean of Women at the University of Michigan from 1944 to 1950. She was chief editorial writer for the <title render="italic">Ann Arbor News</title> from 1950 to 1955 and from 1954 to 1974 she was a lecturer in the English Department and professor in the School of Business Administration at the University of Michigan. Bromage was an author and Professor Emerita of Written Communication at the School of Business Administration at the University of Michigan. She also taught written communication for national business firms and government agencies. She instructed executives on clear writing and communication with employees. She conducted workshops and seminars in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Far East, Latin America and Africa.</p>
      <p>Mary Bromage received many awards throughout her life. As a result of her editorials in the <title render="italic">Ann Arbor News</title>, the Freedom Foundation of Valley Forge awarded her its "certificate of recognition in bringing about a better understanding of the American way of life." The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Graduate School selected her to receive its annual "award of merit" and its award as "the most outstanding instructor at the Center," electing her to its Hall of Fame. In 1974, she was designated an Outstanding Educator of America. The U.S. Army Audit Agency also awarded her a Certificate of Appreciation. In 1991, the National Guard presented her with its medal for "outstanding support." In 1992, the Postal Inspection Service presented her with a special award in recognition of her "valuable contributions."</p>
      <p>Much of her focus in her published writings was on Ireland and written communication. Bromage's book <title render="italic">DeValera and the March of a Nation</title> (1956, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1967) was published in Great Britain and the United States. Other books she had published were <title render="italic">Cases in Written Communication</title> (1964 and 1971), <title render="italic">Churchill and Ireland</title> (1964), <title render="italic">Writing for Business</title> (1971) and <title render="italic">Writing Audit Reports</title> (1979 and 1984 in Spanish). Many professional and academic journals have carried her articles on Irish nationalism as well as on written communication and writing audit reports.</p>
      <p>She both participated in television and radio programs and wrote about topics of interest. Bromage was a host for University of Michigan television programs between 1954 and 1955 and a participant in 1974 and 1977. She was also involved in several radio programs involving Ireland and communications.</p>
      <p>Bromage spent much of her time traveling outside the United States for research and lectures. She was a resident in Dublin, Ireland from 1936 through 1937. She spent time traveling in Great Britain, continental Europe, Korea, Japan, and Russia.</p>
      <p>She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Women of the University Faculty, League of Women Voters, Midwest Case Research Association, American Committee on Irish Studies, Conference on British Studies, and the University of Michigan Research Club. She was appointed to the board of the University's Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations. She received the Citation of Honor from the Regents of the University of Michigan for her "notable career" as an author and teacher and for her "contributions to the academic leadership of the University."</p>
      <p>She and her husband Arthur had one daughter, Susanna Bromage Paterson, six grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. Mary Bromage died on January 3, 1995 at her daughter's home in Berkeley, California. She had been preceded in death by her husband, Arthur Bromage.</p>
