      <abstract>D. C. Allen was a Three Oaks, Michigan book dealer and collector of material on the House of David, an adventist cult founded in England. The leader of this cult was Benjamin Purnell who made Benton Harbor his home and the site of his follower’s business activities. The Allen collection (formerly housed at the Wyoming American Heritage Center) consists of most of the publications by and about the Israelite House of David, scattered manuscript materials mainly documenting the colony's business operations and court cases involving Purnell and the colony, and photographs and postcards depicting activities of the colony.</abstract>

        <p>D. C. Allen was a Three Oaks, Michigan book dealer, bibliographer, and collector of all kinds of materials relating to the House of David colony in Berrien Springs. Allen had the bookman's keen interest in the publications of Benjamin Purnell, the House of David, and the preceding Adventist messengers. For his catalog, Allen researched each pamphlet, monograph, and tract, creating note cards with information on publishing history and the importance of the item to House of David history. Allen sold his collection to the American Heritage Center in 1980 who subsequently transferred it to the Bentley Historical Library in 2005 when it was determined to be out-of-scope.</p>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The Israelite House of David was established at Benton Harbor, Michigan, in 1903 by "King Benjamin" Purnell, a former roving preacher, and his wife Mary. In 1895, Purnell received a revelation that he was the "seventh messenger" described in the Book of Revelation. The previous six "angels" were Joanna Southcott, Richard Brothers, George Turner, William Shaw, John Wroe, and James Jezreel, all of England. As outlined in biblical scripture, the function of the seventh angel was to gather together the tribes of Israel prior to the second coming of Christ.</p>
      <p>Incorporated under a religious charter, the Israelite House of David was a commonwealth with all possessions of members surrendered to Purnell who in turn provided for their support from a central fund which he administered. Most of the original members of the colony came from Indiana and Ohio, but this number increased dramatically following a trip to Australia in 1904-05 when Purnell appeared before the members of the previous messenger's followers, James Jezreel. During its heyday in the 1920s, the Benton Harbor colony numbered more than 900 members.</p>
      <p>Activities of the colony included a farm, numerous commercial ventures including an amusement park, an open air tabernacle, a vegetarian restaurant, hotel, bands, crafts for sale in a gift shop, and a printing press. The colony was also remembered for its traveling baseball team with players' trademark braided long hair and beards.</p>
      <p>Almost from its inception the colony and Purnell were the subject of both controversy and litigation. In 1923, some members of the colony brought suit against Purnell for the restitution of their property and wages for the time they had worked without pay. In another case, the people of the state of Michigan questioned the colony's tax exempt status for its many commercial ventures. Most damaging, Purnell was the subject of several morals charges. Just days before his death in December 1927, an order was issued to him to vacate the House of David premises and to dissolve the religious association.</p>
      <p>Internal power struggles which began before Purnell's death culminated in a split in 1930 and the formation of a new colony, the Israelite House of David as Re-organized by Mary Purnell, later shortened to Mary's City of David, led by Purnell's widow Mary. The original colony which had earlier shortened its name to the House of David was led by Judge H. T. Dewhirst, the colony's chief secretary. In 1966, membership in the House of David numbered under 100, though some operations continued, such as the miniature train locomotive. The aging membership was still devout in their expectation of the imminent second coming.</p>

          <p>The Publications, divided into several series, contains Allen's collection of books, pamphlets, and periodicals published by the House of David and by Mary's City of David. Also included are works about the House of David and publications by and about Joanna Southcott and the other Messengers preceding Benjamin Purnell in the House of David's understanding. The collection also includes a few other works, mainly dealing with esoteric knowledge, for which the connection to the House of David is unclear. For the ease of researchers, all other works in the Bentley Library's collection relating to the House of David have also been included in this inventory.</p>
          <p>Allen kept detailed notes on the sometimes confusing publication history of the House of David and City of David. His notecards are available in the Bentley Library Reading Room card file. Portions of his notes directly relating to editions and printings have been excerpted in this inventory. The cards often include additional information about the significance and meaning of the texts.</p>
          <p>The publications series is organized by publisher or subject: Publications of the House of David (sometimes called the Israelite House of David, including both the organization led by Mary and Benjamin Purnell before 1929 and the succeeding organization led by Judge Dewhirst after the split); Publications of Mary's City of David (initially known as the Israelite House of David as reorganized by Mary Purnell); Writings about the House of David and City of David; Publications by and about the six predecessor Messengers, Joanna Southcott, Richard Brothers, George Turner, William Shaw (no publications), John Wroe and the Society of Christian Israelites, and James Jezreel and the New and Latter House of Israel; Publications of Helen Barltrop (and the Panacea Society) and British Israelism (successors to Joanna Southcott not directly related to the House of David); Publications of Richard W. Hill (a follower and interpreter of Benjamin Purnell); Esoteric and other writings of uncertain connection with the House of David or other Southcottian prophets.</p>
          <p>Within each category, all titles are arranged in this inventory alphabetically by title. More substantial bound volumes are not located in the manuscript boxes, but should be retrieved by the call numbers listed for them.</p>

              <p>(BHL note: <title render="italic">The Book of wisdom</title> was issued first as a single volume of 64 pages in 1904. The BHL collection does not include a copy of the 1904 volume. The book was Expanded to four volumes of 64 pages in 1905. The BHL collections includes only books two and three. In 1908 the fire in the print shop destroyed the stock and plates. The set then was revised to 100 pages and extended to five volumes. In 1912 the set was further expanded to its final form with the printing of the sixth and seventh volumes. In its final form the first six volumes contain a prefatory message titled "Images and likenesses" signed by Mary and Benjamin. After the division in 1930 those copies remaining in stock were subjected to a symbolic erasure of Mary's name.)</p>

A third issue varies from the second only in that the reference to title being registered has been deleted from the plate. The 2nd edition, although bearing the 1915 date, was reissued shortly after the printing of the last four volumes of the set (ca. 1930). The "Star of Bethlehem" is still offered for sale in the literature list. The wraps are of a deeper green color and of stiff, grained paper and are printed in black ink. The paper is coated stock.)</p>

              <p>(Allen annotation: 1st edition. There are four issues or impressions of the 1st edition in all. The work was printed from plates with wrapper printed in white ink from type. There are variations in the type used to print the wrapper. By checking the literature list at the back of the volumes the conclusion is the 1st impression was on pulp paper, the 2nd impression was on coated stock, the 3rd on pulp and the 4th on coated stock. The four impressions were issued over the period 1916-1925. 2nd edition. Although bearing the 1916 date the 2nd edition, 1st impression was issued shortly before printing of the last four volumes of the set in 1925. The paper is of a better quality and the wraps are still of stiff mottled rose paper. The printing on the wrap is in black ink. A 2nd impression was issued after 1925 with the literature list offering all six volumes of the Ball of fire. 3rd edition. The wraps are of red leather grained paper. The frontis portrait is of the type used in the last four volumes of the Ball of fire. There is no literature list in this edition. There is sufficient internal evidence to qualify this as a distinct edition.)</p>

              <p>[Allen annotation: This, the first of Benjamin's divine writings was also the principal document, the charter of faith and discipline of the Seventh Church. The size of the edition is not known but quite likely did not exceed 500 sets. A large percentage of the first edition was sent to the followers of John Wroe in Australia and to the followers of the Jezreel Church in England. The balance of the edition no doubt going quickly to the various followers in the United States and Canada. A second edition was printed at Benton Harbor immediately after establishing their printing office in 1903. Of this second edition a quantity were burned along with the plates for printing in the fire that destroyed the printing office in the winter of 1907-1908. In the late fall of 1910 the following announcement appeared in "Shiloh's messenger of wisdom" "on account of many printers' errors in the first edition of the Star, which in many placed changed the original meaning, it was necessary that it be revised and these errors corrected. We have been busily engaged on this winter and announce that the first volume of the Star of Bethlehem, the corrected edition, is ready to be sent out to those who are ready to receive same."</p>
              <p>"Many changes of things written pertaining to the two Old Houses has been taken out and replaced with later writings pertaining more to the present time. Therefore we wish to ask all those who are in possession of the old Star, having paid for same, to kindly return them to headquarters and we shall exchange the new Star for them which will be sent to you immediately upon receipt of the old Star." This request for the return of the first (and second) editions of the Star was apparently honored almost without exception as only a single surviving set has been located ant that in the files of the House of David.</p>
              <p>The Star was not distributed indiscriminately and was available to "Israel only." Prospective converts were expected to study the introductory works and the Seven books of wisdom then, upon showing evidence of their faith the Star of Bethlehem was supplied. During the 1927 trial the state attacked the Star charging that it taught perjury to the membership. Fearing that the state might confiscate and destroy their most precious book, many copies were hidden.</p>
              <p>After the trial and the death of Benjamin many copies were destroyed by members who "lost faith," or, feeling that Mary had some part in writing the Star they destroyed them during the difficulties prior to the separation when feeling against her ran high. Wm. Barnard, as attorney for Mary and a portion of the membership recommended to the Michigan Supreme Court that the so called perjury books be destroyed ant that the objectionable portions of the Star be deleted. In the edition printed later by Mary's City of David these portions no longer appear in the work and it was again distributed on the same restricted basis as formerly. The old House of David did not reissue the work and no longer distributed it at all. All mention of the Star was removed from the literature lists and as far as the public was concerned it no longer existed.]</p>

                <p>[Allen annotation: 2nd edition. The 1st edition of the third Comforter, printed at the old Colony was recalled and ordered destroyed by Benjamin. Doubtless some of Mary's faction did not turn in their copies but at the present time it has not been possible to locate and compare a copy with the second edition. Benjamin is said to have referred to the original work as "one hundred forty-four pages and one hundred forty-four delusions." The present edition contains 150 pages of larger format than used on the House of David editions of the Comforters suggesting that considerable addition and changes May have been made in the 2nd edition.]</p>

Until it was discovered that Judge Dewhirst had refused Mary the use of the colony print shop to print her fourth "Comforter" and that she therefore had six typewritten copies of her manuscript made and bound up for circulation among her followers, the existence of a first edition was doubtful. Mary considered these six copies as a legitimate edition and thus indicated on the title page of the City of David printing its status as the 2nd edition.]</p>

          <p>The Manuscripts series is small and represents but a fragment of the papers and records that once might have been maintained by the people of the colony relating to their beliefs and to their business activities. Of greatest interest perhaps are those documents (briefs, testimony, and transcripts) relating to the various legal suits against Benjamin Purnell and the Israelite House of David in the 1920s. There is also fragmentary correspondence, some of which relates to the scheduling of the traveling House of David baseball team. This portion of the collection also includes clippings and other written materials about the colony, and miscellaneous items, such as calendars, business forms, menus, programs, and related items, which provide a sense of the economic enterprises of the colony.</p>

          <p>Researchers interested in images related to the House of David are advised to begin with Photographs and Post Cards, the most inclusive and most easily physically examined subseries of Visual Materials. Most of the images in the Negatives and Slide subseries are duplicative of images in these first two. Effort has been made to identify those items that are available in this collection only in negative or slide format, so that the researcher may better determine when physically reviewing those items may be useful. Researchers who are interested in additional information about an image, especially dates or names of individuals in the image, will often find that information written on the back of the photographic print or, where available, written in pencil on the negative image.</p>
