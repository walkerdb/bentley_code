      <p>The Office of Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Affairs (LGBTA) was created in 1971 as the Human Sexuality Office within the Office of Special Services and Programs of the University of Michigan. Initially heading the office were two individuals, a lesbian advocate and a gay male advocate, each of them temporary and part-time. A year later the advocate positions were upgraded to permanent and professional level, but they were still only funded at one-quarter time. Five years later the advocates became funded at one-half time through the efforts of concerned university and community members. In 1980, the office was taken out of the Office of Special Services and Programs and brought under the supervision of the Director of Counseling Services. At this same time, the term advocate was dropped and in its place the position of program coordinator established. By the late 1980s the co-coordinator positions were made full-time. In 1994, the office ceased having two individuals in charge (one for lesbians and one for gay males) and a single director headed the program. Ronni Sanlo served as the first director. It was also at this time that James W. Toy resigned as Gay Male Advocate. Toy was instrumental in the establishment of the office and had served as the Gay Male Advocate for twenty-three years. Over the years, the program has changed its name several times, from the Human Sexuality Office to the Lesbian-Gay Male Programs Office (LGMPO), to the Lesbian-Gay Male-Bisexual Programs Office, to its current title. The office is administratively located within the office of the Associate Dean of Students in the Office of Students Affairs.</p>
      <p>As the first such university office established in the United States, the Human Sexuality Office had no models to emulate. The diverse program created by the two advocates was intended to meet specific needs and concerns. From the beginning education, peer advising and counseling, gay rights advocacy, and community organization were the primary concerns of the Human Sexuality Office. Throughout the history of the office, the advocates sought to educate the university community to dispel myths and stereotypes about gay life. Through classroom presentations, appearances at seminars and conferences, both within and outside the university environment, and consciousness-raising sessions for university units, the office sought to promote an open and supportive environment at the university. The popularity and demand for such presentations soon overwhelmed the advocates and they began a program to train volunteers or facilitators who would go around to the various classes. This emphasis of was designated the Educational Outreach Program and was eventually headed, beginning in 1982, by paid coordinators. Additionally, LGMPO served as a clearinghouse where gay men and lesbians could go for information about gay life and activities.</p>
      <p>The counseling program of the office consisted of peer and professional counseling and peer counselor and group facilitator training. The advocates were able to provide short- and long-term professional counseling for individuals, couples, and groups. For a time, the office became home to a 24-hour "Gay Hotline" operated by members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and funded privately by the GLF and others. The Hotline served those individuals, sometimes troubled, who needed to talk with someone of a similar sexual orientation or who could be referred to an appropriate organization or individual with specialized professional training.</p>
      <p>Gay rights advocacy was a core mission of the office. Beginning in 1972, one of the important aims of the advocates was working towards an amendment of Regents Bylaw 14.06 to prohibit discrimination within the university community based on sexual orientation. Much of the first public demonstration to revise 14.06 was done by the Gay Liberation Front and then in the 1980s by a student group known as LaGROC (Lesbian and Gay Rights on Campus). Using sit-ins and other non-violent demonstrations, LaGROC dramatized the importance of revising the bylaw. In 1984, pressure from LaGROC was primarily responsible for President Harold Shapiro issuing a Presidential Policy on non-discrimination. Although sexual orientation was still not included as part of 14.06 (the Bylaw was eventually changed in September 1993), the presidential statement was a partial victory for LaGROC, and led to the establishment of the President's Task Force on Sexual Orientation that was intended to oversee the implementation of the Presidential Policy.</p>
      <p>The office celebrated its thirtieth anniversary (Fall 2002) under the direction of Frederic MacDonald-Dennis. The office offers a variety of educational and training opportunities, events, as well as resources housed in the Jim Toy Library and Resource Center.</p>

      <p>The records of the Office of Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Affairs (LGBTA) document the activities of the Office from 1976 to 2001, but mainly cover the period from 1989 to 1997. For earlier records of the office see the Lesbian-Gay Male-Bisexual Programs Office series within the James W. Toy collection, which is also held at the Bentley Library. Note that there is some overlap between the records in the Toy collection and this record group.</p>
      <p>The record group contain correspondence including electronic mail printouts, memoranda, clippings, educational training manuals, photographic, and audio and visual materials. The records are organized in three series: Administrative Files, Topical Files and Audio-Visual Material.</p>

            <p>The series Administrative Files, 1987-1999 (2 linear feet) is divided into two subseries: Executive Files and Office Files. The executive files contain correspondence and other material created or directed to the office co-coordinator, Billie Edwards or after 1994 to the Director, Ronni Sanlo.

The Office Files subseries contains general office correspondence ca. 1991-1997, staff meeting minutes and agendas, material related to the President's New Century Fund Award for Diversity for work on the report "From Invisibility to Inclusion" project, and a number of files related to the Task Force on Sexual Orientation. The task force materials range in date from 1987 to 1991. Note that the James W. Toy collection, boxes 8 and 9, also contains material related to the Task Force on Sexual Orientation.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series, 1976-2001 (1.75 linear feet) contains a number of folders arranged by subject relating to human sexuality and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights activities. This series includes background materials on housing issues at the university, same-sex benefits, and printouts of the LGBTA online newsletter from the years 1995 to 1997. The series includes an office clippings file ca. 1989-1999 that is arranged by coverage at the university, within Ann Arbor, and within the State of Michigan. The series also contains a small amount of material related to the Educational Outreach Program dating from the early 1990s.

          <p>The Audio-Visual Material series, 1987-2001 (1.25 linear feet), is comprised of audio recordings, photographs, posters, and video recordings. The thirty audio recordings include copies of the WCBN broadcasts of the Gay/Lesbian Radio Collective Show. The broadcasts date from the 1987-1988 time period. Other audio recordings include the <title render="italic">March on Washington</title>, October 13, 1987 and <title render="italic">Coming Out Stories</title>, dated October 20 and 27, 1987. The photographs are mainly 4 x 6 prints. Unfortunately, most of the photographs are unidentified and the majority are undated. The posters include twelve posters used to showcase office events on campus. The posters are largely undated. The video recordings include two VHS tapes. The video recordings include a taping of an Ann Arbor City Council Meeting held on November 4, 1991, that discusses the Domestic Partnership Ordinance, and "The African-American Lesbian Experience: A Personal and Historical Perspective." The latter recording was taped as part of the 1994 Martin Luther King, Jr. Symposium held at the University of Michigan.</p>
