      <p>Programs for Educational Opportunity (PEO) is a race desegregation assistance center based at the University of Michigan and originally funded under Title IV of the 1964 Federal Civil Rights Act. PEO was established in 1970 under the directorship of Charles Moody and provided services to Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. PEO serves as the umbrella agency for the Project for Fair Administration of School Discipline (PFASD), which was originally funded under Title VII--Emergency School Aid, Special Student Concerns Projects--and evaluates and aids midwestern school districts in eradicating incommensurate discipline of minority students. Since its inception, PEO has provided assistance to over three thousand school districts, and in-depth technical assistance to over one hundred school districts.</p>
      <p>PEO and PFASD have served Michigan school districts in the transition period following the passing of the Civil Rights Act until the present. According to a grant proposal narrative, PEO was founded to aid both schools and students by a focus not on desegregation, but on integration to attain equality of opportunity. Furthermore, PEO and PFASD existed to address discriminatory student assignment, inequitable discipline, unrepresentative student participation, unequal counseling, discriminatory employment practices, biased curriculum, classroom segregation, interracial conflict, and community hostility toward desegregation. PEO and PFASD have supported schools seeking these goals in a number of ways. In partnership, they have conducted local, regional, and national in-service training and conferences for school districts on many topics such as human relations training, recruiting minority staff, combating racism and sexism in the curriculum, student rights and discipline, and the development of staff counseling skills. A number of reports have been issued which detail the history of desegregation in the Ann Arbor, Detroit, Ferndale, Grand Rapids, Highland Park, and Kalamazoo school districts.</p>
      <p>PFASD also issued a number of reports both general and specific to school districts in the evaluation of schools in the equity of discipline among students. School districts were ranked at different levels within Local Education Agencies (LEAs); each district was assigned a case worker from PEO/PFASD who visited the schools on numerous occasions and reported their findings in field activities reports. Many such field activity reports were utilized to create both general and specific case studies which were then distributed to schools and/or delivered at conferences and in-service training.</p>
      <p>PEO is now a combined Race, Gender, and National Origin Desegregation Assistance Center. The Gender Center began in 1981 and the National Origin Center in 1987. In 1988, the name was changed from the Program for Educational Opportunity to the Programs for Educational Opportunity to reflect the wider scope of its efforts. One grant currently funds all three aspects of PEO--race, gender, and national origin--and is subject to renewal every three years. While the program exists within the School of Education, there is no direct funding from the University of Michigan, nor any direct involvement by education faculty. Charles Moody remained director until 1987 when he was appointed University of Michigan Vice Provost for Minority Affairs. Upon his appointment, Percy Bates assumed directorship of the program.</p>

      <p>The records for the Program for Educational Opportunity are divided into ten series: Administrative, Correspondence, Committees and Task Forces, Conferences and Workshops, Handbooks, Reports, Desegregation, PFASD, Public Schools, and Topical Files. All folders within series are arranged alphabetically. Researchers of desegregation efforts and the controversy of school discipline will find many valuable resources in the record group such as research reports, case studies, and conference materials. Also well documented is the Ann Arbor Area School District within the general Public Schools series which includes information on various programs within the district, records from the Board of Education, community surveys, and statistical data on staff and students. The Conferences and Workshops and Committees and Task Forces are also series that are particularly well documented; included are conference and workshop materials, reports, and in some cases, evaluations.</p>

          <p>The Conferences and Workshops series (1.75 feet) covers 1971-1983 and is one of the largest series within the collection. It includes not only planning materials for conferences, but also the reports both generated and, in some cases, presented at conferences and workshops. Papers presented by PEO director Charles Moody appear at the end of the series prior to Workshops. A virtually comprehensive index to conferences between 1971-1977 is located at the beginning of the series, in addition to conference evaluation results from 1973-1974. Information on workshops includes in-service training and special school presentation materials. Planning materials and handouts are included. Conferences and workshops were geared mainly towards educators and focused on many issues such as bicultural education, humanistic education, developing counseling skills, diversity in educational opportunities, and student suspensions and discipline. Conferences and workshops are arranged alphabetically by title. Workshop information follows conference materials.</p>

Included are manuals on conference planning, implementing a multi-cultural curriculum, and inter-cultural approaches to a multi-cultural education. Administration, Desegregation and PFASD manuals can be located within those series.</p>

          <p>The Reports series (.5 feet) covers ca. 1975-ca. 1982, and is small in size as it constitutes only general reports. Researchers should note the existence of specialized reports in other series, such as Desegregation and PFASD. Reports in this series are general in nature with the exception of the proposal for a race desegregation center. Other report titles include "Approaches to Equity" and "Cultural Encounters: Some Truths about the Melting Pot."</p>

          <p>The Desegregation series (1 foot) covers 1972-1981, and is divided into public schools, and contains reports specific to those schools. Histories of desegregation efforts from 1954 to 1979 within many schools are included in addition to a small amount of school-specific desegregation proposal and resource materials. Detroit is particularly well represented by a lengthy "Battle to Desegregate Detroit's Schools, 1954-1979." Following the public schools are three general folders on desegregation: "Planning Handbook," "Status of Desegregation in Michigan," and a topical information packet.</p>

          <p>The Project for the Fair Administration of School Discipline (PFASD) series (3.5 feet) covers the years 1974-1980. It contains administrative meeting minutes, reference and training manuals, and papers concerning public schools. School-specific reports and many schools' codes of behavior and rights statements are included in this series. Ann Arbor is not particularly well represented in this series; Lansing, Buena Vista, and Detroit are the best represented schools. Following the breakdown of materials by school are general papers of PFASD. Included is the original proposal for the establishment of PFASD, and research reports and implementation plans of PFASD. Concluding the series is information on PFASD-specific workshops. The largest amount of materials concerning workshops concerns "Building Class Rules."</p>

          <p>The Public Schools series (2.25 feet) covers the years 1978-1980. The series contains varied information on specific schools. Researchers should note the existence of specific information on public schools in other series such as Desegregation and PFASD. A large amount of material in the Public Schools series focuses on Ann Arbor. School-specific task forces, surveys, reports, committees, and correspondence are included within Ann Arbor, while the rest of the series contains only year end reports of schools.</p>

          <p>Public Schools (2 linear ft) is a large series which spans the years 1976-1990. The series contains information on the assistance provided to school districts mostly in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. The series contains material regarding both the CSES and the race desegregation efforts of PEO. Some school districts participated in both programs while others participated in just one or the other. The series consists largely of year end reports and some correspondence.</p>

The series is arranged alphabetically and spans the period 1981-2002, but most reports are from the years 1994-2002.</p>

          <p>The Center for Sex Equity in Schools (CSES) series (.5 linear feet) contains reports, manuals, correspondence, and minutes concerning that organization's programs and initiatives during the years 1980-2000. There are several documents about "Comparable Worth" studies, an effort to define a single, bias-free, job evaluation system which could be used to eliminate gender-defined wage gaps. The series also includes minutes from meetings of the District Network, a forum for school administrators in the Great Lakes region to discuss issues related to sex equity. Researchers who consult this series are advised to consult boxes 13 and 14, which contain earlier records of this organization.</p>
