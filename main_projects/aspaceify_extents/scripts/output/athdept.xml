      <p>The University of Michigan Athletic Department manages the university's participation in intercollegiate athletic competition.  The department is governed by the Board in Control of  Intercollegiate Athletics and headed by the Athletic Director.  Since 1973 the department has managed women's intercollegiate athletics.  Sub-units of the department include offices for each varsity sport, Sports Information, and various administrative and support offices.</p>
      <p>The first organized  athletic activity at the University of Michigan was sponsored by the "Pioneer Cricket Club" formed by students in 1860.  In 1865, the university appropriated  fifty dollars for the maintenance of a playing field, the first official recognition and support for student athletics.  Prior to 1873 athletic competition was managed by informal student clubs that had no official standing with the university.  Baseball, football, and boating clubs organized occasional competitions with the local high school or area community teams.   In  1873 a Football Association was formed and a Baseball Association in 1876.  The two merged in  1878 to form the first Athletic Association.  This was a completely student controlled organization  seeking to direct the activities of the university athletic teams with the aim of raising funds for construction of a gymnasium.  In addition to modest gate receipts from games, the Athletic Association sponsored dances and other social events as fund-raisers.  The Athletic Association dissolved in 1884 and the management of athletics reverted to the individual sports clubs, including a track club originally formed in 1874.</p>
      <p>In 1890/91 the University of Michigan Athletic Association was formed.  According to its constitution, any student could become a member by paying the annual fee of three dollars, making him a participant in the management of  university athletics.  The Association elected managers for each sport who were scheduled games an handled other administrative matters.  In 1891 the Athletic Association hired Frank Crawford as the first football coach.</p>
      <p>The Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics was formed in 1893 to assert a measure of faculty control over athletics.  It assumed overall responsibility for athletic policy and financial management, but the student Athletic Association  continued to play a role in athletics until 1920. The board originally consisted of  nine members; five chosen from the faculty senate by President Angell and four undergraduates, at first selected by the Board of Directors of the Athletic Association but later chosen by the student body.</p>
      <p>A desire to regularize competition with other Midwestern universities led the Athletic Association to join Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Northwestern in forming the Northwestern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1893.  The league sponsored competition in baseball and track but folded after one year.  The Western Intercollegiate Athletic Association was formed in the fall of 1894 and sponsored a  track meet the following spring.  In 1896  Dr. C.B.G. de Nancrede and Professor Albert Pattengill joined  representatives of  Wisconsin, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois and Northwestern who met in Chicago to form the Intercollegiate Conference of  Faculty Representatives, commonly referred to then as the "Western Conference" and now as the Big Ten.  Indiana and Iowa joined the conference in 1899 and Ohio State in 1912.  The University of Chicago left the conference in 1939/40 and Michigan State joined in 1950.</p>
      <p>Charles Baird was appointed "Director of Outdoor Athletics" under the Board in Control in 1899.  Baird had been an officer of the Athletic Association as an undergraduate and later held the title of "Graduate Director of  Athletics."  Baird is considered to be the first Athletic Director.  He was responsible for hiring Fielding Yost as football coach in 1901.  Baird served as Director of Outdoor Athletics  until 1908.  He was succeeded by Philip Bartelme, who had attended the university in 1855-96 and 1897-98.  He held the post through 1920.</p>
      <p>In 1907 Michigan withdrew from  the Western Conference over a dispute on reform measures originally proposed by President Angell.  Michigan remained outside the conference until 1918.  During this period the Board in Control was reorganized several times as different factions of  the faculty, student body, administration, and  alumni sought influence on the question of rejoining the conference.</p>
      <p>Fielding Yost was appointed Director of Intercollegiate Athletics in 1921.  At the same time Dr. John Sundwall was named chairman of the Department of  Physical Education, Athletics and School Health leading to conflict with Yost over control of athletic administration.  In 1926 acting university president Alfred Lloyd  appointed Edmund Day, dean of
the Business School, to head a Senate committee to investigate the athletic situation on campus.  The resulting "Day Report" was a far ranging document that led to significant changes in athletic administration, programs and facilities.  Considered the foundation document of the modern athletic department, the "Day Report" adopted much of Yost's program of "Athletics For All" and resulted in the construction of Michigan
Stadium, the Intramural Sports Building, the University Golf Course, and facilities for women's athletics at Palmer Field.</p>
      <p>In 1925 Yost hired Philip C. Pack as the department's first "publicity agent" laying the groundwork for the modern Sports Information Office.  Pack was succeeded by Frank DeLano in 1940 and Les Etter in 1943.  Yost retired as  Athletic Director in 1941 and was succeeded by football coach Herbert. O. "Fritz" Crisler, who also assumed responsibility for the intramural and physical education programs. Crisler retired as football coach following the 1947 season, but continued  as Athletic Director until 1968.  Crisler oversaw a further expansion of the athletic department's physical plant, including two expansions of Michigan Stadium,  a varsity pool, a women's  swimming pool, the Athletic Office Building (now Weidenbach Hall), modern baseball stands, and the University Events Building - later named Crisler Arena.</p>
      <p>Crisler was succeeded by track coach Don Canham who initiated aggressive marketing and promotional campaigns that made Michigan a pioneer in the development  of merchandising and licensing agreements as sources of revenue.  Canham's tenure saw the inauguration of varsity competition for women.  In 1972 Congress  passed Title IX of the  Education Amendment Act prohibiting sexual discrimination in education programs which received federal funding.  The Department of Health Education and Welfare and the courts interpreted this to mean schools must provide equal athletic opportunities for  men and women students. In response to Title IX and complaints from women students,  university  president Robben Fleming created a Committee to Study Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, headed by Eunice Burns, an Ann Arbor political and social activist and later assistant dean in the School of Education.  On the basis of the "Burns Committee" report, varsity level competition in seven sports was instituted in 1973/74.  Marie Hartwig was appointed Associate Director of Women's Intercollegiate Athletics, reporting to the Athletic Director.  Hartwig retired in 1976 and was succeeded by Virginia Hunt who served less than one year.  Phyllis Ocker assumed the post in 1977. Ocker was succeeded by Peggy Bradley-Doppes in 1991.  In the course of several reorganizations of the department in the 1990s aimed at fully integrating administration of the men's and women's programs the separate position of Director of Women's Intercollegiate Athletics was eliminated.</p>
      <p>From 1973 to 1981 women's sports at Michigan operated under the rules of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), a national association that tried to provide women's athletics  an alternative to the National Collegiate Athletic Association which governed men's sports.   Michigan's women's teams competed in two associations affiliated with the AIAW; the Midwest Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women and the State of Michigan Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women.  In 1981 women's sports left the governing structure of the AIAW to join the  NCAA and began competing in the Big Ten conference.</p>
      <p>Canham retired in 1989 and was succeeded by football coach Glen E. "Bo" Schembechler, 1989-1990; Jack Weidenbach, 1990-1994; and Joe Roberson, 1994-1997.  Thomas Goss was named athletic director in Sept. 1997 and was succeeded by Bill Martin in 2000.</p>
      <p>Michigan now offers varsity competition in 26 sports.  The recent media guides contain capsule histories for each sport.  The first years of varsity level intercollegiate for  UM sports are :</p>

      <p>The  Athletic Department now manages an extensive complex of indoor and outdoor facilities. The first athletic competitions and practices were held on central campus, approximately where the Chemistry building now stands, and at the Fair Grounds (now Burns Park).   In 1890 the Board of Regents appropriated $3000 for the purchase of  land on South State Street for use as a playing field for football, baseball, and track.  Regents  Field opened in 1893 with a single covered bleacher accommodating  400.  The original bleachers, which stood approximately where Schembechler Hall is today,  burned in 1895 and were replaced with covered bleachers seating 800.  Later additions of permanent bleachers and temporary stands increased capacity to 17,000.  Regents Field was the site of UM football games through the 1906 season.</p>
      <p>In 1902 Dexter Ferry donated a tract of land north of Regents Field for development of new athletic facilities. The entire athletic complex was renamed Ferry Field.  Construction of  a new football field, on the site of the current running track,  was completed in 1906.  The new Ferry Field seated 18,000 fans.  Replacement of the south stands with concrete bleachers in 1914 increased capacity to 25,000.  Construction of permanent wooden bleachers in the end zones expanded seating to 41,000.</p>
      <p>A "club house" was built at the east end of Ferry Field in 1912, providing a  locker room for the football team and offices for the coaches. (It now houses the ticket office, Sports Information, and  administrative offices.)</p>
      <p>Michigan Stadium was completed in 1927 with permanent seating of 72,000 and temporary wooden bleachers for a total capacity of 84,400.  In 1949 the wooden bleachers were replaced with permanent steel bleachers, raising capacity to 97,239.  Additional bleachers were added in 1956 increasing seating to 101,000.  Artificial Tartan Turf was installed in 1969 and replaced with All Pro artificial turf in 1983.  A grass playing surface was reinstalled in 1991.  The replacement of the remaining original redwood seats with metal and reconfiguring of seat numbers in 1992 added 800 seats bringing the official capacity to 102,501. The addition of five rows of seats to the top of the stadium in 1998 raised capacity to 107,501</p>
      <p>Football facilities also include Oosterbaan Field House, an indoor practice area and Schembechler Hall,  with locker room, weight training, and physical therapy facilities, as well as coaches' and administrative offices.   Schembechler Hall also houses the Margaret Dow Towsley Museum featuring historical displays and sports memorabilia.</p>
      <p>Waterman Gymnasium (now the site of the Chemistry Building) was completed in 1894.  In addition to serving as the site for all physical education  courses and intramural sports, Waterman was home for the varsity basketball and indoor track team until the opening of Yost Arena in 1922.  Wrestling and gymnastics teams also used Waterman gym.</p>
      <p>Yost Field House, completed in 1923, was the nation's first multi-purpose field house.  It was designed for indoor track and basketball, but also served as a practice and training facility for baseball, football and other sports.  Yost was home for the UM basketball team until 1967.  In 1973 Yost Field House was converted for use by the hockey team and renamed Yost Arena.  The hockey team had previously played at the Coliseum Building (located at the corner of  South Fifth Avenue and Hoover St.) which the university had purchased in 1925.  The Sports Coliseum now houses practice and training facilities for gymnastics.</p>
      <p>Baseball had originally been played at the old Regents Field.  The current university baseball field was laid out in 1923.  The grandstands were built in 1948 and remodeled in 1973.  Wooden bleachers were added in 1983.  The field was named Ray Fisher Stadium in 1967 in honor of  Ray Fisher, who coached Michigan baseball teams from 1921-1958.</p>
      <p>The first facility for the swimming team was the pool in the Michigan Union which opened in 1921.  In 1928 swimming events moved to the pool in the new Intramural Sports Building. In 1957 a new pool was constructed on the east end of the I-M Building.  The largest collegiate pool in the nation at the time, it was named for Matt Mann, UM swimming coach from 1924-1954.  The Don Canham Natatorium opened in 1989.</p>
      <p>The wrestling team originally trained in Waterman Gymnasium then moved to facilities in the Intramural Sports Building.  It now competes in Cliff Keen Arena on the site of the former Matt Mann Pool.  Keen Arena also hosts women's and men's gymnastics and women's volleyball.</p>
      <p>In recent years facilities have been added for women's softball, field hockey and soccer; all located at the southern end of Ferry Field. The Tisch Tennis Complex, located on South State St. just beyond the UM Golf Course, opened in 1997.</p>

          <p>The Sports Information Office  (SIO) as a separately functioning unit within the Athletic Department dates from 1925 when Philip Pack  was hired as publicity agent.  The  SIO subgroup includes material created by the office and material it collected or assembled, including material pre-dating 1925.  The sub-group is divided into a number of series based on record format and sport.  The series are: Scrapbooks, Press Releases, separate series for each of the varsity men's and women's sports, Minor Sports, Miscellaneous, and Official Rosters of Letter Winners.</p>
          <p>The Sports Information Office records  contain a separate series for each of the men's and women's varsity sports.  Each sport series in turn is composed of several standard sub-series
and files,  including Media Guides, Photographs (usually subdivided into files of team photos, individual portraits, and game action), and  Game or meet results.  For some sports there may also be game programs, and game films or videotapes.</p>
          <p>The Media Guides are produced by the Sports Information Office.  They include team rosters,  brief biographical information on team members and coaches, schedules, individual and team statistics, pictures of some or all team members, and a variety of historical information.  Modern media guides usually contain a roster of all individuals who have lettered in the sport.  The first formal media guide was produced for football in 1931.  Guides for other sports do not begin until the late 1930s or 1940s.   The format and size of the media guides have varied considerably over the years.  Until the 1960s,  media guides for sports other than football consisted of  two to ten mimeographed pages.   Media guides for women's' sports begin in 1976/77.  Initially they were simple brochures with roster and schedule information.  They now are comparable to media guides for men's sports.</p>
          <p>The Photographs subseries  for each sport includes the "official" team photograph for each year and occasionally other "informal" team photos s well as posed portraits of athletes in uniform and  game action photos.</p>
          <p>An official team photograph for each sport appears to have been taken each year, however, the  Athletic Department record group does not include team photos for all years for every sport.  Other collections in the Bentley Library contain athletic team photographs that complement or duplicate the photos in the Athletic Department records.  From approximately 1896 to 1968, the Rentschler Photography Studio took the official team photos for most sports.  The University of Michigan News and Information Service began taking team photographs in the early 1960s and has taken team photos since 1969.  The Bentley's Rentschler Studio and News and Information Service collections include original negatives of many team photos.   A compiled list of  team photographs  located in a number of Bentley Library collections is available at the library.  This is the most authoritative listing of team photographs.  It is arranged by sport and year and indicates the location of the photo and whether or not an original or copy negative exists.  For years for which a print or negative does not exist, a team photo  usually may be found in the school year book.</p>
          <p>Each sport includes a sub-series of Portraits and Action Photographs.  The portraits may include formal studio portraits - typically in uniform or letter-sweater, but sometimes in suit and tie - or more informal portraits taken on the practice field.  The latter are sometimes referred to as "picture day" photos referring to the annual "media day."   The Sports Information Office has conventionally differentiated the portraits as "head shots" - close-up portraits, "posed in uniform" - a still pose wearing game or practice uniform, or "posed action" - in which the athlete strikes a typical or stylized action pose.   The portraits are arranged chronologically.  If the exact date of a photograph is not known, it has generally been placed in the folder for the last year in which the athlete competed.  Researchers should examine folders for all years in which the athlete competed.  The Athletic Department records do not include portraits of every athlete.  For some years there are no individual photographs.  After the university News and Information Service began taking "picture day" photos, in the mid-1960s for most sports, the Athletic Department records may include only contact sheets of individual portraits.  Original negatives for most of these contact sheets can be found in the News and Information Service records.   For several sports there are separate files of headshots or posed action shots of All-American athletes.  As with team photos, the Bentley has many other collections that include photographs of individual athletes.  There is no comprehensive list or index to these collections.  Indexes to several of the more important collections are available at the library.  The Sports Information Office has retained  a significant number of  photographs of "star" athletes.</p>
          <p>The Action Photographs have been collected by the Sports Information Office from a number of "side-line photographers," including newspaper and wire-service photographers.  Copyright restrictions may apply to some of these photos.  Beginning in about 1970, some sports include game action contact sheets.  These photos were taken by  Bob Kalmbach, photographer with the News and Information Service.  Kalmbach holds the negatives  for these photos.</p>
          <p>Several sports series, football in particular, contain files of photos of Facilities and Miscellaneous topics.  Some sports also include a separate file of photographs of coaches.</p>
          <p>Most sports series include a sub-series of Game Programs and/or Season Statistics and Programs.  For football, basketball and hockey the game programs are filed separately and arranged by year.  For other sports, individual game programs are inter-filed with a variety of  game or meet results and statistics.  The earliest football program dates from 1894.  Through 1925 the football programs sub-series is very incomplete.  There are two or three programs for most years, but for some years there are no programs.  Following 1925, the collection of home game programs is nearly complete, while the away-game programs are about 60% complete.  An item listing of all football programs in the Athletic Department collection and several personal manuscript collections is available at the library.  Basketball and hockey programs are scattered until the mid-1960s.</p>
          <p>Individual game or meet programs for other sports are often little more than one or two page flyers.  Programs for major meets and  Big Ten or NCAA championships are more substantial.  The number of programs and the extent of  meet and season statistical information vary considerably among the various sports.</p>
          <p>Football is the only sport with a significant body of Game Films and Videotapes.  The earliest game film (the Bentley has a videotape copied from the original at the Library of Congress) is of  portions of the 1904 Michigan vs. Chicago game played in Ann Arbor.  The game was filmed by Edison Company and is one of the earliest known football game films.  There are scattered film clips and newsreels from the late 1920's including some footage of the dedication of Michigan Stadium in 1927.  Beginning in 1930 there are a few films (usually not complete games) for each year, except 1934.  After 1940 the game films are nearly complete.  A complete listing of all football game films in the Athletic Department record group as well as several from other collections is available at the library.   With a few exceptions, the films are the "coach's film" shot with a single camera from the top of the press box.  A few games from the 1950s-- which were delayed broadcast on television-- have sound.  Most films are black and white until the late 1960s.  Most game films and videotapes are stored off-site.  Generally two days notice is required for retrieval of these items.  The poor condition of some films may preclude their being projected</p>
          <p>The Athletic Department  record group has some basketball films covering the years 1954-1966, including footage from the "Cazzie Russell era," 1963-1966.   Most of the Cazzie Russell footage has been transferred to videotape.  There are only scattered films of other sports.  There are some videotapes of  women's sports and  men's minor sports from the mid-1980s that were taped by CTC Sports or by students for use on a local access cable TV program called "Wolverine Watch."  These tapes have not been fully catalogued.</p>
          <p>Media Guide,  Team and Individual Photograph, and Program/Results subseries for  varsity women's sports begin in 1977/78.  The records for women's basketball, cross country, swimming and diving, tennis and track are fairly complete. The library's holdings in women's  field hockey, golf, soccer, softball and volleyball represent only preliminary accessions, largely media guides and a few photographs. Records for these sports are still held by the Sports Information Office.  Rosters and some statistical information for women's sports, 1972-1977, can be found in the separately cataloged "University of Michigan. Women's Athletics" record group.</p>

              <p>The Main Series, 1902-1996, and continuing, was compiled by the Athletic Department.  It covers men's intercollegiate athletics and includes newspaper clippings from the  Michigan Daily, Ann Arbor News, Detroit Free Press and Detroit News, and occasionally from other out-of-town newspapers and national magazines.  The coverage for the years 1902 to approximately 1920 is somewhat spotty.  After 1920 coverage becomes much more thorough.  All varsity sports are covered.  The volumes for 1902-1927 are arranged by sport.  Beginning in September 1927 all sports are included in a single chronological order.   Individual clippings are occasionally out of order by as much as a week and there is some overlap between volumes.  Not all feature articles related to UM athletics appearing in the Daily or Detroit papers were clipped for the scrapbooks.</p>

              <p>The Fan's Scrapbooks subseries was apparently compiled by a U of M fan and donated to the Athletic Department.  The nine volumes cover the years 1942-1950 and are devoted almost exclusively to football.  There is some duplication with the Main Series, but the Fan's Scrapbooks contain many items not found in the Main Series, including numerous clippings from out-of-town papers.</p>

              <p>The Ben Friedman scrapbooks were compiled by the Friedman family and loaned to the Athletic Department for microfilming.  Friedman,  all-American quarterback in 1926, was one of the first nationally prominent  Jewish college athletes.  The scrapbooks, which cover his high school and professional career as well his Michigan years, are mainly clippings for his hometown Cleveland newspapers and the Jewish press.</p>

            <p>The Press Releases series consists of press releases produced  by the Sports Information Office, 1943-1996 and continuing.  Sometimes titled "Michigan Sports News," the releases were issued weekly.  They  provide information on upcoming games and events, give statistical summaries of the previous week's games and often a compilation of season statistics for teams and individuals.  The press releases are arranged chronologically (by calendar year 1943-1979 and  academic year beginning in 1979/80).  Beginning in 1983/84 the year's releases are further subdivided by sport.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Official  Rosters of Letter Winners (referred to as the  "Dope Books" by the Athletic Department) are arranged by year and sport.  (Note that in the early years, 1864-188?, the calendar year rather than the academic year is used.)  The record for each year includes lists of the officers of the Student Athletic Association, and/or Board in Control of Athletics, team managers, coaches and trainers;  game and meet scores, list of letter-winners, and for some sports in some years, lists of  junior varsity letter and freshman numeral winners.  It is not clear when the "Dope Books" were first compiled or how the letter winners for the early years were determined.  There are some anomalies, e.g., several captains of the football team in the 1880s are not listed as letter winners.  The lists of varsity letter winners that appear in media guides for the different sports are derived from the "Dope Books."</p>

          <p>The Football Office sub-group contains three series: Football Scouting Reports/Playbooks, 1938-1963, Miscellaneous Publications and Schembechler Topical Files.  The Scouting Reports/Playbooks cover the coaching careers of Fritz Crisler, Bennie Oosterbaan and the early years of Chalmers "Bump" Elliott.  They are arranged chronologically and include an analysis of each UM opponent and diagrams of Michigan plays and notes on game strategy.  Miscellaneous Publications includes football rules books, 1894-1940 and two volumes of lectures by Fielding Yost and Elton (Tad) Weiman for a coaches course they taught. The Schembechler Files mainly concern administrative matters and social activities.</p>

          <p>The Athletic Director's Office sub-group includes office files of Athletic Directors Jack Weidenbach and Joe Roberson, files relating to the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, of which the Athletic Director was a member, and material concerning the NCAA and Big Ten.  The records are organized in six series: Jack Weidenbach Files, Joe Roberson Files, Investigations,  University of Michigan Certification Steering Committee, and Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics.</p>
          <p>Administrative records of the Athletic Director's Office had previously been accessioned as part of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics records or as part of the personal papers of Fielding Yost, Fritz Crisler and Don Canham.</p>
          <p>The Athletic Directors records consist of topical files, correspondence, and reports dealing with both policy issues and day-to-day management of the department and the department's relations with and the director's participation in the affairs of the NCAA and Big Ten.  Also included are records of NCAA and Big Ten investigations of U of M athletic programs including baseball, 1989-1990 and basketball 1994-1997.</p>

            <p>The Big Ten and NCAA Investigations series includes documentation and reports of the Athletic Department's internal investigation of alleged  rules infractions and investigations conducted by the NCAA and the Big Ten.  The files include investigators notes, exhibits, transcripts and tapes of interviews and reports.  The series covers the baseball investigation of alleged payment to athletes, 1989-1990, and three basketball related inquiries: allegations regarding the possible transfer of basketball player Gary Trent, 1994;  the 1996 auto accident involving basketball players and recruits, and the university's inquiry into the Ed Martin affair. With the exception of the final reports, which have been publicly released, the records of the baseball investigation are closed pending removal of  individually identifiable student information.</p>

            <p>The Weidenbach series, which includes material created during the tenure of his predecessors Don Canham and Glen "Bo" Schembechler, is divided into three subseries: Topical Files, Correspondence, and Big Ten.  Of particular note in the Topical Files are the Gender Equity files documenting the department's implementation of Title IX and the various files relating to broadcasting and marketing and promotion.  The correspondence file consists largely of letters from fans and the public offering praise or criticism of some aspect of the university's athletic program --frequently complaints about tickets, seating or behavior of fans or athletes at games.  Other correspondence is generally filed under the appropriate heading in the topical file.</p>

            <p>Joe Roberson's records are also organized in three subseries: a topical file, correspondence, and Big Ten.  The files on gender equity include a number of  background articles, the university's response to the precedent setting Brown University case, staff and committee reports on the department's attempt to implement Title IX, and correspondence and proposals from Marcia Federbush, a local Title IX activist and critic of the
Department's gender equity efforts.  Other files of interest include several consultant' s reports on restructuring the department's sports information and publicity, development and marketing activities; files on corporate sponsorship-including NIKE, proposals to install sky boxes in Michigan Stadium and the awarding of television and radio broadcast rights.  The file on the department's contract with NIKE consists mainly of correspondence from within the university and from the general public, much of it critical of the "selling of the university."</p>

            <p>The Board in Control Records were received with the papers of the Athletic Directors and reflect the directors role on the Board, for many years the Athletic Director served as secretary of the Board.  Some of these records complement material found in the Board In Control of Intercollegiate Athletics record group.</p>
            <p>The series is organized in four subseries: administrative records, Committees, Correspondence and Topical File. The administrative records include original incorporation papers of the Board and its annual filing with the state;  annual reports, 1969-1979 and audits, 1993-1996.  The correspondence series consists primarily of internal communications of the Board.  The topical file includes two significant reports: the "Johnson Report," 1988, on the role and administration of athletics on campus and the "Nordby Report," 1985, on the integration of women's athletics into Big Ten Programs.</p>
