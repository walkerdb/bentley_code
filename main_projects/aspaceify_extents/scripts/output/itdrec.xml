      <p>Early in 1985, Douglas Van Houweling was appointed to the new position of Vice Provost for Information Technology. Later that year he was named head of a newly formed unit, Information Technology Division (ITD), consolidating academic and administrative computing services at the University of Michigan. By the end of the 1990s, ITD's function had evolved into managing complex computer networking and telecommunication systems while providing leadership in the innovative application of information technology in higher education.</p>
      <p>The management of computing resources at the university and the structure of ITD underwent a number of changes and reorganizations through the years concurrent with, and in response to, rapidly changing technology. Prior to 1985, oversight of campus computing activities fell under several jurisdictions. The Academic Computing Center reported to the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) while the Data Systems Center was a unit of the Office of Administrative Systems under the Vice President for Finance. The University Committee on Computer Policy and Utilization (UCCPU), established in 1965, was the primary advisory committee to the VPAA on computing issues. The committee coordinated policy among the units and also reviewed all significant computer acquisitions. With the creation of ITD, the UCCPU was disbanded in 1985.</p>
      <p>The Computing Policy Committee (CPC), originally proposed in 1984, was established in 1985 as the primary advisory committee to the Vice Provost for Information Technology. Its function was to recommend and review long-range policies for computing, in the broadest sense and covering all parts of the university, and to review budget allocations for computing and information technology. The committee was chaired by the VP for Information Technology; members included the deputy vice provost and director of the computing center, director of administrative systems, director of the University Library, associate director of the University Hospital, eight faculty, two administrators, and (later) two students.</p>
      <p>In 1987 it was determined that a single committee could not effectively address both planning and policy issues. The Computing Policy Committee was disbanded and its planning and policy functions divided between the newly created Information Technology General Council (ITGC) and the Information Technology Policies Committee (ITPC). An Executive Computing Committee, comprised of the Vice Provost for Information Technology, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Vice President for Research, was made responsible for overall supervision of information technology on campus.</p>
      <p>ITD's administrative structure by 1994 included a number of divisions: Computing Center, Office of Administrative Systems (both of which predated ITD), Center for Information Technology Integration, Consulting and Support Services, Instructional Technology Systems, Network Systems, Research Systems, Resource Administration, and University Information Systems.</p>
      <p>The Computing Center, established in 1959 as the Academic Computing Center, managed the mainframe computers and provided users with tutorial support and access to terminals, microcomputers, line and laser printers, electronic mail and conferencing systems, network access, and other advanced information technology. In the mid-1960s, Computing Center research staff developed the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) as the operating system on the International Business Machines (IBM) system 360 model 66m, the first university computer with online capabilities. MTS provided a high quality, centralized, interactive facility for time-shared computing that formed the foundation of campus computing activity for two decades.</p>
      <p>During the 1980s, two major trends in computing emerged at the university that required a reevaluation of the university's computing resources. First, there was a shift away from mainframe computing to distributed computing, and second, the number of new computer users within the university community increased dramatically. In response to the demands of these new users, the Computing Center introduced new services and equipment, such as public workstations, applications software, and microcomputer education, and began exploring new operating systems as possible alternatives to MTS.</p>
      <p>The Office of Administrative Systems (OAS) was divided into five subdivisions: the Data Systems Center, Information Systems Services, Telecommunications Systems, Administrative Support, and Systems Security. The OAS was responsible for "providing information systems containing university data, providing large-scale integrated databases for central administrative functions, and assisting units and individuals with the creation and use of their own systems for administrative computing." The two major projects of the OAS in the mid 1980s were the design and implementation of a new, centralized online admissions system, and the development of UMTel, a new university telecommunications system. The Research Systems, Center for Information Technology Integration, and Instructional Technology divisions undertook significant in-house and collaborative research including software development and testing, educational applications, and development of the Institutional File System.</p>
      <p>The Computing Center and ITD were involved early in the development and operation of computer networks. The Merit Computer Network, based at the University of Michigan, was initiated as an educational, inter-university network linking several of Michigan's public universities. Proposals for a network linking the state's major universities were first made in 1964. In 1966, Wayne State, Michigan State, and University of Michigan formed Merit Inc., a non-profit corporation, to develop and manage the network. Development funds were obtained in 1969 from a state appropriation and a National Science Foundation Grant; the network became operational in 1972. Since that time, numerous public and private institutions joined the network. In 1984/1985, the Merit staff and the communications staff of the Computing Center, which oversaw UMNet (the local branch of Merit), were merged. Douglas Van Houweling was named chairman of the Board of Directors of Merit, and Bertram Herzog was selected as the first director in 1968. Eric Aupperle succeeded him in 1974. In 1987 Merit, in partnership with IBM and MCI, won the contract to develop and operate the National Science Foundation's national network backbone, NSFNET, connecting the six NSF supercomputing sites and numerous regional networks and university computing centers. ITD also hosted CICNet, a network linking members of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, essentially the Big Ten universities and the University of Chicago.</p>
      <p>Phase out of MTS, the heart of the university's academic computing system for more than two decades, began in the late 1980s. ITD was redefined to focus on network development and orienting users to a networked environment, while further integrating academic and administrative computing on campus. Gregory Marks, as deputy vice provost for information technology, managed much of the overall internal administration of this evolution from the mid 1980s through the mid 1990s. Van Houweling, functioning as vice provost for information technology and named in 1995 to the newly created post of dean for academic outreach, continued to be involved in a broad array of organizations at the national level, serving on numbers of government, corporate and academic advisory boards and panels.</p>
      <p>In 1996, Van Houweling left ITD to become president and chief executive officer of the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID), a consortium of more then 100 universities working with corporate partners and federal agencies to develop Internet2. Jose(-Marie Griffiths was named executive director of ITD and chief information officer for the university. Early in her leadership, she reduced mid-level management and targeted ITD's focus on areas involving direct interaction with customers. In 1999, Griffiths was appointed to the National Research Council (NRC) Computer Science and Telecommunications Board's project on information technology strategy for the Library of Congress. In the same year, she announced the creation of a "'federation' of university information technology organizations to better plan and manage the University's information technology infrastructure and services.1" Griffith charged the newly formed Federation Executive Committee with the responsibility of identifying resources and needs across the university. Griffith's tenure as the second chief information officer ended in 2001. Her departure closed the door on the position of the chief information officer at the university. Instead, two newly formed organizations, Michigan Administrative Information Services (MAIS) and Information Technology Central Services (ITCS) have the responsibility for all aspects of computing at the university. MAIS reports to the office of the executive vice president and chief financial officer and has five core functions, management of three administrative systems Financial, Human Resources, and Student Administration; Integrated Information Delivery; Technical Infrastructure Operation; and User Consulting. Information Technology Central Services reports to the associate provost for academic, information and instructional technology affairs and supports five core divisions, Information Technology Communications Services (ITCS), University of Michigan Computing Environment (UMCE), User Advocate, User Services, and Web Applications, Technologies, and Solutions (WATS).</p>

          <p>The Central Files series (12.5 linear ft., 1984-1997) is the main administrative file of the division. It is organized into two subseries, 1984-1992 and 194-1997, reflecting different accessions. Each subseries is organized in a number of sub-subseries including: Historical Files, Audit records, Budgets, Committees-ITD, Committees-University-Wide, Correspondence and Topical file.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>Historical files are mainly news clippings featuring computing at the University of Michigan and organizational charts for 1985 to 1991. Audits include thorough reports on 1985 to 1987 external audits of ITD operations (including ITD responses) and a 1991 ITD response to an internal audit. There is also some information on a Medical Information Systems audit. (Note: The subseries does not include records on the 1992/93 audit following allegations of ITD overcharges to federally sponsored projects.) Budgets, 1985 to 1991, include correspondence and reports on the ITD budget process, as well as some background information.</p>
            <p>The Committees sub-subseries is further divided into ITD Committees and University-wide committees. Files of the Computing Policy Committee (CPC), Information Technology General Council (ITGC), Information Technology Policies Committee (ITPC), and Executive Computing Committee (ECC) provide the broadest overview of campus information technology issues and are among the most significant. Also important are the files of the Information Technology Architecture Committee (ITAC), formed in 1986 to provide the functional and broad technical specifications for the systems implemented by ITD over the next several years, and the Strategic Planning Committee files. The latter include minutes, Van Houweling's notes, and drafts of the 1989 report "Strategic Directions for Information Technology at the University of Michigan." The Senior Managers Committee files, which include minutes of monthly meetings and several retreats, offer the best source on internal management of ITD.</p>
            <p>Topical files are arranged alphabetically. Significant files include Grants, ITD Vision Statement, MEET:STUDENTS Computer Conference, Policy Statements, Supercomputers, and Van Houweling. Grant files provide examples of the types of projects encouraged and supported by ITD, promoting the educational use of information technology. The ITD Vision statement file consists of notes for a 1990 presentation by Van Houweling. MEET:STUDENTS records document the controversy over the appearance of allegedly racist and sexist comments in the "Bad Joke" item of an ITD sponsored computer conference. Included is the text of the item, correspondence, memoranda and a printout of a discussion about the controversy from online discussion in the MEET:PLANNERS computer conference. The MEET:PLANNERS discussion raises issues of free speech, acceptable behavior on computer conferences and ITD’s response to the controversy.</p>
            <p>Policy Statements contain a number of ITD policies on the use of computing facilities including: "Conditions of Use," "Proper Use of Information Resources," "Information Technology and Networks," and "Guidelines for Interaction with Corporate Representatives.” There is also a small file on ITD policy relating to Freedom of Information Act Requests. (Note: The records do not include files on the 1992 to 1994 FOIA requests arising from a controversy over access to private computer conferences.) The Supercomputer files document ITD’s unsuccessful bid to become host for one of six NSF supercomputing sites in 1986. The Van Houweling files include biographical material, resumes, a May 1989 interview transcript and two folders of speeches and articles.</p>
            <p>Other files of interest in Topical Files include material on ITD’s 1989 reorganization and Research Resources, a printout describing resources of the Computing Center and resources available in various colleges and departments. The last of these includes an overview of the development of computing at Michigan and describes the machines, programs, and services available in 1985.</p>

              <p>There are two subseries dealing with committees: ITD Committees and University-wide and Beyond Committees. These subseries consist of enhanced documentation for several internal initiatives, such as total quality management. Documentation is continued for important university-wide technology oriented committees. Records of the Information Technology General Council (ITGC), an 80-member body created in 1988, provide documentation on the exchange of concerns and suggestions generated from a broad membership representing all units on campus. The records of the Information Technology Policy Committee (ITPC), a ten-member advisory panel, are a source for gaining an overview on issues requiring analysis, strategic direction, and policy recommendation The records of the Information Technology Architecture Committee (ITAC), formed in 1987 as a standing committee of ITPC, document the coordination of UM’s evolving integrated computing environment. Since ITPC, ITGC, and ITD senior managers report to the Executive Computing Committee (ECC), the ECC files are the best resource for garnering information on priority setting, resource allocation and final strategic direction for the development of University of Michigan information technology. Committee files typically include minutes, agendas, correspondence and often include important background information on issues under discussion. Additional material related to these major committees is held in the Deputy Vice Provost for Information Technology series of this record group (Gregory Marks served as the initial chair of ITAC), and in the Computing Center record group. The records in the Committees subseries also include files generated by Van Houweling’s service on several committees organized by President Duderstadt.</p>

              <p>The correspondence subseries is slight and is comprised partly of traditional correspondence, as well as printouts of electronic mail. There is also a file of e-mail printouts in the Topical Files subseries, reflecting the early use ITD staff made of the technology for internal and external communication. The Topical Files subseries, arranged alphabetically, reflects ITD’s involvement in community generated activities, national initiatives, internal and external projects, and long-range planning. Van Houweling’s participation in the deliberation of policy at the national level is evident in files including the Council on Competitiveness, Vision 2010, the Democratic Issues Group, the National Information Infrastructure and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Speeches files hold transcripts of several of Van Houweling Washington, D.C. testimonials. Also of significance are several folders documenting the phasing out of MTS (Michigan Terminal System) and ITD’s efforts to manage controversy during the transition to distributed computing. Included is a 1994 document entitled, “Moving from an MTS Centered Computing Environment to Distributed Computing Environment,” which was designed to clarify issues and answer questions. Other files of significance include records documenting reorganizations in 1990/1991 and 1994/1995. Changes in 1991 involved major cuts and reallocations in an era of cost restraints; 1995 brought dramatic restructuring and significant downsizing with a movement toward highly service focused technical staffing. The series also contains several reports, including “Priority Services Review: Perceived Value Study Report,” 1991 and “Special Task Force on Statistical Support at the University of Michigan,” 1989.</p>

          <p>The Division series is divided into three subseries: 1976-1992, 1986-1995, and 1964-1994, reflecting separate accessions. The series contains records from ITD's many different administrative divisions, including the Center for Information Technology Integration, and the Computing Center. Records contain information on the activities and projects of each division, as well as information on their core functions and structure.</p>

            <p>The 1976-1992 subseries (3 linear ft.) includes records of the administrative units of ITD from Van Houweling's office files, including the Center for Information Technology Integration (CITI), Computing Center, Consulting Support Services, Instructional Technology Systems, Network Systems, Office of Administrative Systems, Research Systems, Resource Administration, and University Information Systems. CITI files hold correspondence and reports on various projects, most notably the development of the Institutional File System (IFS). Records for the Computing Center (some pre-dating the establishment of ITD) document its management and planning through advisory and planning reports. Also of interest is the Computer Use Allocations file, a tally of computing funds distributed to various units on campus. Office of Administration Systems records includes general correspondence and a chronological run of correspondence from the office of division director Sam Plice. Research Systems material also contains documentation on the development of IFS and a 1992 report to ITD staff on the future of MTS.</p>

            <p>The Divisions, 1986-1995 subseries (2 linear ft.) is most substantive for CITI (Center for the Information Technology Integration), primarily with documentation for the development of IFS. The $40 million prototype system, known at inception internally as “Strawman,” was collaboration with IBM orchestrated by Van Houweling and directed by Gregory Marks. The records provide detailed technical documentation for the development of the software that allowed data to be shared among different computer operating systems without users having to engage in explicit file transfer procedures. The files also include a 1990 history of the project, media announcements, meeting minutes, correspondence, notes and planning documents. The evolution of the project is evident in “Summary of the IFS Project,” 1988; “IFS: An Overview,” 1988; and in a folder entitled “Contract Negotiations,” 1988. Some additional documentation on the IFS project is held in the Computing Center record group. Less extensive, but interesting, material exists for other ITD units: Network Systems, Research Systems, User Services, University Information Systems, and Instructional Technology Systems. Of particular interest in the Research Systems file is a report to the director (Bert Herzog) raising issues, concerns, and offering recommendations during a 1990 reorganization planning period. The folder also contains notes for a dialogue with Van Houweling two years later, after significant downsizing and a lack of clarity on the future of MTS led to uneasiness among staff. Instructional Technology Systems files document the management of campus computing sites, sales and services for instructional computing. Network Systems files offer some illustration of the work of the unit in coordinating several campus and national networking initiatives, including MichNet, UMnet and UMTel, the Telecommunication Systems Office.</p>

            <p>The 1984-1994 subseries (4 linear ft.) is comprised of administrative files created within the Computing Center division. There is, however, material created by other ITD divisions and projects. The earliest material in the series is a cluster of documentation relating to MicroGroup. This group, formed at the request of Aaron Finerman, Director, Computer Center, in 1983. The formation of the group was a response to IBM’s announcement of the “personal computer.” By 1987, increased demand for personal computers dispersed this group into the overall ITD organization structure.</p>

            <p>The 1984-1992 subseries (4 linear ft.) documents the university's and ITD's participation in a number of local, regional, and national computer networking organizations, including Bitnet, CICNet (Committee on Institutional Cooperation Network), CREN (Corporation for Research and Educational Networking), Merit, MITN (Michigan Information Technology Network), NREN (National Research and Educational Network), NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network), and ONENET. The material reflects the university's participation as member, host, or manager and/or Van Houweling's service as a board member or advisor. The Merit, NSFNet, and CICNet records are the most significant. Since Merit managed the NSFNET network, researchers should note that the Merit files hold considerable material on NSFNET. Other records include Board of Directors minutes, correspondence, and a topical file. Of particular note in the topical file are drafts entitled "Merit: Michigan Universities Computer Network" and an unpublished paper on the history of Merit, 1989. There are also copies of the agreements among UM, NSF and Merit, including several grant proposals. (Note: This is not the archives of Merit, but only material collected by Van Houweling in his role as chairman of the board.) The NSFNet files include executive committee minutes and correspondence, quarterly and annual reports on the operation of the network, and speeches by Van Houweling about NSFNet. Photographs and network diagrams of Merit and NSFNet can be found in the Photographs series. The CICNet material is comprised of a single chronological file of correspondence, minutes and reports. Also included in the Networks series is material related to Project EXPRES (Experimental Research in Electronic Submission). This was a collaborative project among ITD, the College of Engineering, and other units to develop protocols and standard formats for electronic submission and exchange of journal articles between dissimilar environments, particularly complex, graphically intense subjects in science and engineering. The records include a grant proposal, correspondence, reports, and publicity material, 1987 to 1989.</p>

            <p>The Networks, 1990-1995 subseries (1.5 linear ft.) includes records of the Committee for Institutional Cooperation Network (CICnet), the Corporation for Research and Educational Networking (CREN), Merit Network, Inc., and NSFNet (National Science Foundation). Records related to CICnet and CREN are more extensive in the previous subseries, but there is significant documentation for Merit and NSFNet in this accession. Since Merit managed the National Science Foundation backbone network, however, it is important to note that there is overlap between the two. There is also overlap with the records of the Computing Center record group. Included in the NSFNet files are drafts and a final version of the 1987 proposal submitted to the NSF on August 14, 1987. The files also include a transcript for the House of Representatives’ Committee on Science, Space, and Technology proceedings on March 17, 1992, during which Van Houweling reported on the enormous success of the network. His speech ideas and a draft are also in the folder. Merit files represent Van Houweling’s board participation and are not the archives of the network; files include meeting minutes, budgets, reports, proposals (all incomplete). Among the documents are a 1990 marketing plan, a strategic planning retreat in 1992, a 1990 kindergarten to grade 12 training guide, and a 1995 consultant’s report, “Analysis of Gender Bias Issues.”</p>

          <p>The University Files series contains correspondence and other records which document ITDs involvement with other university-based organizations, such as the Media Union, and the Library System. The series is divided into two subseries, 1984-1992 and 1992-1997, reflecting two separate accessions.</p>

            <p>The 1984-1992 subseries (2 linear ft.) consists largely of correspondence between ITD and academic and administrative units. It is divided into two subseries: Executive and Administrative Offices and Academic and Support Units. Files for individual units range from several items to several folders and provide information on the state of computing, information technology development, and unit computing applications. The records also reflect programmatic and budgetary concerns during a period of rapid change in the campus computing environment.</p>

            <p>The 1992-1997 University Files subseries (1.5 linear ft.) provides insight into ITD interactions with administrative and academic units on campus in the mid 1990s. The most substantial materials are for the Media Union, which before its dedication was known as ITIC (Integrated Technology Information Center), and known before that as the North Campus General Library. The records include program plans; executive meeting minutes, notes and agendas; art committee meeting minutes; and an Albert Kahn &amp; Associates program analysis, 1989. The material documents the discussion that resulted in a program statement to integrate information technology into instruction, design and research, particularly in the areas of engineering, architecture and the creative arts. Media Union documentation is also held in the Deputy Vice-Provost for Information Technology series under ITIC. Other files of interest include Literature, Science &amp; the Arts and the School of Natural Resources. LS&amp;A files document the unit’s efforts in the late 1980s and early 1990s to more fully embrace computing for instruction and teaching. Included is a 1991 report entitled, “Computing in LS&amp;A: A Long Range Plan.” The planning document spoke directly to problems the school believed needed to be addressed by and with ITD in order to accommodate the changing needs of its faculty, staff, and students. Files for the School of Natural Resources document SNR’s interest in utilizing geographic information systems.</p>

            <p>The 1984-1992 subseries (2.5 linear ft.) consists of ITD and Van Houweling correspondence, reports, and other material relating to computer, telecommunications, and software companies. The records document purchases, lease arrangements, and development projects with corporations such as Apple and IBM as the most significant. The correspondence and topical material in the Apple files document the close working relationship that developed between Apple and ITD in promoting the use of personal computers in education. The IBM files include correspondence and topical files for mainframe, personal computers, and networking issues. Of particular note are files on IFS (Institutional File System) development, 1985 to 1988, and the purchase and installation of the IBM 3090 computer, 1986 to 1987. Photographs of many of these IBM machines can be found in the Photographs series.</p>

            <p>The 1985-1994 subseries (2.5 linear ft.) consists of ITD and Van Houweling correspondence, reports, and other material relating to computer, telecommunications, and software companies. The records document purchases, lease arrangements, and development projects with corporations such as Apple and IBM as the most significant. The correspondence and topical material in the Apple files document the close working relationship that developed between Apple and ITD in promoting the use of personal computers in education. The IBM files include correspondence and topical files for mainframe, personal computers, and networking issues. Of particular note are files on IFS (Institutional File System) development, 1985 to 1988, and the purchase and installation of the IBM 3090 computer, 1986 to 1987. Photographs of many of these IBM machines can be found in the Photographs series.</p>

            <p>The 1984-1993 subseries (4.5 linear ft.) includes material from a number of computing related organizations with which ITD was involved or in which Van Houweling was an officer or active participant. EDUCOM and CIESIN (Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network) are the largest and most substantial. EDUCOM, which was founded at the University of Michigan, is a national organization concerned with a variety of issues relating to information technology and education. Van Houweling served on the Board of Directors and on several task forces. The material includes general correspondence, minutes of Board meetings, and correspondence relating to the Networking and Telecommunications Task Force. There is one folder on the 1989 EDUCOM meeting held in Ann Arbor and two videotapes of the general session featuring a speech by John Akers and award presentations. Photographs of the 1989 meeting can be found in the Photographs series. CIESIN is a congressionally funded organization of universities, research institutes, government agencies, and private corporations set up to facilitate the use of global change information resources, to promote interdisciplinary study of global change, and to stimulate the interaction of the public, policymakers, and scientists. The University of Michigan was a founding member, and ITD was closely involved in the computing and networking aspects of the project. Van Houweling served on the Board of Trustees. The files include minutes of board and executive meetings, correspondence, reports and a topical file. Of particular note in the topical file are two folders on the UM/ITD-CIESIN relationship. Other organizational files of interest include Carnegie-Mellon University, which contains reports on several campus computer projects initiated during Van Houweling's tenure at Carnegie, the Midwest Technology Development Institute and the Michigan Coalition for Enabling Technology.</p>

            <p>The Organizations 1983-1997 subseries (1 linear ft.) illustrates Van Houweling’s high level of participation in national organizations (he served on numerous advisory panels related to the developing Internet), and the marked influence of a burgeoning national interest in technology on ITD. The records consist of correspondence, meeting minutes, and notes for numbers of organizations that organized, encouraged, and promoted cooperation and sharing knowledge in a networked world. The most extensive material is for EDUCOM and the Research Libraries Group (RLG). The Higher Education Information Resources Alliance (HEIR) file includes drafts and background papers for a strategic report entitled, “What Presidents Need to Know About the Impact of Computers on Campus,��� 1993. President Duderstadt, Van Houweling, library dean Donald Riggs, and Network Systems director, Michael McGill, drafted the paper. The University of Michigan experience was highlighted as a base for providing university presidents with decision-making guidelines on creating, managing, and envisioning technological environments.</p>

          <p>The Deputy Vice-Provost for Information Technology series (11.5 linear ft., 1982-1991) is arranged into three chronological subseries, reflecting the order in which they were maintained: 1982-1988; 1988-1990; 1990-1991. The files are arranged alphabetically. The material includes files on various ITD units, internal and external committees; projects; interactions with schools, colleges and administrators; budgets and budget planning; and further data on the IFS / IBM project. Many of the files contain computer printouts of electronic mail. Marks often conducted business and communicated with staff and colleagues via the network and maintained the records for paper files. The 1982-1988 subseries contains a file on strategic planning, 1986-1988, with drafts and documents that provide a succinct history of UM computing and an overview of the state of technology at the time.</p>

          <p>The Virginia Rezmierski Files, accessioned in 2000, are mainly for the period from 1987 to 1997. Rezmierski held the positions of assistant to the vice provost for policy studies and assistant to the vice provost for information technology. The papers reflect her role in coordinating information technology policy initiatives starting with the reorganization of the Computing Policy Committee in 1987. The series includes documentation on the Information Technology General Council and Information Technology Policy Committee. The series is comprised of four subseries: Administrative Files, Information Technology General Council (ITGC), Information Technology Policy Committee (ITPC), Information Technology Security Education and Coordinated University Response Committee (ITSECUR).</p>

            <p>Information Technology General Council (ITGC) (.25 linear feet, 1987-1990) was one of the two committees formed in 1987 following the reorganization of the Computing Policy Committee. The main function of the ITGC was to serve as the principal mechanism for information exchange and communication. Committee members were elected for one-year terms and included representatives from the academic and administrative units as well as student representation. The series in this subgroup is limited in size and consists mainly of meeting agenda material for 1990.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The series Information Technology Policy Committee (ITPC) (3.5 linear feet, 1983-1997), represents the largest and most complete series in the subgroup. With the reorganization of the Computing Center Committee in 1987, the ITPC was the second newly formed policy committee (along with the Information Technology General Council). The main function of the nine-member ITPC was to serve as a high-level advisory group. Membership on this committee was through nomination by the vice provost for information technology. Membership length was three-year renewable terms with rotating expiration dates. The series contains the charge to the committee and meeting agendas and minutes spanning from January 1988 through July 1997. Meeting minutes are arranged by date of meeting and documentation includes Rezmierzki’s hand-written notes as well as print-outs of electronic communications she had with individual committee members. The series nicely reflects Rezmierski’s organization and planning skills in documentation on priority setting, agenda planning, meeting evaluations and summary of action items.</p>

            <p>Information Technology Policy Committee-Special Charge (ITPCSPEC) (.25 linear feet, 1981-1994). In January 1993, provost and vice president for academic affairs, Gilbert Whitaker, assigned the ITPC a special charge. The charge was to provide advice on policy in support of the University’s “electronic community.” Specific issues the committee was asked to address included the role of electronic conferencing in research and teaching; computer access to illegal materials; security and privacy of electronic communication; management policies in relationship to access and use of information technology resources at the university. Committee membership consisted of a subset of the ITPC, one student representative and three committee consultants. The series contains the key documents produced by this specially charged committee including the charge to the committee, meeting minutes, and the final report written by the committee, Policies in Support of the University’s Electronic Community.</p>

          <p>The Computer Sales Program (.75 linear feet, 1986-1993) series, while slight, does show the university’s effort to fulfill the sudden demand for desktop computers on campus. This series includes a draft memorandum titled the “Background and History of the Sales Program at Michigan,” possibly written by Greg Marks. Sales of computers began at the university in the fall of 1983 when the university was invited to become one of the original members of the Apple University Consortium. By 1986, the computer sales program was selling Apple, IBM, Zenith and Wang computers. In 1986 alone over 2,000 personal computers were sold. Full-scale “computer kickoffs” were put in place by the fall of 1988. Researchers can view photographs of the 1991 kickoff in the Photographs series. Doug Van Houweling saw the future of computing technology and argued in a paper titled The Computer Sales Program at the University of Michigan, that the “sales help create the foundation and properly position the University for the pervasive, integral role of information technology in the University’s future.” This series provides material on the 1993 Internal Revenue Service audit of the computer sales program. The series also includes a memorandum (draft version) written by Baker and McKenzie re: 1989-1992 Income Tax Audit Computer Sales (Issue No. 3), December 29, 1993. The paper outlines the university’s argument for why they viewed income generated by the computer sales program as exempt from taxable income.</p>

          <p>The Computing Sites (2.25 linear feet, 1985-1994) series reveals the tremendous increase in the demand by faculty and students for computing technology on campus. This almost sudden demand, created by the introduction of the desktop computer in the mid-1980s, is evident in the materials within this series. By the early 1990s, the lines outside the largest computing site, Angell Hall, snaked down the hallway every evening. Students found themselves waiting two or more hours just to use a computer for word processing. Interesting documentation printed excerpts from the CONFER (online discussion) hosted on MEET:STUDENTS More Computers Needed! and a flurry of electronic mail messages sent to Doug Van Houweling by irate students accompanied by a petition signed by over 800 students for longer hours at Angell Hall. Parallel to the growth of the computing sites services, a project designed to reach out to students in the residence halls was started in 1985. One of the first university residential computing programs in the country, ResComp, combined computer access with consulting support to over 14,000 students. Included in this series is the Proposal for Study of Residential Hall Computing Project and Impact of Information Technology on Undergraduates, presented at the Residence Hall Computing Program Symposium in 1988. The series does include documentation most of the other campus computing sites such as NUBS, 611 Church Street, but is strongest for Angell Hall and ResComp.</p>

          <p>The Dean’s Partnership Program (1 linear foot, 1991-1998) series is comprised of materials from the model partnership forged between ITD and the College of Literature, Science and the Arts in 1991. The Dean’s program essentially sought both to prioritize and customize the specific technology needs for each academic unit during a crucial transition from centralized to distributed computing. While the program was designed to customize needs, there were several common technology related issues facing academic units. Common needs included assistance in migrating data and procedures from the Michigan Terminal System to a client/server infrastructure; workstation configuration; faculty desktop computing; and departmental network development and training. Partnership agreements in this series include “contracts” signed off under Vice Provost Doug Van Houweling and Chief Information Officer Jose-Marie Griffith.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series (3 linear ft. in 4 boxes, 1956-1997), accessioned in 2004/2005, nicely complement the ITD record group as the photographs document much of the evolution and history of the Information Technology Division. Photographs have been divided into four subseries: Computing, Events, People and Organizations, and Systems and Networks.</p>

            <p>The Computing subseries (0.4 linear ft.) illustrates ITD’s role in computing on campus. Here, one can find ITD artwork for campus publications and brochures as well as mockups for an early identification card. More extensively, this series documents the north campus computing center, with drawings and photographs of the building of the computing center to the move of the machine room to the first floor in 1983. Many of the computing center photographs also show students and faculty using computers as well as many photos of computing center staff and networks and systems. Researchers can also find photographs of the 1997 orientation in a binder in Box 64 that includes photographs of Rescomp sites and activities. This subseries also documents the various computing events and activities held by ITD or sponsored by ITD including photographs of the 1971 Computing Center dedication and the Computing Center’s 20th anniversary in 1979. Photographs of various tech fairs in the 1980s can be found here as well as extensive documentation of the 1989 EDUCOM conference in Ann Arbor.</p>

            <p>The Systems and Networks series (0.5 linear ft.) contains photographs of many of the different systems and networks used throughout ITD’s history including photographs of several different [versions] of IBM and Amdahl machines, MTS and Merit photographs, various network diagrams and graphs, as well as keyboard diagrams for several machines. Of special note is the History folder, which contains photographs and captions used for a display on the history of ITD and computing. These photographs, some dating from the 1950s, nicely illustrate the history and evolution of the various ITD systems and networks to the 1980s.</p>
