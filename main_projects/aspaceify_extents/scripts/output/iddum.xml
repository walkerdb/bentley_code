      <abstract>Division of the Institute of Science and Technology primarily established to provide a link between higher technology research at the University of Michigan and private industries in the State of Michigan. Transferred into the School of Business Administration and the College of Engineering's Office of Technology Transfer in the late 1980s. The record group documents the administration, history, and projects of the Industrial Development Division and includes five series: Administrative File, Historical File, Projects, Public Relations, and Reports.</abstract>

      <p>The Industrial Development Division (IDD) was established in 1960 within the Institute of Science and Technology (IST), which had been created the previous year with the broad goal of providing state support for the private industries of Michigan. IDD was charged with two basic initiatives: to determine how science and technology could be utilized more effectively to aid state industry and to assist industry by organizing and implementing programs analogous to those existing state programs which aided agriculture. In fulfilling these missions, IDD played two roles. First, it served as a locus where state industrial, educational, governmental, professional, and civic groups could collaborate in research and organizational activities to better exploit their individual capabilities. Second, it supported and conducted studies to determine the needs of Michigan industries and to develop solutions to these needs through the utilization of new technology.</p>
      <p>The products of the work of IDD were several conferences and research publications. As noted in "Fifteen Years, 1960-1974," a short history of IDD (Box 1, Historical Files), the unit engaged in "industry research," different than purely scientific or technological research in that it considers the "interrelations of the business, economic, marketing, financing, employment, legal, and social factors" with the technological solutions it develops. Extensive and widely varied topics of research and conferences included electronics, machine tools, computers, solar energy, manufacturing, the automotive industry, manufacturing, pollution, housing, and management techniques. IDD also performed a consulting function, serving as a liaison between industrial, governmental and academic spheres, which provided information on where answers to technological and economic questions could be found. Finally, through its work, IDD also provided educational and occupational opportunities for graduate students in business administration, law, and engineering, many of whom went on to teach in other institutions, increasing the expansive network of IDD.</p>
      <p>In the late 1980s, the programs of IDD were separated and housed within the School of Engineering's Office of Technology Transfer and the School of Business Administration. The Office of Technology Transfer has since been disbanded, and the functions of IDD that were housed there have been incorporated into other parts of the school. As of this writing (January 1997), the Business/Industry Economic Division of IDD still exists within the School of Business Administration.</p>

      <p>The records of the Industrial Development Division measure two linear feet and range from 1960 to 1991. These materials provide particularly good documentation of some of the programs and projects run through this unit. The record group is divided into five series: Administrative File, Historical File, Projects, Public Relations, and Reports, and Publications.</p>

          <p>The Administrative File holds the records of various committees within IDD and documentation of various reviews of the unit. "Memoranda and Correspondence" primarily contains departmental communications with other university offices. Records of two Review Committees, 1978 and 1984-1985, pertain to analyses of IDD and its original parent organization, Institute of Science and Technology (IST). These folders hold valuable documentation on the status of IDD at those times. The "Realignment" folders contain materials relating to IDD's administrative shift from IST to the College of Engineering and the School of Business.</p>

          <p>The Projects series consists of documents relating to some of the major programs IDD has initiated. Along with a small number of administrative records, most of the documents in this series are project proposals and status reports of each program. The following subseries hold substantial records. The "Aluminum Study" examined the economic and environmental impacts of the replacement of iron and steel with aluminum in many industries. The "Automotive Community Adjustment Program" attempted to confront problems caused by the loss of jobs in the automotive industry during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The "Innovation Center" was designed to facilitate the transfer of technology developed in academic research laboratories to the commercial sector and to stimulate the formation of small high-technology companies. In the "Mills Study," IDD worked through a grant from the Office of Economic Expansion within the Michigan Department of Commerce to explore the possibility of establishing a mill to recycle scrap iron into steel.</p>

          <p>Public Relations is a small series that includes the "Brag Files," so called because they contain complimentary clippings and correspondence from companies and individuals with whom IDD worked. Similarly, "Testimonial Letters" contains letters thanking IDD and acknowledging the positive effects of the division's efforts.</p>

          <p>The Reports series holds general reports on the affairs of IDD. "Annual Reports" and "Presidents Reports" are annual overviews of the unit submitted to the president of the university and are an excellent source for identifying the activities of IDD in select years. The reports in these two folders cover each academic year between 1967-68 and 1987-88. "Executive Summaries" give short synopses of the division's activities from 1990 to 1991.</p>

          <p>Publications (4 linear feet, 1959-1990) is divided into two series: "Monographs" and "Studies." "Monographs" (3 linear feet, 1963-1990) are published papers of IDD research findings. The most common topics are research related to how small and medium-sized firms function, the management of industrial firms, the use of computers and other technology in industrial production, predictions for the future of industry in Michigan, and surveys of research on industry that has been conducted nationally and internationally. The monographs are arranged alphabetically by title. "Studies" (1 linear foot, 1959-1988) includes papers prepared for conferences or as part of cooperation between academic and industry research groups. The majority of the papers are analyses of Michigan's automotive industry, as well as steel production and opportunities for growth in Michigan industry.</p>
