      <p>The Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FASAP) at the University of Michigan traces its origins back to 1973, when Staff and Union Relations (a sub-unit of Personnel, now Human Resources and Affirmative Action) appointed the Troubled Employee Research and Study Committee. Chaired by Carol Surles, the committee worked for a year studying the various behavioral-medical problems that interfere with job performance and drafted a proposal for a troubled employee program. In response to the recommendations of the committee, Staff and Union Relations assigned a half-time personnel representative in July 1975 to implement and coordinate an employee referral program. Despite the fact that this early attempt was informal and unpublicized, the response was great enough to indicate the need for an official, highly publicized program. As a result, FASAP was formed in 1977 and designated as the internal, university employee assistance program.</p>
      <p>FASAP assists individuals who have or may potentially have problems associated with alcohol, drug abuse, family or child-related concerns, financial or legal difficulties, emotional concerns, medical behavioral problems, and job dissatisfaction or career concerns. Services are available to all university faculty, staff, retirees, family members, and/or their operating units and supervisory personnel. Program services include confidential consultation and diagnosis, referral, and follow-up. Additionally FASAP provides crisis intervention services, and training or consultation to administrators and supervisors in identifying and referring individuals whose personal problems are affecting work performance and unit morale. Individuals may go to FASAP at any time or be suggested to seek FASAP assistance by a friend, co-worker, or supervisor.</p>
      <p>The Ann Arbor campus has a central campus office and a medical center office. The medical campus office opened in September 1986. FASAP counselors are available to assess and refer individuals to the variety of services both within the university community and to private agencies outside of it. Dearborn and Flint campuses have on-site offices. Designated persons within the counseling services departments have responsibility for providing the range of FASAP services at these locations.</p>
      <p>The FASAP office was critical to the Task Force on Alcohol and Other Drugs which was appointed by President Duderstadt in 1989. Keith Bruhnsen, manager of FASAP, was called upon to coordinate the project. The task force was charged with developing a university-wide plan for dealing with the problems caused by alcohol and other drugs. In May 1991 it published its report, " <title render="italic">A University Community Approach to Alcohol and Other Drugs Phase One Report of the University of Michigan Task Force on Alcohol and Other Drugs: The Rollicking Crew" Revisited</title>," and in 1992 the University of Michigan Initiative on Alcohol and Other Drugs was established to implement its recommendations. Dr. Frederick Glaser, co-chair of the task force, was selected to head the Initiative, and Keith Bruhnsen was deeply involved in the new organization's work.</p>
      <p>Originally, FASAP was administered by the Office of Staff Benefits. In 1990, it was moved to the Personnel Support and Development Office of Personnel Administration, now a part of the reconfigured Human Resources and Affirmative Action Office.</p>

      <p>The records of the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FASAP) document the approach taken by the university to assist employees troubled by medical, financial, family or work-related problems. The records span the years 1973-1996, with the bulk of the materials covering 1980-1993. Documentation details the evolution and development of FASAP and its involvement in larger substance abuse issues across campus. The records are divided into six series: Historical Files, Administrative Files, Collected Reference Materials, Correspondence, Task Force on Alcohol and Other Drugs, and Initiative on Alcohol and Other Drugs.</p>

          <p>The Historical Files series contains documentation on the Troubled Employee Study Committee chaired by Carol Surles during 1973-1974. The recommendations of the study committee ultimately formed the basis of an employee assistance program which became FASAP. The folder "An Historical Overview of FASAP" is a compilation of the work of FASAP and its precursors from 1975 through 1981. The assembled documents include quarterly reports of activities, goals and objectives, and usage statistics. Other materials detail the development of FASAP through 1980.</p>

          <p>Detailed information on the operation of FASAP is housed in the Administrative Files Series. A number of activity reports and monthly statistical data are located within this series along with policy documents and procedure manuals. A 1985 annual report and a 1993 report on the first 15 years of FASAP provide good overviews of the scope of FASAP's work and the evolving types of cases and issues addressed by the staff. The establishment of a FASAP office on the medical campus is well documented and is supported by minutes of the FASAP Medical Center Advisory Committee. Monthly analysis reports of caseload data are available from 1977 to 1990. Some statistical information is also present for the Dearborn campus for 1980 and 1983 as well as the medical campus office for 1986-1988. The data in these statistical analyses typically include the type of problem, client job category, and referring source.</p>

          <p>The Collected Reference Materials series consists of brochures, flyers, and pamphlets that FASAP collected from Michigan agencies and companies that in some way relate to the FASAP program. The materials, dating from 1978 to 1989, are arranged into three categories: Employee Assistance Programs, Treatment Facilities, and Miscellaneous items. The Miscellaneous folder includes reports on drug testing in the work place, drug policies of specific companies, and newsletters.</p>

          <p>Correspondence dates from 1979 to 1994 and reflects the work of various FASAP coordinators and mangers. The correspondence also illuminates some of the policy issues developed and handled by FASAP. Both incoming and outgoing letters are found in this chronologically arranged series which includes correspondents from within the university as well as outside of the university setting.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files consist of files created and compiled by FASAP staff members and date from 1978 to 1996. Arranged alphabetically, the topical files include reports and minutes of various committees and task forces relating to alcohol, drug, and substance abuse issues (information on the Task Force on Alcohol and Other Drugs is located in a separate series). Notable topics include material on substance abuse among health care workers. This subject is profiled under several different folder headings, including "Chemical Dependency in Nurses," "House Officers and Medical Center Drug Testing," "Impaired Physicians," and "Medical Center Alcohol and Drug Testing." Training material illustrates efforts to teach supervisors how to identify and deal with employees in need of assistance. The file "Alcohol and Drugs in the Work Place Supervisory Handouts and Reference Materials" is a good example of training offered by FASAP.</p>
          <p>The topical files also document the reaction of the university to the problems of substance abuse among faculty and staff. Much of this documentation is found under the University of Michigan Substance Abuse Center (UMSAC). UMSAC was established in 1988 to coordinate substance abuse research and treatment activities. Several folders on UMSAC reflect the close association with FASAP as well as policy development, evaluation, and training to the university population.</p>
          <p>There is also documentation on non-university organizations dealing with substance abuse to which either FASAP itself, or individual staff members, belonged. Materials on the Association of Labor-Management Administrators and Consultant on Alcoholism (ALMACA), a Virginia based organization which promotes and assists in employee assistance programs, includes minutes and a position paper on alcohol and drug abuse in the work place. The Michigan Consortium on Substance Abuse Education (MCSAE) is an organization comprised of institutions of higher education. MCSAE documentation includes directories of substance abuse programs and faculty at Michigan colleges and universities. Finally, the "Washtenaw County Employer Substance Abuse Survey," contains information on how local businesses addressed the problem of substance abuse among their employees.</p>

          <p>The Task Force on Alcohol and Other Drugs series provides evidence of FASAP manager Keith Bruhnsen's contributions as coordinator of the task force appointed by President James D. Duderstadt in 1989. The 60-member task force consisted of faculty, staff and students. These files document the start up and progress of the task force. The committees subseries reflects the workings of the four major committees (Coordinating, Identification and Intervention, Policy, and Prevention and Education) and include minutes, reports, and transcripts from public hearings. The task force's final report and recommendations are found within this series. The Task Force on Alcohol and Other Drugs led to the establishment of the Initiative on Alcohol and Other Drugs.</p>

          <p>The Initiative on Alcohol and Other Drugs series is divided into four subseries. The first subseries, Administration, contains the records of the Initiative's staff meetings, as well as meetings of two bodies established to oversee the Initiative's efforts: the Policy Council and the Program Council. This series also contains records from the Initiative Transition Team, an internal group which met to analyze progress in reaching the goals set for it by the recommendation of the Task Force on Alcohol and Other Drugs. The second subseries, Phase I Activities, documents efforts to conduct a university-wide survey on attitudes towards drugs and alcohol, establish policies for dealing with alcohol and other drugs, and explore ways to monitor the effects of alcohol and other drugs on the university community. The third subseries, Phase II Activities, contains records of the Initiative's efforts to "address the more fundamental and longer range issue of the implications of the use of alcohol and other drugs in society" (memo, 9-5-1990, Folder: Initiative Transition Team.) This subseries is arranged alphabetically, and consists largely of records documenting contacts with various groups within the university to collect relevant information about the affect of alcohol and other drugs on their activities. The fourth subseries, Topical Files, is arranged alphabetically and consists of materials relating to subjects such as the problems of alcohol and other drugs in society at large, the efforts of other universities to address similar issues, support and treatment groups for alcoholics, as well as background files on issues relating to the law and insurance.</p>
