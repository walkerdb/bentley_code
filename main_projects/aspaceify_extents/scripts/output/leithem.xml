      <abstract>Emmett Leith (1927 - 2005), former Professor of Engineering at the University of Michigan, is known as one of the fathers of holography for his advances in 1963 that made the industry possible. He was a well-regarded teacher. The Leith papers span his entire professional career and include background information, articles, teaching and presentation materials, topical and chronological research files (notes, reports, and illustrations).</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Emmett Leith was born in Detroit, Michigan on March 12th, 1927. He received his bachelors (1950) and masters (1952) in physics from Wayne State University before beginning work as a Research Associate at the University of Michigan-affiliated Willow Run Laboratories in 1954. Through his research on side-along-radar (SAR) and with the assistance of Juris Upatnieks he was able to revive the long forgotten field of holography. Holography was originally developed by Dennis Gabor in 1947. However Gabor's process was hindered by a twin image and his research was eventually abandoned. In 1963 Leith and Upatnieks where able to eliminate the twin image and, with the assistance of the newly available laser, able to create stunning three dimensional images.</p>
      <p>Leith continued to research in the field of holography and eventually focused much of his time on applying holography to imaging through biological tissue. Leith was a prolific writer who wrote for a variety of journals. In addition to his research in holography Leith became a spokesman for the field and was often asked to speak and write on the field of holography as a whole in addition to his own work.</p>
      <p>Leith became an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering in 1963, a full professor in 1966, and the Schlumberger Professor of Engineering in 1981. He was well regarded by his students as an excellent teacher with a profound love for the subjects he taught and dedication to his students. Leith died on December 23, 2005, at the age of 78, just before his retirement was to become effective at the end of the year.</p>

      <p>The Bentley Historical Library received the materials in this collection through two accessions. The first came from Emmett Leith himself in 2000. The second came from the University of Michigan, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2006. The collection is comprised of five series: Background; Articles, 1959-2006; Teaching, 1966-2004; Research; and George Stroke. The materials were received with very little apparent order. Consequently, the series and subseries are artificial with the exception of the Articles Series which, for the most part, was well organized.</p>

          <p>The Background series (1 linear foot) contains materials that are descriptive of Leith and his career, including his CV. Notable in the series is a scrapbook containing newspaper articles in which Leith is mentioned. Many of the articles were printed around the time when Leith's advances in holography were becoming known to the public. This series contains photographs of Leith with various individuals, including some of Leith early in his career. Also included in this series is a recount by Upatnieks of his work with Leith in holography.</p>

          <p>Articles, 1959 - 2006 (2.3 linear feet) consists of four files of Leith's own writings. The first three files were arranged and named by Leith. The first, Radar Lab - Reprints, is named after the research group he worked in at Willow Run laboratories. Much of his work at this time was not published due to classification and so is not represented in this file. This was the time period when Leith and Upatnieks made their first major discoveries in holography. The second file, Technical Papers, 1971 - 2006 contains the bulk of his intellectual output. Leith divided this collection of papers into four volumes. Each of these volumes begins with a hand written contents list that numbers all the articles in that volume with their title and primary contributors. The Non Technical Papers, 1959-1990 has no further divisions and does not include a written contents list. The articles in this file are written for a wide range of expertise. Some are "popular" articles for the general public and others are very technical articles written for those with an engineering background who may not have much knowledge of optics or holography. The Miscellaneous file consists of unsorted articles and essays which Leith had not included in either of the other three categories. Many of them do not seem to have been published and some were probably written as texts for his students. Also included in this series is a List of Publications, June 5, 1984 compiled by Leith, although it is not comprehensive.</p>

          <p>Research, 1954-2005 (5 linear feet) is divided into two subseries: Topical and Chronological. Topical file folders were often named by Leith after a research project, a colleague or advisee, a paper, or an event and are arranged alphabetically. There is little consistency about what forms of material are housed within a given topical file. They are often combinations of hand written notes, drafts or reprints of his own or other's articles, reports, drawings, holograms, transparencies, and correspondence. Some files are much larger than the rest. Two large files are the "Navy Reports" file (projects sponsored by the Navy specifically) and the "ARO - AF" file (projects primarily sponsored by the Army Research Office) and consist mainly of reports written for the respective units. The final file in the subseries contains a run of correspondence from when Leith worked at the Willow Run Laboratories. Another folder of note, "Images," contains a variety of images including viewgraphs and hologram transparencies. The Chronological subseries consists mostly of planning and group meeting notes with no distinct project association but was kept chronologically, often with a running page enumeration.</p>

          <p>Teaching, 1966-2004 (2.5 linear feet) comprises samples of material documenting Leith as a professor and mentor to students and an instructor of professionals. The ECE 575 / EECS 535: Optical Information Processing subseries (the course number changed from ECE 575 to EECS 535 around 1985) serves to document the materials Leith used in the instruction of upper level university students. It was chosen for retention due to its comprehensiveness compared to other available teaching materials. Notably absent, however, are the visual aids Leith often used in teaching (although they were often reproduced in the "course notes"). Continuing Education (Summer Short Courses) subseries documents some of Leith's instruction of professionals in the form of course notes, evaluations, and descriptions. The Presentations and Lectures subseries is a collection of texts, notes, or transcripts for some of the presentations given by Leith in a variety of venues. The Thesis and Dissertation Acknowledgements are photocopies Leith kept in his office of the title page and acknowledgement sections of thesis and dissertations in which he is mentioned by name in the acknowledgement.</p>

          <p>The George Stroke, series (1 linear foot) was referred to by Leith as his "Stroke file." George Stroke was a colleague with whom relations were very strained in regards to claims about holographic research. Leith kept the file as a record of all his dealings with Stroke. The series consists primarily of correspondence with colleagues and copies of articles. The series has been left unprocessed.</p>
