      <p>Triangle Foundation is a Detroit-based civil rights organization whose mission is "to promote equality and to secure freedom from violence, intimidation and discrimination for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons throughout Michigan."</p>
      <p>The Triangle Foundation began as part of the Michigan Organization for Human Rights or MOHR. The mission of this organization was to promote the education, awareness and understanding of the lives of gay men and lesbians. In 1983 the MOHR Foundation was created to receive tax deductible contributions The Lesbian Gay Foundation of Michigan was formed in 1990 when MOHR and the MOHR Foundation separated. Finally, in 1991, the Lesbian Gay Foundation of Michigan changed its name to Triangle Foundation. The pink triangle was the badge which homosexuals were required to wear in Nazi Germany and in the Nazi concentration camps. It is now an internationally recognized symbol of gay and lesbian oppression and resistance.</p>
      <p>The new Triangle Foundation chose Jeffrey Montgomery as its President; he was later hired as executive director of the organization. Other important figures in the establishment and growth of the organization were Henry Messer and John Monahan.</p>
      <p>The Triangle Foundation has a number of ongoing advocacy and legislative lobbying projects: Anti-Violence Project, Human Rights Project, Education, Speakers Bureau, Professional Trainings, Direct mail, Literature &amp; publications, Legislative education/policy, Private Sector policy, Media activism, and Out-state/rural organizing.</p>
      <p>The Triangle Foundation is a also founding member of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), which publishes a national survey of hate violence against GLBT people. The Foundation's major contribution to this effort is in compiling statistics from incident reports in the state of Michigan and contributing to the annual "Anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Violence" report. This report provides data about the type and extent of violence that is occurring against GLBT crime victims in the United States. The Foundation also works with the GLBT community about the importance of reporting these hate crimes so that statistics can be compiled. Once an incident has been reported, the Foundation can assist the victim by acting as an advocate until the situation is resolved. In many cases, Triangle is the only source of such support.</p>
      <p>The Human Rights Project is a referral service provided to put victims in touch with attorneys throughout Michigan who can provide needed legal advice and representation. Victims can also be referred to counselors and other support services.</p>
      <p>The Foundation takes every opportunity to educate the public on GLBT issues. The Triangle Speakers Bureau gives presentations on topics such as civil rights, hate violence and hate crime legislation and other legal issues to many school groups, organizations and conferences. It offers training on lobbying techniques involvement in electoral politics and legislative reform, working effectively with the media, and dealing with homophobia in the workplace. Their publications and mailings also reflect these issues.</p>
      <p>Media activism is another major function of the Triangle Foundation. Staff monitor and respond to media coverage of relevant issues and offer training to members of the media on accurate coverage of GLBT issues. Triangle provides instruction to their own leaders to effectively work with the media and alerts the media to important events and developments in the GLBT community.</p>
      <p>A final major function of Triangle Foundation is the "Out-State" organizing. This organizing is focused on getting out into the community and establishing a positive presence at local events, beyond the urban centers in southeast Michigan. It also encourages people to be "out" (of the closet) into their own communities and active in local government and community activities.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series consists of 3/4" U-matic videocassette tapes. Most of the tapes are locally produced for cable television. The Lambda Digest is a thirty-minute newsmagazine which covered items in the local and national news of interest to the gay and lesbian community. Other items in the series are interviews with members of local and national gay and lesbian organizations; as well as one tape of a public service announcement by the actress Amanda Bearse, which she made for National Coming Out Day (1994). This series covers the period 1989 to 1994, although a few tapes are undated. The tapes are in good condition. There is no indication that these tapes were produced or funded by the Triangle Foundation.</p>

          <p>The Civil Rights series documents the activities of Triangle in its efforts to ensure equal rights for gays and lesbians. Throughout this and subsequent series there are numerous news clippings. Their presence is evidence of the media watchdog function of the Triangle Foundation. The clippings provide accounts of news stories of interest to the LGBT community, as well as documenting how the media covered topics of concern to the organization. Of particular interest in this series is the Education and Civil Rights Task Force subseries, as well as the Michigan Advisory Committee subseries. The former was a division of Triangle, formed to combat ballot initiatives in Michigan which would harm the civil rights of gays and lesbians. The Michigan Advisory Committee advised the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on hate crimes, and Triangle testified before the committee in 1991. The subsequent report of the Committee was rejected by the U.S. Commission, and it was Triangles' belief that the rejection was due to the inclusion of a chapter on hate crimes against the gay/lesbian community. The series in general covers the period 1992-1998.</p>

          <p>The Hate Crimes series contains information on another aim of Triangle: to document incidents of hate crimes against GLBT persons. The files on the annual news conference (during which the annual statistics were released) and on the Community Watch Coalition (CWC) are particularly rich. The CWC is another offshoot of Triangle, which in turn had a project entitled "Copwatch," which concerns gay and police relations, and police training in understanding gay hate crimes. The case files reflect the legacy of Michigan as a sodomy and "gross indecency" state. The series covers the period 1991-1999.</p>

          <p>The Legislative/Political series contains materials related to another focus of Triangle: legislative education and monitoring legislation. It contains correspondence with legislators at the state and national level, including a petition to Michigan Governor John Engler to amend the Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act (1994). There is also information on the Ethnic Intimidation Act, the state's hate crime law, which does not mention sexual orientation. The topic of gays in the military is documented in a series of files. Much of this was sparked by the presidential campaign of then-Governor Bill Clinton. There is a file on Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, with whom the Triangle Foundation had a good relationship (there are several 8x10 color photographs of Mayor Archer with Jeff Montgomery and John Monahan of Triangle). This series covers the period 1990-1998.</p>

          <p>The Religion series contains materials on religious organizations that either worked with the Triangle Foundation, provided support for the gay/lesbian community, or that opposed homosexuality as a sin. The materials on the religious right range from material published by opposition groups such as People for the American Way, as well as materials produced by members of the religious right. The materials contain correspondence, news clippings, newsletters and other publications. There are two 8x10 black-and-white photographs in the file on the Bishop's Commission on AIDS. The series covers the period 1988-1999.</p>
