      <p>The University of Michigan Computing Center was established as an independent center within the Horace Rackham School of Graduate Studies on July 1, 1959. Prior to this it was part of the Statistical and Computing Laboratory of the Graduate School. In 1965 the Computing Center was placed under the Vice President for Research. With the appointment of the Vice Provost for Information Technology and creation of the Information Technology Division (ITD) in 1985, the Computing Center was made a unit of ITD.</p>
      <p>The function of the Computing Center was to provide computing services for the academic and research needs of the entire university campus, to operate and maintain mainframe computing facilities, and to engage in research and development of computer software and hardware systems. In the early 1980s, the Computing Center became involved in the introduction of personal computers on campus and the development of local, regional and national computer networks.</p>
      <p>Dr. Robert F.C. Bartels was named the first director of the Computing Center, serving until 1978. Aaron Finerman became director in 1978 and was succeeded in turn by Carolyn Autrey-Hunley in 1986. The Computing Center's first facility was located in remodeled space in the North University Building at 1205 North University Avenue. The Center moved to a new facility on North Campus in 1971. The North University Building (NUB) location became the first of a number of public access computing sites operated by the Computing Center.</p>
      <p>The first digital computing machine at the university was built by the Willow Run Laboratory under sponsorship of the Wright Air Development Center of the U.S. Air Force. The MIDAC (Michigan Digital Automatic Computer) became operational in 1953. It was the second such computer in the Midwest and was used primarily for government sponsored research, with only limited access for instructional use. Nevertheless, a number of faculty and graduate students did receive training on the MIDAC. Under the direction of Professor John Carr, several automatic programming systems were developed for the MIDAC, including MAGIC (Michigan Automatic General Integrated Computation) and EASIAC (Easy Instruction Automatic Computer.) This marked the beginning of a tradition of operating system and programming language development at the university. The Air Force, which retained ownership of MIDAC, removed the machine from campus in 1958.</p>
      <p>In 1956 the university administration approved the installation of an IBM 650 in the Statistical Research Lab in the Rackham Building under the auspices of the IBM Educational Contribution Program. Statistical Lab staff, led by Bruce Arden and Bob Graham developed the Generalized Algebraic Translator (GAT) programming language and compiler, a relatively easy to use language that greatly expanded the user community on campus and at other sites where it was installed. The IBM 650 was in service at the Statistical Lab through September of 1959.</p>
      <p>An ad hoc committee chaired by university Vice President William Stirton was formed in 1956/57 to consider the need for a major computational facility for instructional and research use. The recommendations of this committee led to the establishment of the Computing Center. In 1957 the committee considered bids from IBM, Univac Division of Sperry Rand, and Burroughs for the installation of a new, more powerful computer. The IBM bid was accepted and a model 704 was delivered to the North University Building in July, 1959 and became operational in August.</p>

      <p>The Computing Center staff developed operating systems and languages for each of the machines including MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder) for the 704, 709 and 7090 series as well as the UM Executive System (UMES) for the 7090. The limited memory available to the IBM 7090 and the high cost of its operation demanded the use of "batch processing," in which programs were run immediately after one another with minimal human intervention. Batch processing ensured that the university's expensive computing resources were used cost-effectively, but did so at the price of requiring users to wait hours or days for project results. However, in 1966 new developments in virtual memory architecture inspired the staff of the Computing Center to draft a proposal for a terminal-oriented, timesharing operating system that would allow users to interact with their programs and receive immediate results.1</p>
      <p>The Computing Center staff took their timesharing proposal to IBM which led, after a period of close collaboration, to the development of a one-of-a-kind IBM System 360/66M computer ('M' for 'Michigan'). The Computing Center entered into an agreement with IBM to assist in development of the Time Sharing System (TSS), an operating system that would take advantage of the multi-processing features of the 360/67. When project delays prevented IBM from delivering software to support the new hardware's timesharing capability, Michael T. Alexander and Donald W. Boettner led the development of an in-house timesharing operating system, the Michigan Terminal System (MTS). The low level supervisor or kernel of the system was the UM Multiprogramming Supervisor (UMMPS) which controlled the execution of multiple instances of "job programs," one of which was MTS which made timesharing possible.</p>
      <p>MTS was released to the UM campus in May, 1967 and the first remote connections were established at the Dearborn campus in 1969. The Computing Center's facilities in the North University Building were remodeled and expanded several times between 1959 and 1968 to accommodate new machines and greatly increased demand for services. Construction of a new building on North Campus began in 1969 and the Computing Center moved to the new facility in April, 1971. The North University Building facilities were converted to a faculty/student computing site with remote terminal connections to the mainframe on North Campus. Other computing sites were later established at the Michigan Union and other campus locations. By 1970 the system could support 58 simultaneous users on nearly 200 terminals providing access to MTS on the UM campus and from other universities. While MTS had little difficulty responding to requests for 100,000 jobs per month or more, such demands were growing beyond the capacity of the IBM 360/67 computers on which it ran. The Computing Center preferred the superior speed, reliability, and lower cost of the compatible Amdahl 470V/6 computer. U-M was the first university to use the Amdahl computer, installing serial number P2 during the summer of 1975. Other universities soon migrated to Amdahl and these systems (470V/6, 470V/7, 470V/8, and 5860, running the MTS operating system) would remain a part of the UM computing infrastructure through the mid-1980s.</p>
      <p>In addition to the University of Michigan and the University of British Columbia, there were five other member institutions of the MTS Consortium: the University of Alberta, Wayne State University, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Simon Fraser University, and NUMAC ("Northumbrian Universities Multiple Access Computer," a collaboration among the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Durham University, and Newcastle Polytechnic). Each of the member institutions played a significant part in the development of MTS, particularly in the design, implementation, and testing of features and services. Other notable users of MTS included Michigan State University, Hewlett-Packard, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
      <p>In the early 1970s a parallel initiative, the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad (MERIT) linked the computer systems of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University. The MERIT network was independent of MTS, but in practice the two projects were closely associated, and the University of Michigan provided all hosting and staff support for the new network. By the late 1970s, MERIT had begun to expand to other Michigan universities as part of its mission to provide advanced and expensive computer resources to smaller institutions that could not otherwise afford them. Services provided by the MERIT network would include access to the Telnet network by 1976 as well as access to the internet in 1985. Communication processing technology developed for MERIT would lead to the creation of UMnet in 1983.</p>
      <p>MTS also provided innovative services. In 1975 graduate student Robert Parnes created CONFER, an early conferencing system for private electronic mail exchange, open or invitation-only group discussion on MTS and on other systems linked to MTS via the Merit network. Email service to remote users on other systems was added in September 1983 when MTS joined the MAILNET project, a joint effort by sixteen universities and EDUCOM (the precursor to EDUCAUSE). The increasing popularity of microcomputers in the early 1980s also led the Computing Center staff to develop programs which would allow the use of Apple II and IBM PC computers as terminals on the MTS system.</p>
      <p>The development of popular features, such as remote access from other networks, added to the growing demand placed on MTS by students and faculty. In 1985, a second system was secured for the increased use. This second system was named "UB" or "U-Blue" to distinguish it from the first system, which was retroactively designated "UM" or "U-Maize." A third MTS system was created for the UM Department of Human Genetics.</p>
      <p>By the 1980s, the introduction of personal computers led to a movement away from centralized, mainframe computing towards a more distributed computing environment. The increasing popularity of microcomputers coupled with other trends in computer technology during that time eventually led to the replacement of MTS largely by Unix-based networked servers with TCP/IP support for internet connectivity. Phase out of MTS, the heart of the university's academic computing system for more than two decades, began in the late 1980s and end-user support ended in June 1996; the UM systems themselves were shut down on May 30, 1997. The last member of the MTS Consortium to have an MTS system in operation was Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which shut down its system in June 1999.</p>
      <p>In 1985 the Computing Center was merged into the Information Technology Division, a new unit created in 1984 to focus on network development, provide support for microcomputers, and orient users to a networked environment. In what was considered a "major appointment," Douglas Van Houweling became University of Michigan vice provost for information technology, a newly created position, and the head of the new unit.</p>
      <p>ITD's organizational structure in 1985 included the Computing Center, the Office of Administrative Systems, the Center for Information Technology Integration, and the Office of Instructional Technology. Carolyn Autrey-Hunley served as Computing Center director after Aaron Finerman's retirement in 1986 until 1990, when Computing Center functions were absorbed into a new ITD administrative structure made up of the following units: Resource Administration, Networking Systems, Research Systems, Instructional Technology Systems, and the Assistance and Support Center.</p>

      <p>Records of the Computing Center have been received in three major accessions ? 1994, 1996, and 2011. Arrangement of the records in each accession is intended to reflect complimentary series. Each accession is described separately, and there is some overlap between the two.</p>
      <p>The 1994 accession of the Computing Center record group primarily documents the founding and operation of the University of Michigan Computing Center from 1959 to 1987. It also includes some information on computing activities at the university prior to the founding of the Computing Center, dating back as far as 1952. Researchers should note that there is overlap between this accession and 1996 accessions. There is also overlap with the Information Technology Division record group, particularly after 1986 when ITD was created to bring together the Data Systems Center and the Computing Center under the purview of the Provost for Academic Affairs.</p>
      <p>The records, which were in a very disorganized state when accessioned into the archives, were arranged into eight series: Historical Files, Administrative Records, Topical File, MTS (Michigan Terminal System), Word Processing Project, Vendors, and Photographs.</p>
      <p>The 1996 accessions from the Computing Center add 32 feet of additional material to the record group. The records bring (in various formats) both breadth and depth to the earlier accessions, filling in major gaps and adding new documentation. The records are organized into nine series, generally corresponding to the arrangement of the earlier accession: Administrative Records, Computer Files, MTS (Michigan Terminal System), Merit Network, MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), Word Processing Project, Vendors, Software Contracts, and Topical Files. Researchers should note that there is considerable overlap between Computing Center accessions and the Information Technology record group, particularly between 1985 and 1990 and especially for financial material and major committees.</p>

The UCCPU files in the Computing Center record group cover the years from 1979 to 1983. (Minutes for the years 1965 to 1977 are located in a separate UCCPU record group at the Bentley Library. See finding aid for "University of Michigan. University Committee on Computer Policy and Utilization.") The minutes document both broad policy questions and reviews of requests by university units to purchase particular computing systems. The Computing Center record group also includes files of several UCCPU subcommittees: Computer Ethics, 1979; Computing Center Priorities, 1979-1980; Micro-Computer Policy, 1983; and Word Processing, 1980.</p>
            <p>Committee "A" was established by director Aaron Finerman in 1978 to serve as the Computing Center's primary internal management committee and was composed of senior computing center administrators. The files, 1978-1986, (1.2 linear feet) include minutes, agendas, reports and correspondence. The Advisory Committee consisted of senior Computing Center staff plus six to eight other staff members who served on a rotating basis. The committee's function was to advise the director on operation of the Computing Center. The records, 1978 to 1980, include some long-range planning materials. The Executive Committee was created in 1959 to serve as the Computing Center's governing board. It was composed of the Computing Center director and university faculty and administrators. The committee files, dating from 1959 to 1966 and 1979 to 1985, provide an overview of Computing Center activities. The Review Committee files, 1984-1986, contain minutes, reports and correspondence relating to the university's review of the Computing Center.</p>

          <p>A number of subject oriented files have been brought together in the Topical File series (3 linear ft., 1960-1986). The series, which is arranged alphabetically, includes files on a variety of internal and external projects, various ad-hoc committees and task forces, and Computing Center relationships with other university units. Among the more significant are: Computing Center Policy, Ford Foundation "Computers in Engineering" Grant, MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), MIDAC (Michigan Digital Automatic Computer), Software Engineering Institute, and Supercomputing.</p>
          <p>The Computing Center Policy files, 1979-1985, contain documentation on the development of the "Conditions of Use," "Authorization and Charge," and other policies. The Ford Foundation Grant file provides information on a major grant to the College of Engineering, which funded a three year project to teach engineering faculty about digital computing and develop course curricula incorporating use of computing technology. The project was directed by professors Bruce Carnahan and James O. Wilkes.</p>
          <p>MAD files, 1961-1964, include correspondence relating to development of MAD and training material for use of MAD and UMES (University of Michigan Executive System), an early operating system developed for use on the IBM 704 in cooperation with General Motors. The MIDAC file consists of a photocopy of a brochure on the university's first computer, which was developed by the Willow Run Laboratory in 1952.</p>
          <p>The Software Engineering Institute was a proposed collaborative software development laboratory among several Big Ten Universities. The Institute, which ultimately was not established, was in large part a response to the software development needs of the federal government's "Star Wars" program. The files, 1983-1984, offer some insight into the perceived capabilities of programmers and scientists at the Computing Center and the university, and more broadly on the feasibility and reliability of "structured" and "automatic" programming.</p>
          <p>The Supercomputing Files, 1983-1985, are divided into: General, Institute for Computational Studies (ICS), and NSF Supercomputing Sites. The General files include correspondence and reports on the supercomputing needs of the university and proposals for developing such capabilities on campus. The ICS files document the Computing Center's participation in a supercomputing consortium based at the University of Colorado. The NSF Supercomputing Site files document the university's unsuccessful effort to be named host for one of the six National Science Foundation Supercomputing Sites. The records include the UM proposal, comments of the review panel, and material on the NSF site visit.</p>
          <p>Other items of interest include documentation on the Computing Center relationships with the Medical School, College of Literature, Science and Arts, and the Institute for Social Research, an Executive Officers Seminar on the Impact of Computing on Research, a 1985 report on High Speed Computational Facilities at the university, and files on the development of UMNet, the campus computing network.</p>

          <p>The MTS (Michigan Terminal System) series (1 linear ft., 1970-1986) provides documentation on the development and marketing of the MTS operating system developed by the Computing Center. For the most part the files are administrative rather than technical. The General files include several reports on MTS development and current features. The Licensing and the Marketing Plans files provide some indication of the range of clients who purchased or considered purchasing MTS. The Workshops subseries provides some information on the implementation of MTS code and features. The workshops were held annually for administrators and programming staff of the six MTS Group universities. The files for individual workshops vary from little more than schedules, to reports on individual sessions, to complete transcripts.</p>

          <p>The Word Processing Project series (.25 linear ft., 1978-1983) documents a project headed by Bernard Galler to investigate the possibilities for text processing on computers. Portions of the project were conducted jointly with IBM. The files, which consist primarily of correspondence and reports, illustrate some of the early thinking on the development of word processing capabilities on mainframe systems and personal computers.</p>

          <p>The Vendors series (1.75 linear ft., 1958-1984) provides information on the purchase, installation and operation of computing equipment and the Computing Center's relations with computer companies. There are substantial records for each of the major vendors: Apple, Amdahl, Apollo, Burroughs, and IBM.</p>
          <p>The IBM and Amdahl subseries are the most significant. They include separate files for each of the major machines or systems installed by the Computing Center. The files for a machine may include information on its purchase, various reports and statistics on usage, and material relating to its discontinuance and resale. The IBM material also includes files on the Time Sharing System (TSS) development. IBM began developing TSS for use on its 360/67 machine. The Computing Center was a partner in some phases of TSS development. When IBM's development efforts proved slower than expected, Computing Center staff continued development work on a time shared operating system that became MTS. Significant files include the Code Transfer Agreement between UM and IBM and several reports comparing TSS, MTS and other time sharing systems.</p>
          <p>The Amdahl records document the Computing Center's conversion to Amdahl mainframes in the mid 1970s. Files include a transcript of the Regents' meeting at which the Computing Center argued for the purchase of the Amdahl 470/V6 machine over a Burroughs computer. The Burroughs files also include information on this purchase.</p>

ITPC, a ten member advisory panel was formed in 1987 as a reconstituted Computing Policy Committee (CPC), with a tightened focus for advising on major functions: strategic direction, priority setting and policy recommendation. ITAC initiated that same year, was charged with developing the design for and recommending implementation tactics for a university-wide, comprehensive information technology architecture. Documents containing valuable background information on issues scheduled for deliberation often supplement committee files, which are mainly comprised of minutes, agendas, and correspondence.</p>

            <p>The Organization and Planning subseries is important for documenting internal studies, reorganizations and methodologies for long-term planning. "Topical Task Force Reports," for example, summarize in 1990 statistics support, scientific computation, applications in use, electronic mail, the evolution of MTS (Michigan Terminal System), the university library's online bibliographic system (MIRLYN), staff morale, and staff training and development.</p>

          <p>The MTS (Michigan Terminal System) series (13.5 linear ft., 1968-1996) is comprised of three subseries: Distributions, Topical Files, and Workshops. The heart of the series is the distribution documentation (as the term documentation is used in the computing world) for the highly regarded operating system developed at the University of Michigan. The material is arranged chronologically by version, beginning with version 1.0 in 1968 and concluding with 6.0 in 1988. Each distribution typically includes computer printouts that carry instruction for technical installation and instruction for operating the system. For some versions, the record group includes master magnetic tapes. Material is housed by size and format, and documentation for a single version may be found in more than one box. Workshop files are an important complement to distribution data, documenting the cooperative nature of MTS, which was one of the first networked development efforts ever undertaken. Workshops were held annually for administrators and programmers from eight universities in three countries to share information about MTS development and to jointly analyze new features. The files include papers, presentations, agendas and schedules. Also of note is a 1990 MTS user study. Its goal was to define the system not only in terms of CPU, disk storage, etc., but by how the community was actually using the system. The series also includes programming staff memoranda, draft manuals, and a 1991 document on the future of MTS. The later details requirements for moving into distributed computing and requirements for the transfer and migration of current services to new ones.</p>

          <p>The Merit Network series (1 linear ft., 1978-1989) includes eight folders of board of director and director advisory committee correspondence, minutes and agendas for 1979 to 1989; NSF (National Science Foundation) proposals, correspondence and background for 1986-1988; and miscellaneous organizational files. Researchers will find more extensive material about Michigan's Merit network, its management and re-engineering of the NSFNET backbone service (a collaboration with IBM and MCI) and further description of the evolution of the Internet which it helped pioneer, in the Information Technology Division (ITD) record group.</p>

          <p>The MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder) series (4 linear ft., 1960-1979) supplements, particularly with technical documentation, records from the earlier accession. The language, which provided a structure that fostered learning and teaching while also including the structure necessary for solving complex problems, was a key development in the evolution of computing at the university and broadly recognized as a major intellectual achievement. The records illustrate MAD's essential purpose -- to train large numbers of university students and to handle the large volume of university research problems in files of correspondence, developer and programmer notes, and reports and manuals. The series also includes three feet of MAD code printouts, some of which include penciled annotations.</p>

          <p>The Word Processing series (.5 linear ft., 1980-1982) adds further documentation to a Computing Center collaboration with IBM to develop text processing on computers. The three-year investigation was a $700,000 project, which was initiated with a conference to analyze the current state of the art in word processing techniques. It drew experts from across the United States. The records include background information, conference material, and advisory committee meeting minutes and notes.</p>

          <p>The Vendors series (1.5 linear ft., 1974-1992), arranged alphabetically, and Software Contracts series (2 linear ft., 1966-1992), also alphabetically arranged, together document associations with computer companies and the typical types of legal arrangements made with software producers. While associations with several major computer companies are represented in the Vendors series, a majority of the files in this second accession of the record group are IBM related, most significantly for the IFS (Institutional File System) collaboration, which was originally dubbed internally, "Strawman." Begun in 1988, and directed by Gregory Marks, deputy vice provost for information technology, IFS created an innovative computing environment for file storage and retrieval for workstations on campus (anticipated in the 1990s to be more than 30,000 machines). IFS served as a model for other universities and businesses linking heterogeneous mainframes, minicomputers and workstations running different operating systems. The records contain background, the development plan, status reports, meeting minutes and notes. There is some additional documentation for IFS in the CITI (Center for Information Technology Integration) files of the Topical Files series of this record group and more complete documentation in the Information Technology Division (ITD) record group (including detailed planning documents). Software was managed by Software Services, which had responsibility for operating systems, workstation support, applications and servers, and scientific computation. The Software Contracts files are mainly comprised of formal contracts defining conditions of use for a broad range of software.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series (4 linear ft., 1983-1992), arranged alphabetically, include records that reflect the Computing Center's relationships with other university units, the development of conferencing and an e-mail system, a movement into computer sales, the development of policy, and outreach to users. The most extensive documentation is for CITI (Center for Information Technology Integration), ITD's research / development unit that worked to develop joint projects with industrial partners and liaisons with key equipment suppliers. There are also several files from User Services, the ITD unit charged with education, documentation, user relations, consulting and local area networking. Files include a 1990 workshop, user surveys for 1986 and 1988, and a 1992 graduate school user survey.</p>

          <p>The MTS series contains digital surrogates (in PDF format) of documents already held at the Bentley Library as well as source code and documentation of the six full and the ten partial MTS distributions (and two redistributions) created between 1968 and 1988. The distribution documentation covers versions 1.0 to 6.0; distributions 1.0 through 3.1 supported the IBM S/360 Model 67, distribution 3.2 supported both the IBM S/360-67 and the IBM S/370 architecture, and distributions D3.3 through D6.0 supported just the IBM S/370 architecture and its extensions. The D6.0 distribution materials are suitable for the creation of an IPLable version of MTS based upon the version that was in use at the University of Michigan in 1996 shortly before MTS was shutdown. These files are accompanied by a labeled tape (lbltp) program that may be used to read and decode the MTS source code on Windows, Mac OS, and Unix computers. The scanned documents in the series include Computing Center memos, reference documents, MTS user manuals, and internal system documentation (used by system programmers).</p>
