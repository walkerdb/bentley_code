      <p>Since World War II there has been an evolution toward a division of knowledge into discrete fields, resulting in ever narrowing areas of scholarly interest and focus. The Institute for the Humanities at the University of Michigan was founded in 1987 partly in response to a recognized need for renewed dialogue across the disciplines. However, it was also developed because there was already evidence of increased intellectual overlap between and among fields in the humanities: literary scholars using the perspectives of anthropology to study the origins of myth; musicologists and art historians using economic history to explain how patronage affected stylistic development; classicists combining the methods of many disciplines in the quest for knowledge of the ancient world. James A. Winn, who was the center's first director, spoke to the synergistic nature of the Institute's mission: "We do not oppose specialization. Instead, we attempt to transcend it by challenging the expert researcher and the innovative theorist to think about their findings on a larger level, as they relate to other investigations in other disciplines, and to excel in original and innovative ways."</p>
      <p>The first executive committee, which was formed to assist an appointed director on policy and advise in the selection of internal and visiting fellows and associates, included faculty members from law, romance languages, Japanese studies, music, classics, and history. They, along with interim director John Knott, worked to set the stage for an exemplary interdisciplinary innovation in the humanities and the arts. After several years of planning, the Institute for the Humanities moved into a newly renovated suite of rooms in the Horace H. Rackham Building in September 1987.</p>
      <p>While the earliest years primarily focused on building the program, raising an endowment, and increasing the number of fellows, the Institute quickly became a widely recognized center for international scholarship. Under Winn's directorship, the Institute, in just a few years, realized every guiding principle originally envisioned and defined: encourage interdisciplinary discourse and activity; promote the innovative and controversial; build bridges between the creative and performing arts and the analytical work done by humanists; develop an undergraduate dimension; and make findings available to a broad audience. Winn promoted broad, collaborative, integrative teaching in the humanities. Unlike programs elsewhere, the UM initiative, from the start, included a vital teaching component. Fellows developed new pedagogical models for instruction, moved across departmental boundaries, and welcomed students of all levels in their courses.</p>
      <p>Institute programs continued to expand and develop. In addition to sponsored courses and mini-courses, key conferences and forums punctuated each term. (Until 1999, conference papers and other program components were oriented around an annual theme.) The Institute's commitment to fostering new connections between the settings in which scholars express themselves and the settings in which artists express themselves resulted in numerous performances each year in theatre, dance and music. Events were framed by panel discussions, brownbag lunches, and lectures.</p>
      <p>In 1990, the Institute incorporated into the dialogue the examination of intersections between scientific and humanistic thought. In that year, undergraduate science majors participated in discussions ranging from medical ethics and the behavioral differences among primates, to the implications of technological change for humanists. In 1991, the center innovatively reached out to alumni. A Humanities Camp was instituted. Alumni were invited to a spring weekend of seminars, field trips, lectures and informal gatherings - all oriented around the humanities and designed to showcase some of the best faculty and experiences available at the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>In 1997, as the Institute entered its tenth year, Tom Trautmann, a former fellow, became its second director. In a letter published in the 1996-1997 annual report, Trautmann reaffirmed the center's guiding purpose: "I believe strongly in the Institute's central mission of supporting a community of scholars, both faculty and students, engaged in the creation of knowledge in the humanities."</p>

          <p>The Administrative Records series, while slight (ca. .5 linear ft.), is important because it is currently the only source of information in the record group that is text-based. The most significant documentation is in several folders of year-end reports prepared by Institute sponsored fellows; a folder of exit interview notes is also informative. The latter, a 1991-1992 project designed to evaluate expectations, events, and services was also geared toward gathering recommendations from fellows. The series also includes a folder of applications from students, ca. 1992-1996. Four additional application folders hold correspondence and accompanying material from undergraduates applying for the Program in the Sciences and Humanities.</p>

          <p>The Audio-Visual series, consisting of rich and excellent documentation of lectures, speeches, conferences, and events, is arranged chronologically by year and then by two formats: VHS videotape and audio-cassette tape. Researchers should note that there might be overlap (that is, the same lecture or conference recorded and described in each format). Presenters, when known, are identified by field (discipline) and institution.</p>
          <p>The extent of the documentation varies from year to year. There is very little for 1987-1988 (Theatre and Society) and only the second semester is represented for 1988-1989 (Translation: Cultural Confrontation and Transformation). The years between 1989 and 1997 are well documented in recordings of conferences, forums, lectures, brown bags, and performances. Recent years, 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, contain only a few items.</p>
          <p>Researchers are reminded that printed material in the form of publications is described in a finding aid immediately following this one. A complete run of annual reports is a highly recommended source for further information, and for adding context to the audio-visual records. Here one can find, year-by-year, annual highlights, program schedules and notes, profiles of UM fellows and visiting fellows, and development activities.</p>
