        <emph render="bold">Evangeline Marie Lehman</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Evangeline Marie Lehman, American composer and singer, born in Northville, Michigan, May 16, 1896; died in Highland Park, Michigan, February 28, 1975.</p>
      <p>Lehman studied at the Oberlin Conservatory and then the Fontainbleau Conservatoire in France. In 1933, her oratorio <title render="italic">St. Therese de l'Enfant Jesus</title> won her a silver medal from the French ministry of Foreign Affairs. Many of her works such as her oratorio <title render="italic">St. Therese</title>, cantata <title render="italic">La Nuit de Noel</title> and her piano work <title render="italic">Southland Frolic</title> were performed in Paris, Uruguay, New York, San Francisco and Detroit. Lehman herself also appeared as a solo performer with major orchestras such as the Chicago Symphony, the Detroit Symphony, the Cleveland Symphony and leading orchestras in Europe.</p>
      <p>Apart from being a composer and singer Lehman was a dedicated teacher. She had a studio of private students in Highland Park, Michigan, and gave numerous workshops at various institutions. She wrote a few articles, all published in <title render="italic">Etude Magazine</title>, on the technique and art of singing as well as on art song writing.</p>
      <p>She was married to Maurice Dumesnil, a noted concert pianist. He was an ardent publicist of her music. He premiered many of her piano works and conducted the premier performance of the oratorio <title render="italic">St. Therese</title>. Dumesnil also translated many of her song texts into French.</p>
      <p>Lehman was well known in the Detroit area and received an honorary Degree of Doctor of Music from the Detroit Institute of Musical Arts. In addition Lehman and Dumesnil made many concert appearances together both in the United States and Europe.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Maurice Dumesnil</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Maurice Dumesnil, French pianist and conductor, born Angouleme, Charente, France, April 20, 1886; died Highland Park, Michigan, August 26, 1974.</p>
      <p>Dumesnil studied at the Paris Conservatory under Isidor Philipp and Claude Debussy. Following his graduation in 1905 Dumesnil began a concert tour of Europe. During World War I he served as an officer in the French Field Artillery Corps. Immediately after his military service Dumesnil began concert tours of South America and served as an orchestral conductor in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Dumesnil's first American tour was in 1927 at which time he brought Frederick Chopin's piano to the United States for a six month coast to coast tour. Because Dumesnil had been a student of Debussy he became known for his masterful interpretations of Debussy's piano works.</p>
      <p>In 1931 Dumesnil married the American singer and composer Evangeline Lehman. However, because of Lehman's career plans the wedding was kept secret until 1942. At that time Dumesnil and Lehman had returned to the United States and Dumesnil wished to become an American citizen. He was told that his naturalization would be simplified if he were married to an American in the United States. So, Dumesnil and Lehman were married again in Kansas City and Dumesnil's application of United States citizenship was accepted.</p>
      <p>In addition to Dumesnil's extensive teaching and touring he was well known as an interpreter of Debussy. Not only was his musical interpretation of Debussy's work considered valuable but he also published two volumes on Debussy. In 1933 he wrote <title render="italic">How to Teach and Play Debussy</title> and in 1940 he wrote <title render="italic">Claude Debussy, Master of Dreams</title>. Dumesnil also had a regular column in <title render="italic">Etude Magazine</title>.</p>
      <p>Dumesnil enjoyed a wide and varied musical career and was well known and respected as both a performer and teacher.</p>

      <p>The Lehman/Dumesnil collection is really two collections, but because of their marriage as well as their close professional association, their papers have been kept together. The collection has two series: Evangeline Lehman and Maurice Dumesnil. There are also three envelopes of photographs on both individuals. Included are portraits, candid snapshots, and photos of concert performances.</p>
