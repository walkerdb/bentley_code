      <p>The Ladies Literary Club of Ypsilanti (LLC) is an outgrowth of the Ladies Library Association of the same city. At a board meeting of that Association in May of 1878, Mrs. Daniel (Sarah Smith) Putnam proposed the formation of a Literary Club. Mrs. Putnam had recently moved to Ypsilanti from Kalamazoo where she remembered "the effective work and good comradeship in the literary circles of that city and wished for Ypsilanti the same." Soon thereafter, officers were named and an agenda set. The first meeting of the LLC was held June 8 of the same year in the Library Association rooms. Mrs. Putnam was chosen President. The two societies worked closely together over the following years. Many women were members of both organizations. Subsequent meetings were held in members' homes . Later gatherings were held again in the Ladies Library. In 1906, the Red Cross room of the Masonic Temple became the site of the regular meetings. In 1914, the LLC purchased its own building which became its permanent clubhouse.</p>
      <p>The initial constitution of the LLC read "The object of this society shall be the mutual improvement of its members through the study of literature, art, science and the vital interests of the day." In the formative years, the focus of the LLC meetings was literary and cultural. Little time was spent on business matters. The first area of study was Africa, its resources and geography, its art and literature. Later attention was paid to European countries and their cultures.</p>
      <p>After the incorporation of the LLC with the National Federation of Women's Clubs in January of 1896 and the State Federation of Women's Clubs later that year, the LLC's commitment to public interest began. In that same year, perhaps in an attempt to strengthen the literary and cultural focus of the club, the Women's Study Club was formed as a branch of the LLC.</p>
      <p>In 1918 in order to enlarge the focus of the LLC, the following phrase was added to the constitution "(the object of this society is also) to serve as an energizing and uplifting force for all that makes for civic or community betterment." This broadening of the constitution reflects the "usefulness" of the organization and its attempts to shape public policy. How the organization of the LLC evolved is clearly represented in the minutes of the LLC's meetings. Reflecting the constitutional change, the regular meetings became much more concerned with the business of the organization and less concerned with cultural and literary matters.</p>
      <p>As the years went on, guest speakers took over the roll of preparing and supplying the lectures at meetings. This role was formerly played by members. In February of 1902, the first guest speaker addressed the Club. Programs began to be more varied. Debates were also held at meetings where both sides of an argument were argued. In February 1912, the first play was staged by the members. This began a yearly tradition. The first mention of an Entertainment and Program Committee can be found in 1899. The first "Music Committee" was listed in a program book of 1908.</p>
      <p>A look at some of the Committees which emerged and disappeared over the years affords a glimpse into the interests of this organization. A few of these committees include: "Art", "Education", "Flowers", "Citizenship", "Girl Scout Sponsors", "Sewing"(1943), "War Service-War Bonds"(1944-45), "Sarah George Scholarship", "Health"(1945), "Remembrance"(1957), "Legislation and Conservation"(1964), "City Beautification", "Cook Books"(1974), "Meals on Wheels"(1975).</p>
      <p>In 1914, the LLC altered its constitution, incorporated and included in its government a Board of Trustees. These changes allowed the organization to purchase a building which became their permanent clubhouse. Long known in the city as the Grant residence, this Greek revival style house was built in 1840. In 1928, in a celebration honoring the 50th anniversary of the LLC, the mortgage for the property was paid off and in the style of the day, the mortgage papers were "burned with the proper ceremony in the flames of a taper." In 1937,1950 and 1971 large improvements were made to the clubhouse. Over the years, the rooms have been rented out to other clubs for their meetings and gatherings. In October of 1965, the Michigan State Historical Commission presented to the Ladies Literary Building the first historical marker home designation in Ypsilanti. In April of 1971, the building was named to the National Register as the William H. Davis House.</p>
      <p>The Sarah George Student Loan fund was established in May, 1928. The Ypsilanti City Federation of Women's Clubs took over the fund from 1930-1938. It was then returned to the LLC and a committee was appointed to oversee its use. With the fund principal growing steadily, the Club decided to change it to a Scholarship fund in 1952. At this time it was stipulated that the recipient of this scholarship must be a girl graduate of Ypsilanti High School attending Eastern Michigan College.</p>

          <p>The Regular Meeting Minute Books series makes up the bulk of this record group. These handwritten record books document the meetings of the members from 1882 until 2005. Various speeches in the collection allude to the existence of record books from the first meetings which took place in 1878. Unfortunately, the collection as it stands today only encompasses minutes from the meetings of Sept. 1894 and forward to January 1989. Earlier small notebooks from 1882-1890 contain notes about some of the topics discussed at these meetings. They are not however meeting minutes. As the focus of the organization changed so did the format and records of its meetings. In April of 1943, some minutes of the executive board meetings, some treasury reports and some miscellaneous business meetings, began to appear in the same notebooks as the regular meeting minutes.</p>

          <p>Although an incomplete series, the membership and program books for the LLC run from 1910 to 1980. Each year lists officers, committees, the members and their addresses. Later books included the telephone numbers of the members and still later books added the year each member joined the organization. Printed also in this annual booklet is the monthly program schedule. In the early years, these books contained the constitution but in later years (1935, 1966, 1980) constitution booklets were published separately. Earlier constitutions can be found in the Regular Meeting Minute Books for Sept. 1894, Sept. 1900, June, 1901 and Sept. 1903.</p>
