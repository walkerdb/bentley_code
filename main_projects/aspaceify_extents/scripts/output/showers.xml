      <abstract>Paul Cutler Showers was a journalist and freelance writer. His writing and editing days began through involvement with <title render="italic">The Gargoyle</title> and <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title> while attending the University of Michigan. Showers's papers document his lengthy journalism career through his writings, recollections, and correspondence regarding the <title render="italic">Detroit Free Press</title>, the U.S. Army's <title render="italic">Yank Magazine</title>, and the <title render="italic">Sunday New York Times</title>. Family history played an important role in his life and can be seen through his collection of family photographs, recollections, and stories. In his later years, Showers became a prominent children's author known internationally for his work with the "Read and Find Out" series of science books for beginning readers.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Paul Showers was born on April 12, 1910 in Sunnyside, Washington. His parents returned to their home in Michigan a few years after his birth. His parents studied music at Michigan Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University) and returned to continue their careers: Frank Showers was a music teacher and choir director while M. Ethelyne Showers was a concert vocalist.</p>
      <p>After graduating high school, Paul attended the University of Michigan to study English and theater. He became involved with many campus activities including university theater productions and Michigamua. Paul also joined the staff of the <title render="italic">Michigan Daily</title> and the <title render="italic">Gargoyle</title>, becoming an editor for both. He also formed life-long friendships with fellow writers from these publications.</p>
      <p>Graduation in 1931 led to small theater roles throughout Michigan. His unsteady income was supplemented by freelance writing. In particular, he became the crossword puzzle creator for <title render="italic">Life</title>. At the time, <title render="italic">Life</title> was a prominent humor magazine and Paul designed extra large, witty puzzles full of puns and word plays. His time with <title render="italic">Life</title> ended when <title render="italic">Time</title> purchased the magazine and altered its focus.</p>
      <p>Paul's career as a copy editor "newspaper man" began in 1937 when he became a member of <title render="italic">The Detroit News</title>'s copy staff. After a few years, he relocated to New York City to work with the <title render="italic">New York Herald-Tribune</title>. His time with the newspaper was cut short when he entered the U.S. Army in 1942. While in the military, he began working for the Army's publication for soldiers, <title render="italic">Yank Magazine</title>. His involvement took him to Japan near the end of the war to work for the Okinawa branch of Yank. Diaries and recollections from this time describe his reactions to Japanese culture and post-war devastation of Japan.</p>
      <p>The end of the war brought Paul back to New York City where he began his career as a copy editor with the <title render="italic">New York Times</title> Sunday Department. He took on additional roles during his time with the paper including Travel Editor (1949-1961), editor of the <title render="italic">Sunday Magazine</title> (1961-1976), and writer of book reviews and "Times Talk" columns. Paul turned in his <title render="italic">New York Times</title> resignation on July 4, 1976, declaring his own independence from the newspaper life.</p>
      <p>Paul Showers was fascinated by children's process of learning reading skills. His curiosity led him to write Find Out by Touching in 1961. The book engaged children through scientific questioning and activities that were applied to their everyday life. The success of the book led him to author over twenty additional children's titles for the science series "Let's Read and Find Out." Paul Showers's clear, straightforward, and often humorous text paired with vivid illustrations combined to create award-winning books. The Bentley Historical Library holds little manuscript material regarding his activities as a children's author. However, his books, research materials, notes, publisher correspondence, production processes, and children's fan mail are located within the Kerlan Collection of the Children's Literature Research Collections at the University of Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Paul Showers studied his family and ancestors throughout his life. His research, correspondence, and recollections reveal his desire to learn about the roots of his family's conservative actions and beliefs. Paul rebelled against these constraints:</p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I have spent my life trying to free myself from the straightjacket of my childhood and adolescence. All other objectives have been secondary. But a life is not a solitary entity. It is only one segment of a continuity of genes with its inheritance of opinions and attitudes, ambitions and illusions that passes down from one generation to the next. (Paul Showers Papers, Box 1, Personal and Professional Papers - Biographical Material - Chronology and Memories)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>His introspective struggles are evident within his journals and correspondence. Descriptions vary between poetic entries and frank recollections. These personal admissions describe the clash between modern life and values rooted in 19th century America.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Paul Cutler Showers Papers document the life of a writer and editor, a University of Michigan alumni, an avid genealogist, a World War II veteran, and a prominent children's author.</p>
      <p>The arrangement of the papers maintains their original order of four series including Correspondence, Family History, Personal and Professional Papers, and Visual Materials. These are in alphabetical order except for the Personal and Professional Papers series, which follows its original chronological organization according to Paul Showers's career. The papers contain very little information about his work as a children's non-fiction author. This portion of his papers are within the Kerlan Collection, which is part of the Children's Literature Research Collections at the University of Minnesota.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence Series (1898-1999, 0.4 lin. ft.) contains letters between Paul Showers's and his relatives, friends, and prominent people. Correspondence between Paul Showers and his parents is especially rich with detail. Letters from Paul vividly describe his life, work, surroundings, and activities. His University of Michigan letters discuss early 1930s campus activities, theater productions, his studies, involvement with <title render="italic">The Gargoyle</title>, and his finances. Later correspondence describes life in Detroit and New York City including musical and theatrical productions, newspaper life, and the cities in general. His letters are descriptive and emotional, often filled with thoughtful self and family reflections.</p>
          <p>Family history was of particular interest to Paul Showers. His collection of letters from the Showers and Walker families document his quest to describe and explain his origins. He maintained many friendships throughout his life, documented by a number of correspondents within his papers. His work at the <title render="italic">New York Times</title> generated many admirers, whose letters of gratitude are located in the Prominent Individuals and Institutions folder. The folder contains letters from Dorothy Brett, Vladimir Nabokov, Frank Sullivan, M.F.K. Fisher, Leopold Stokowski, Edward Brecher, Bette-Jane Raphael, Emily Haan, Ludwig Bemelmans, and Vine Deloria, Jr.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials Section (1860-1991) contains photograph albums, loose photographs, a drawing, and one film. The 16mm film depicts a family reunion, most likely from the early 1930s. There are three photograph albums within the collection. Martha Kelly's Album is oversized with an ornate red velvet cover. It contains large images of the Kelly, Vandecar, Walker, Peck, and Smith families. The Kelly, Smith, and Vandecar Families Photograph Album is a smaller, blue book with images from around the 1870s. The Almont Album contains scenic postcards and snapshots of the Walker and Showers families, including early images of Paul Showers.</p>
          <p>The loose photographs mainly consist of family portraits. There are many images from both his mother's and father's families. There are also many portraits of Paul Showers from early childhood to late in life. Photographs in folders from <title render="italic">Yank</title>, <title render="italic">New York Times</title>, and (Detroit) <title render="italic">Free Press</title> show Paul Showers along with his colleagues and work environment. Also of note are the images of Okinawa taken during the final year of World War II.</p>
