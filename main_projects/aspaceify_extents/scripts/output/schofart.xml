      <abstract>The first classes in art at the University of Michigan were offered in 1906 by the Department of Architecture. In 1926, a program in decorative arts was housed in the College of Engineering and Architecture. Art evolved as a discipline, moving through the colleges of engineering and architecture to become the School of Art, an autonomous institution, in 1974. It became the School of Art &amp; Design in 1996. The records focus on the evaluation and review of the program in the 1970s and early 1980s during the budget crisis faced by the university. The records also contain minutes of the Executive Committee and the Faculty Committee, from the mid-1970s to 1999.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The origins of the School of Art can be traced back to classes taught in design by Emil Lorch in 1906 in the Department of Architecture. Thereafter, classes were added in drawing, with an emphasis on naturalism, followed by courses in painting. Originally, classes in art were aimed at students majoring in architecture, but as time passed, more and more non-architecture students enrolled in the various classes. In 1926, a program in decorative arts was housed in the College of Engineering and Architecture. After a faculty member conducted a survey in 1939 of art instruction at other universities, "the former emphasis on academic theory gave way to a more direct and creative approach in the content, method, and objectives of courses and their sequences; this was reflected in the appointment of new staff members with a more modern realistic point of view." (<title render="italic">Encyclopedic Survey</title>, Volume III, p. 1309) Classes in sculpture were added in 1949. In 1954, the differences in the teaching of art and architecture were formally acknowledged when art received departmental status in the College of Architecture and Design.</p>
      <p>The post-World War II boom in students led to a doubling in size of the art faculty between 1954 and 1960. The Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts degrees were established in 1959, and a program in Medical and Biological Illustration in 1964. Areas of concentration grew to include painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography, ceramics, weaving and fabric design, and jewelry and metalwork. The steadily increasing number of students resulted in a shortage of physical facilities, which eventually led to the construction of a new building to house both art and architecture on the university's North Campus. In 1974, the Department of Art became the School of Art, and, along with the College of Architecture and Design, moved into the new building.</p>
      <p>The School of Art faced its most serious crisis in 1982. As part of budget reducing measures in response to the financial crisis it faced, the university chose the schools of art, education, and natural resources to be reviewed for continuation or discontinuation. All three schools were continued, but with significant budget reductions. The School of Art budget was reduced by 18 percent.</p>
      <p>The school was renamed the School of Art &amp; Design in 1996, to better reflect the scope of the work. Its mission is to "educate and train artists and designers, to inform and influence others through the creation and dissemination of original ideas and visual work, and to provide a research environment that supports collaboration, integration of emerging technologies, and intellectual, and visual inquiry of the highest quality." (http://www.umich.edu/~provost) The graduate level interdisciplinary program in medical and biological illustration was one of only five in the nation accredited by the American Medical Association.</p>

      <p>The School of Art &amp; Design records are composed of six series: Topical Files, 1970-1987; Committees; Correspondence; Topical Files, 1980-2000; Visual Materials; and Website. There is a separate collection of printed material. The majority of the records document the years from 1975 to 1999, a crucial period in the school's history as it was formally established as a school in its own right and later experienced serious budget reductions.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files, 1970-1987 series (1.8 linear feet) comprises the initial collection of material prior to the 2008 accession. (A second Topical Files series, cover 1980-2000 and consists of material received in the 2008 accession). The Topical File series is arranged alphabetically. The history of the department/school from 1951-1974 can be found in the History- <title render="italic">Encyclopedic Survey</title> folder. For the years 1975-1985, the administrative, pedagogical, and intellectual life of the school can be traced through several files. The materials in the evaluation and planning files were prepared as part of a university-wide project, begun in 1973 and undertaken in response to the budget crisis of the 1970s. The project was designed to improve the processes by which the university evaluated its activities and programs, established priorities, and allocated its resources. The project had three phases: phase I, articulation of unit objectives and operations implications; phase II, evaluation of operations in light of objectives described in phase I; phase III, exploration of directions and alternative courses of action. The files here include faculty responses to phase I questionnaires regarding the goals and objectives of the school and reports and conference summaries. The records document the school's participation in phases I and II, but not in phase III. The National Association of Schools of Art (NASA) files include informative Self Study Reports prepared by the school in preparation for visiting NASA accreditation teams. The reports detail school objectives and goals, its organizational framework, financial resources, physical environment, curriculum, and student and faculty relationships. Finally, the Review files from 1982-1983 include the review committee's final report, which explores the quality and mission of the school in some detail. Clippings on student protests, and materials documenting the work of the Transition Team, which was responsible for finding ways to implement the recommended 18 percent budget reduction conclude the series.</p>

          <p>The Committees series (1.0 linear feet, 1974-2006) contains records of two main committees: Executive Committee Meeting Minutes, and Faculty Committee Meeting Minutes. The Executive Committee Meeting Minutes cover the years 1978 to 1999. The records include the official meeting minutes and supplementary materials that pertain to the meeting discussions. It also includes lists of committee members from 1976 to 1999, for many different committees. The Faculty Committee Meeting Minutes cover the years 1974-2006 (with some gaps, particularly 2000-2004). The records also include the official meeting minutes and supplementary materials that pertain to the meeting discussions. There is more supplementary material for the later dates. Meetings also included announcements for exhibitions and talks.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series (3 linear feet, ca. 1975-2001) contains the majority of the most recent addition to the record, and is arranged alphabetically. The series is comprised of 35 mm slides, photographic prints and negatives. Images date from 1975 to 2001, and document faculty work, art classes, exhibits, and other school events. There are several folders of interest in this series. The Student Protests folder, which was part of the original accession, has images of an organized protest against proposed budget cuts to the School of Art in the early 1980s. The Francoise Gilot folders contain images of visits by the famed artist, author, and former companion of Pablo Picasso to the School of Art in the 1990s. Also note that many images of faculty or their work are included in the Faculty (miscellaneous) folder, rather than individual folders. The Visual Materials series also contains seven boxes and a binder of slides of faculty work and classroom images. The slides are arranged by category. The categories can be found in the box content listing.</p>
