    <bioghist>
      <p>Arvid Jouppi, internationally-known specialist in the automobile and related industries, was born in Kaleva, Michigan, on March 14, 1918, of Finnish parents. He attended what is now Michigan State University and received his B.A. degree in 1940.uring World War II, Jouppi served as captain in the Marine Corps and became one of the few specialists in electronic countermeasures. He flew 35 combat missions and received the Distinguished Flying Cross. He also continued his education, as a special student at Harvard University and by enrolling in correspondence courses in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>During World War II, Jouppi served as captain in the Marine Corps and became one of the few specialists in electronic countermeasures. He flew 35 combat missions and received the Distinguished Flying Cross. He also continued his education, as a special student at Harvard University and by enrolling in correspondence courses in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>After the war, Jouppi spent several years as news editor in the Detroit Bureau of the Associated Press (AP). The automobile industry was one of the major areas of coverage for the bureau, and it was at that time that Jouppi's interest in automobile-related matters was sparked. In addition, he continued his studies by enrolling as a special student at the University of Michigan graduate school of engineering. He left the AP in 1947 to join the Sperry Gyroscope Company as an engineering supervisor and as editor of the Sperry Engineering Review. He remained at Sperry for five years.</p>
      <p>In 1952, Jouppi began his long association with the automobile industry when he joined General Motors Corporation as a central staff executive. He developed and served as editor of the GM Engineering Journal and later worked in college and university relations. Jouppi left GM to work at Chrysler Corporation in December 1957, serving initially as assistant director of investor relations and later as interim manager of plant and community relations activities. Jouppi then moved from Detroit to New York to become Chrysler's director of public and investor relations activities in the eastern United States. In his position he worked closely with many firms on Wall Street as Chrysler stock became one of the most actively traded on the stock exchange.</p>
      <p>Jouppi's experience in the automobile industry and knowledge of investment practices led him to join Hayden, Stone Incorporated, a major Wall Street brokerage firm, in 1963. He first worked as senior analyst of the automotive, truck, rubber fabricating, automotive parts, and farm machinery fields. One year later he was designated a member of the Research Operations Committee. He was elected vice president in 1966 and assumed management of the firm's retail research activities. In that position, he supervised the budgeting, staffing, programming, and execution of research services for 1100 Hayden, Stone account executives, and an additional 300 executives in correspondent firms. Throughout his tenure at Hayden, Stone, Jouppi arranged forums, or discussion groups, of area financial and industrial leaders, a practice he would continue throughout his career and which would become a trademark of his.</p>
      <p>In 1970, Jouppi was elected to the Board of Directors of Hayden, Stone at a time when the firm was experiencing serious financial difficulties. He worked very hard to save the company, including the investment of a large amount of his own funds, but was unable to do so. In September of that year, Hayden, Stone was taken over by the firm of Cogan, Berlind, Weill and Levitt, and Jouppi's own assets were seriously depleted.</p>
      <p>After the closing of Hayden, Stone, Jouppi immediately went to work for the Detroit research services firm of William C. Roney and Company, as vice president and director of research. He remained for a year but desired to return to Wall Street. In 1971, therefore, he joined the firm of Delafield Childs, Inc., a Wall Street institutional research servicing firm, as vice president, supervisory analyst, and specialist in the automobile industry. He eventually became a senior vice president and member of the executive planning committee. He remained with the firm until January 1975, at which time he left to establish his own research services firm, Arvid Jouppi Associates (AJA), located outside of Detroit, Michigan.</p>
      <p>One of Jouppi's maxims for many years has been that research is critically important to insuring sound financial investments. As head of AJA, his time is devoted, in large part, to automobile-related financial research. He works on a fee basis for companies, fiduciary firms, and governmental agencies, and at times has been affiliated with and worked on a commission basis for various Wall Street firms, including Colin, Hochstin Company, John Muir and Company, and Keane Securities Company, Inc. Because of his extensive experience in studying the automobile industry and his easy accessibility, both the printed and electronic media have turned to him for insight and analysis. He has appeared regularly on the major television and radio networks and is frequently cited in the financial and business sections of leading newspapers.</p>
      <p>Jouppi's personal and professional lives revolve around his devout Christianity. He is a member of the Peace Lutheran Church in Detroit, where he has taught Sunday School for many years, and is a financial advisor and trustee to the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Foundation. He also serves on the board of directors of Suomi College, and has long been affiliated with Gideons International.</p>
      <p>Jouppi was married for many years to the former Marjorie Kline. She died of Parkinson's Disease in 1986. They had four children: Mary (Mrs. Paul Marquis), William, James, and Gloria. In 1987, Jouppi was remarried to Edith Lumley.</p>

      <p>The Arvid Jouppi Papers (24 linear feet) are primarily comprised of materials which document his Wall Street career and his management of Arvid Jouppi Associates. There are only limited materials related to his professional life prior to his tenure at Hayden, Stone. The collection is particularly strong in documenting the everyday work, research findings, and economic philosophy of one of Wall Street's leading automobile industry analysts; the difficulties, at times, of developing and running an independent research services firm (AJA); and the economic vicissitudes of the fields, particularly the automotive field, in which Jouppi was interested and conducted research.</p>
      <p>The Jouppi Papers came to the Bentley Historical Library with only minimal arrangement. The papers had been transferred between Jouppi's offices and home several times and much of the original order of the materials was lost in the process. What remained were materials roughly arranged by chronological stage of Jouppi's professional career. That order has been retained. The papers consist of seven series: Personal; Chronological; Early Career; Hayden, Stone; William C. Roney and Company; Delafield Childs, Inc.; Arvid Jouppi Associates; and Writings. For each series in which there is a correspondence subseries, the correspondence is both incoming and outgoing unless otherwise noted on the contents list, and chronological files of correspondence are arranged by month and year. For each series in which there is a topical subseries, the files are arranged alphabetically.</p>

          <p>The Personal series (1 linear foot) is comprised of two subseries: Topical and Correspondence. It is the series to which the researcher should turn to become familiar with the many stages of Jouppi's professional career, and with the two most important influences on the course of his life, his family and his religious beliefs. Without an appreciation of the latter, the researcher cannot understand what motivated Jouppi in arriving at major decisions.</p>

            <p>The Topical subseries includes Biographical files which contain fairly detailed materials to assist the researcher in determining the major events in Jouppi's life. Materials in the ISSOF Associates and Jouppi Management Company files pertain to the family real estate and mineral rights companies. The Job Searches file contains correspondence and resumes which are valuable in detailing Jouppi's skills and those business areas in which he thought his talents could best be used. The Organizations files document his devotion to both Suomi College and to the Lutheran Church and his involvement, as trustee and president, with the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Foundation. The Prayers and Personal Reflections file includes prayers written by Jouppi which demonstrate his strong reliance on God for guidance in daily affairs.</p>

          <p>The Chronological series (11 linear feet) is comprised of materials generated by Jouppi, which he maintained in separate files arranged chronologically by year and month. Included are correspondence (mostly outgoing) and reports, primarily related to Jouppi's professional career, and miscellaneous materials which are of a personal nature. The files are nearly complete for the years 1966-1987. They provide valuable details regarding Jouppi's research activities and offer great insight into his personality. Because of their completeness, they should be studied prior to reviewing those series which pertain to individual phases of Jouppi's professional career.</p>

          <p>The Early Career series (2 folders) contains materials related to Jouppi's employment with Sperry Gyroscope Company and Chrysler Corporation. They are mostly correspondence and clippings, but there are interesting notes and memoranda prepared by Jouppi regarding the conduct of his Chrysler investor relations work.</p>

          <p>The Hayden, Stone series (2.5 linear feet) pertains to Jouppi's employment with the firm, which lasted from 1963-1970. For the first three years he was with the firm, he was responsible for monitoring activity in the automobile industry for the research department. Much of the materials from those years are comprised of the reports which he generated. The materials from the later years of this subseries document Jouppi's administrative duties (he was made second vice president of research in 1966 and was appointed head of the research department in April of 1969), as well as his continuing research activities.</p>
          <p>The series is divided into three subseries: Administrative, Topical, and Correspondence. The strength of both the Administrative and Topical subseries lies in the materials from which the researcher can study the activities of the research department of a major Wall Street brokerage firm, and through Jouppi, gain insight into possible reasons for its takeover by another firm. Particularly valuable are the Interoffice Communications files and Research Department file in the Administrative subseries and the Reports files in the Topical subseries. In addition, the researcher can study major trends in the automobile and related industries and determine how Wall Street viewed and reacted to them.</p>

            <p>The Correspondence subseries covers a variety of topics related to Hayden, Stone affairs and should be used to supplement the other two subseries. It is divided into two categories, Chronological and Personal. Jouppi kept a separate folder of correspondence labeled Personal, but which appears to be business related and is arranged chronologically by year and month. Interoffice memoranda are included in this folder.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The William C. Roney and Company series (.5 linear feet) covers the period September 1970, to late November 1971, when Jouppi was employed as vice president and director of research. The quantity of materials reflects the limited tenure of his stay. The papers are divided into three subseries: Administrative, Topical, and Correspondence. Jouppi's administrative planning and organizing activities at Roney can be traced from the Administrative subseries and from Report files in the Topical subseries. The researcher will find Jouppi's outlines of plans for organizing his sector of the company and for broadening his client base, as well as his proposals for structuring the entire Roney organization. Those interested in the automobile industry will find 1971 industry analyses prepared by Jouppi. The Correspondence subseries concerns various business-related matters.</p>

          <p>The Delafield Childs, Inc., series (2.5 linear feet) covers the years 1971-1975 when Jouppi worked for the New York firm as vice president and supervisory analyst. It is organized into three subseries: Administration, Topical, and Correspondence. The Administrative files are particularly valuable for the researcher interested in Jouppi's client relationships. The course of his contact with clients can be traced from the Client Contact Sheets, which are alphabetically arranged and document the years 1973-74. They provide information on the type of contact Jouppi made - telephone calls, mailings, or visits - and brief synopses of topics of discussion. The Institutional Client Contact Sheets describe, for each client during a given period of time, all of the contacts made by Delafield Childs analysts and the subjects under discussion.</p>

            <p>The results of the research which Jouppi conducted at Delafield, Childs can be found in the Topical subseries. There are a number of Company files, which were maintained by Jouppi on both client firms and those firms which he studied. The materials are of varying quality and range from correspondence, field visit notes, and conversation notes, to statistical operating records. In addition, Newsletters, under the titles "Cars," "Farm Machinery," and "Rubber," are arranged chronologically by year and month, and include analyses of past trends and projections of future economic directions. The researcher might encounter duplication of materials in the Company and Newsletter files.</p>

          <p>As Jouppi prepared to leave Delafield Childs he was already making plans to set up a research services firm, of which he would be president. Creating Arvid Jouppi Associates, or AJA as it is commonly known, was designed to emphasize Jouppi's belief that strong research is one of the most important components of sound business investing. The records of the Arvid Jouppi Associates series (5.5 linear feet) are divided into five subseries: Administrative, Topical, Michigan Research Center, "One of A Kind," and Correspondence. Throughout the AJA series, the researcher will find materials such as prayers, essays on the use of Christian principles in operating AJA, reflections on Jouppi's relationship with God, and other Christian narratives (in letter or report form), which document the influence of Jouppi's religious beliefs on all aspects of his life. These materials are important because they reflect what is on Jouppi's mind at various times regarding his business and personal lives. As a devout Christian, Jouppi was an evangelist among his associates, friends, and acquaintances. Although his correspondence with these people is, at times, intensely personal, it often includes informative histories of Jouppi's relationship to them.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Administrative subseries contains records which relate to the development, administration, and maintenance of AJA, including the difficulties of running a one-man research firm. It can be used to study the ideas behind Jouppi's establishment of AJA; the business activities in which he participated on a daily basis, including field trips and public meetings of business leaders (see also Topical subseries, Forums files); and the difficulties he had in finding clients and competing with large investment research services companies.(see also Topical subseries, Reports, "Personal Story")</p>

            <p>Those materials which relate to Jouppi's research regarding the automobile and related industries can be found in the Topical subseries, Reports, Studies, and Company files. This documentation is thorough; all reports generated by the firm for the years 1974-1985 are found here. The Reports files include both narratives and statistical compilations. From them the researcher can study both Jouppi's methodological approach as well as his findings on industry patterns. The Studies files consists of materials from specific company studies or studies of specific aspects of the automobile industry. As with other series in this collection, the researcher will find individual Company files which also can be used to study Jouppi's research methods and the findings from his efforts.</p>
            <p>There are other materials of interest in the Topical subseries. They include records and transcripts from several Congressional hearings in which Jouppi testified; materials concerning actual and proposed business ventures, including one related to investment research; and Jouppi reflections and studies on the automobile industry in Japan.</p>

            <p>The Michigan Research Center was run by Jouppi in conjunction with several Wall Street firms with which he was affiliated. The Michigan Research Center subseries is arranged topically, and is primarily comprised of Reports generated by Jouppi on the automobile industries. The reports take the form of outlooks, projections, statistical data on growth, earnings, sales and expenditures, as well as announcements and agendas for conferences, Jouppi's reflections on business, and information pertinent to major companies. The researcher may find duplication of materials generated by the Michigan Research Center in the Topical and "One of a Kind" subseries.</p>

            <p>The "One of a Kind" subseries (1978-1986), designated as such by Jouppi, is a collection of business materials which he maintained separately in chronological order by year and month. These documents, which include correspondence, reports, and conference notes and agendas, are a valuable representation of Jouppi's business interests for the year. The researcher will find overlap between this subseries and the Chronological series.</p>

          <p>In the Writings series (.5 linear feet), the final series in the collection, the most important item is a 373 page manuscript by Jouppi entitled "Automotive Heads and Tales." In Jouppi's own words, it is intended to be "a combination of automobilia, stories of related Wall Street research activity and reports on associated involvements by the governments of the United States, Canada, and Japan and several other nations." It is a broad, historical look at the automotive industry, and offers insight into Jouppi's relationships with leaders in the industry.</p>
