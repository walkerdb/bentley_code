      <p>Work on aging at the University of Michigan began under the auspices of the Institute for Human Adjustment. The nation's first adult education program for older people was begun in 1948 by Clark Tibbitts, then director of the institute. In 1951 the Board of Regents of the University created the Division of Gerontology as part of the Institute for Human Adjustment. Wilma Donahue, of the Psychological Clinic, was appointed the division's first chairperson. In 1965 the Michigan State Legislature passed House Bill No. 2748 to create the Institute of Gerontology (IoG), jointly sponsored by the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Wilma Donahue and Lawrence Power were named co-directors.</p>
      <p>In the enabling act, IoG's objectives were defined as: "developing new and improved programs for helping older people in [Michigan], for the training of persons skilled in working with the problems of the aged, for research related to the needs...of our aging population, and for conducting community service programs in the field of aging." To accomplish these objectives, the institute has worked closely with other units of the universities. The IoG offers short courses for in-service training, a curricula at the master's level, and seeks to attract doctoral students in several disciplines to specialize in gerontological problems.</p>
      <p>At the outset, Wayne State and the University of Michigan took responsibility for different aspects of the institute's unitary plan. Wayne State emphasized medical and health related fields, while the University of Michigan concentrated on economic, social, employment/retirement, and educational areas. The University of Michigan's program is highlighted by several projects, among them the investigation of "milieu" therapy in the rehabilitation of geriatric mental hospital patients, the development of discussion programs for use in training community leaders to serve older persons, and stimulating the inclusion of gerontological content in the basic science and professional school curricula.</p>
      <p>While the Institute of Gerontology has made many contributions to the nation's attitudes toward and programs for the elderly, its most visible program has been the series of annual conferences on aging which began in 1948 and ended in 1975. The conferences drew national audiences of 600 to 1300 persons who participated in workshops and listened to leading gerontologists present their most recent research findings. Many of the papers presented were published in the IoG's Occasional Papers series.</p>
      <p>The IoG underwent considerable change in the early 1980s, beginning with the appointment of Richard Adelman as the UM co-director. Adelman shifted the IoG's focus from pedagogy and generally public-oriented programming to research. Conference activity was curtailed sharply and the continuing education program in geriatric education was rapidly phased out. The institute began to direct its attentions increasingly to multi-disciplinary research and formed alliances with a broad cross-section of UM departments, from architecture and music to medicine and biology. This approach proved difficult for some staff members, but ultimately resulted in the IoG being much more focused on research, preserving the institute's place on the leading edge of geriatric research.</p>
      <p>The Institute of Gerontology is governed by a ten-member Executive Board. The board's members are appointed by the presidents of the two universities; in turn the board appoints the institute's co-directors. The size and composition of the institute has varied over time, depending as much on "soft" funds from individual grants as on the "hard" money provided by the parent universities. The two principle funding agencies have been the U.S. Administration on Aging and the Michigan Commission on Aging.</p>

      <p>The records of the Institute of Gerontology cover the period 1948 to 1987. They are composed of the office files of several staff members at the University of Michigan. (Not included are the records of that part of the IoG housed at Wayne State University.) Included are the scattered files of four of the institute's co-directors, the chairman of the Executive Board, the editor of the Occasional Papers series, the annual conference coordinators, and the directors of certain projects. Also included are correspondence and memos, financial information, grant proposals and reports, minutes, and printed matter. The programs for the Annual Conferences on Aging provide a "who's who" for many of the individuals represented in the collection.</p>
      <p>The records provide an overview of the activities, policies, and personnel of the IoG from its inception. Some substantive and seminal memos and reports exist which throw light on the development of programs and on the value of certain projects. Most of the documents are routine, however, and serve primarily to introduce the researcher to the various units and activities of the institute. For details and insights into particular aspects of the IoG, the researcher should consult the separate collections of the various co-directors, directors of research, and project directors, as well as the institute's publications.</p>

          <p>The General Documents series includes a variety historical and administrative files documenting the founding, administration and programs of the Institute of gerontology. Among the most important folders in the series is that containing Program Descriptions and Progress Reports. Here are several early statements of purpose for the IoG, definitions of the division of labor between the two universities, descriptions of the duties of the executive board, and early accounts of activities. (Other progress reports will be found in the Budget Requests and Supporting Documents series.) This folder, along with those of the Ad Hoc Committee and the earliest correspondence, give a good documentation of the origins of the institute. The Promotional and Informational Material folders--course and program descriptions, mostly--give an overview of some of the training programs, both short and long-term, of the IoG.</p>

          <p>The Ad Hoc University Committee on Gerontology, 1965, was the committee responsible for implementing Governor Romney's intention to create an Institute of Gerontology. Its major task was to decide whether the proposed institute should offer a degree-granting program at the master's level, a point about which there was some considerable disagreement. The report, some of the minutes, and some of the correspondence pertain to this debate.</p>

          <p>By far the most informative documents in the Budget Requests and Supporting Documents, 1965-1985, series are the supporting documents--yearly "Statements of Program." These generally summarize the current status of the training, service, and research programs, as well as provide projections into the next fiscal year to justify the requested budget. Other documents include memos and correspondence--mostly routine, but occasionally discussing the justification for various components of the budget. Additional correspondence relating to budgetary and fiscal matters is found in the Correspondence series.</p>

          <p>The arrangement of the Correspondence and Memos, 1949-1983 series reflects the original order of the material. The series includes carbons and photocopies of correspondence sent, as well as correspondence received. There is some duplication between the files of persons in communication with one another.</p>
          <p>Much of the correspondence is routine, relating to the fine tuning of the budget, contacts from colleagues and friends, and personnel problems. But there is policy discussion represented as well, such as memos outlining the 1965 staff comments on the goals of the short-term training program and suggestions in 1972 for reshaping or scrapping the annual conferences. Overall, this series provides a good glimpse into both the bureaucratic and substantive concerns of the institute, as seen through the eyes of its executives.</p>

          <p>The 1948 Annual Conference on Aging was the only meeting of its kind in the nation. Originally the conferences were primarily a means of bringing together and publishing noteworthy papers in the field of gerontology. Over time they became somewhat less academic and more "action-practitioner" oriented, with more emphasis placed on workshops and discussions. The papers and proceedings from several of the conferences were published, and may be consulted at the IoG Library (Learning Resource Center). A list of such publications will be found here in the Learning Resource Center folders of the Miscellaneous series. The Annual Conference on Aging, 1948-1975, series contains the printed programs from every conference, scattered pamphlets and rosters. More important are the Correspondence, Financial Information, Notes, Summaries, and Miscellaneous folders for scattered years. Most of these folders are from Woodrow Hunter's files. (Hunter was, at different times, conference coordinator and co-director of the institute.) Noteworthy material in the folders includes a primer for workgroup leaders (1954); descriptions of duties of workshop moderators and resource people, a survey of participants, and post-conference critiques (1973). The Conference Addresses and Unpublished Papers folders contain some transcripts of a panel discussion (1970). (See also the Sound Tapes series in this collection).</p>

          <p>The Other Conferences and Symposia, 1950-1980 series documents conferences sponsored by IoG as well as some which IoG staff participated in. The most important portions of this series are those conferences sponsored by the IoG. The Aging and the Art of Living conference spawned an exhibit of Images of Old Age in America, sponsored by the Smithsonian Institute, which toured the country from 1977 through 1986. The Issues in Aging Training Workshop brought state government officials from across the nation together to exchange ideas and information and to receive guidance from the academic community.</p>

          <p>The Programs, Projects, Studies, and Curricula, 1964-1981, series provides some of the best documentation of the variety of the IoG's programmatic work. The best documented of those programs also seem to be among the most important. The Biology of Aging program--of which the 1975 conference was but an early stage--documents the lengthy development of a proposal to initiate an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in research on the physiology of the aging process. Material on the Educational Gerontology Graduate program includes proposals, memos, and correspondence relating to the origins of the nation's first curricula to bestow advanced degrees for teaching the elderly. The program was developed under the aegis of the School of Education, with interdisciplinary support.</p>
          <p>The Health Advocacy for Older People project served Oakland, Livingston, Washtenaw, and Jackson counties, though the material in this collection is from Jackson County only. The project sought to improve access to and the quality of health care for low-income older people by training peer advocates and holding informational workshops. The Milieu Therapy Training program was a long-term research and demonstration project to improve the environment and hence the treatment of elderly mental patients.</p>
          <p>One of the most important curricula in the IoG was the Specialists in Aging Training program. This program had two facets: a long-term master's degree curricula and a short-term residential institute leading to a certificate of specialization. Additional information regarding the Residential Institute will be found in the separate collection of Woodrow Hunter's papers. A less significant, but still noteworthy, project was the Senior Sounds radio program on WUOM, the transcripts for which are contained in this series (tapes of these shows may be found in the library's collection of WUOM, Tapes, B Series). Three other radio programs produced by IoG are represented in the Sound Tapes series in this collection.</p>

          <p>The Unfunded Programs, Projects, Studies, and Curricula, 1964-1977 series documents proposals which, for one reason or another, never got off the ground. They remain important because they reflect additional concerns of the institute staff. Indeed, the fact that these projects did not receive funding is not necessarily an accurate reflection of their worth. In any case, failures may be as informative as successes in studying the history of an institute and of a profession.</p>

          <p>The bulk of the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Hospital, 1976-1981 material concerns the Hospital's Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC). Harold Johnson, co-director of the IoG, was one of several individuals from outside the hospital to be consulted on the development of the GRECC proposal. The hospital hoped to involve the university community as a whole in the center; the object was to provide holistic care and to integrate research and treatment.</p>

          <p>Miscellaneous Files, 1956-1981 includes material on a variety of institute and staff activities. Most noteworthy are the folders for the institute's Learning Resource Center (Library). Included in those folders are lists of IoG publications and lists of the Annual Conferences on Aging for which published proceedings and/or papers exist. Also worth remarking in the series are a few short addresses and articles by Wilma Donahue, scattered documents concerning the origins of both the Michigan Society of Gerontology and the Michigan Commission on Aging, some statistics on the elderly of Washtenaw County, and some correspondence with two visiting scholars from Eastern Europe. Additional scattered correspondence with visiting scholars may be found in the portion of the Other Conferences and Symposia series relating to Wilma Donahue.</p>

          <p>The Sound Recording Series, primarily audio cassettes, is comprised of four subseries: 25th Annual Conference; three radio programs produced IoG; "The Aging of Europe," "New Goals for Aging" and a lecture series "Learning for Longer Living"; Miscellaneous tapes; and a collection IoG speeches, training tapes and conference proceedings. The originals of the radio programs were identified by a numerical designation preceded by "GE", although some of the tapes here are cassette copies. Few of the tapes are dated but the "GE" sequence seems to span the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s.</p>

            <p>The 25th Annual Conference subseries consists of recordings of the papers presented and forum discussions at the 25th Annual Conference in 1972. Most of the papers were published by IoG and may be consulted at the institute's library. The tapes here are the edited versions of the original presentations, and most are on audio cassettes. The next three subseries are radio programs produced by IoG. The originals were identified by a numerical designation preceded by "GE", although some of the tapes here are cassette copies. Few of the tapes are dated but the "GE" sequence seems to span the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s.</p>

          <p>The Institute Files series is comprised of documents which are essentially internal in nature. Among the most valuable files are those in the Annual Reports folders, which offer very detailed information on the activities of staff members for the academic years 1982/83-1984/5 and 1987/88. Also of interest are the files in the Professional Studies in Aging subseries. These cover the end of the certificate program in gerontology that the IoG had offered up to 1983. They include correspondence from students and faculty concerning the change in the IoG's focus. The shift in the institute's philosophy reflected by this change was difficult for many staff members, but ultimately created an institute better able to enter the nationwide debate on geriatric issues.</p>

          <p>The University Files series is more administrative in nature, and is broken into two subseries based on the relationship between IoG and the respective UM unit. The first subseries, Academic Units, details the IoG's focus on interdisciplinary research. The IoG made alliances with a surprising variety of UM units (for example, with the School of Music, the School of Architecture and the Department of Biology) to further research and understanding of the aging process in a holistic manner. The second subseries, Administrative Units, is less illuminating; although it does illustrate some of the IoG's dealings with the university administration, it does so in a cursory and inconsistent way. The most interesting files show the close relationship between the IoG Chairman, Richard Adelman, and the man he succeeded, Harold Johnson, who left IoG to become Vice President for Academic Affairs.</p>
