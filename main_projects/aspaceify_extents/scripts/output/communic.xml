      <p>The Department of Communication came into existence on July 1, 1979 as a result of a merger between the Department of Journalism and the speech component of the Department of Speech Communication and Theatre. This merger represented the culmination of almost a decade of discussion.</p>
      <p>In the early 1970s some members of both predecessor departments noted significant overlaps within the two unit's missions, prompting discussions regarding the possibility of a departmental merger. These discussions received considerable impetus in 1974 when the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LS&amp;A) Performance Evaluation Committee took official notice of the two departments' similarities and recommended the possibility of a merger be seriously explored. In 1975 the LS&amp;A College Priorities Committee noted the Performance Evaluation Committee's suggestions, and reaffirmed the importance of serious merger discussions. The Department of Journalism moved quickly to implement the committee's recommendations, and by the Spring of 1977 had put forward a formal merger proposal. The Department of Speech Communication and Theatre was, however, unconvinced that a sufficient rationale existed to justify a merger and, while open to discussion, put forward no merger plan of its own. Finally, in early 1978, as LS&amp;A dean Billy Frye announced his plans to establish a special faculty committee to examine the situation, the Department of Speech Communication and Theater offered for discussion its own merger plan.</p>
      <p>A major concern of the Speech Communication and Theater departmental leadership was the possible dismemberment of the department in any merger. The department as constituted had three major components: speech and hearing sciences, theatre, and speech communication. Sentiment for an independent theater department was strong. As early as 1974 individuals involved in theatre work had suggested the formation of an independent department. LS&amp;A's College Priorities Committee, while acknowledging that the speech and hearing sciences component of the department was first rate, had concluded that it was an area of study that did not really belong among the humanities. The clear implication was that in any major departmental restructuring this element of the program would likely be spun off into a new "scientific" home. Journalism's primary interest was in merging only with the speech communication component of the department. Thus Speech Communication and Theater, as an existing entity, could foresee little gain but much loss in any department merger.</p>
      <p>In October 1978 the special committee appointed by Dean Frye submitted a terse report in which it generally recommended the division of the existing speech department along the lines feared by Speech. The committee concluded that sentiment for a separate theatre department had grown so strong that its establishment seemed certain. The committee recommended that the remaining two components of the department be located in other departments through a process of mutual negotiation, with the speech communication element to be merged with an expanded and renamed Journalism Department. In January 1979 Dean Frye informed the faculties of the Speech Communication and Theater Department and the journalism department of his intention to recommend to the Regents formal action along the lines outlined by the special committee. In March 1979 the Regents heard and accepted the dean's report, authorizing the establishment of two new departments within LS&amp;A, the Department of Communication and the Department of Theater and Drama.</p>
      <p>While the Regent's action formally resolved the structural issues, there was still at issue a question of the centrality of the new Department of Communication to the basic mission of LS&amp;A. While the excellence of the program offered through the department was generally acknowledged, the LS&amp;A College Priorities Committee, in 1975, had stated that, "[The CPC] does not regard Journalism as of central importance in a liberal arts education." The fundamental question facing the new department, then, was not a matter of demonstrating its excellence, but rather in demonstrating its importance to the humanities. The arena for the continuing discussion of this issue was the budgetary reduction process of the early 1980s. Communication had lost several tenure track positions as a result of the merger, and in the next few years three more tenure track positions were lost as a result of budgetary considerations. While the department survived, it did so in a somewhat reduced form.</p>
      <p>In 1995, a review committee evaluated the future of the graduate-level journalism degree program and recommended that a Certificate in Journalism be explored. The committee also recommended that the Masters in Journalism degree program within LS&amp;A not be relocated and that a moratorium be placed on admissions to the program in the Fall of 1996. The recommendations followed an earlier faculty committee which advised that the Department of Communication be restructured for undergraduate and doctoral study of mass communication. The resulting Department of Communication Studies was intended to focus on the study of the process of mass communication, rather than the preparation of journalists.</p>

      <p>The Department of Communication record group consists of ten linear feet of records dating from 1926 to 1995 and processed in four accessions. The pre-1984 accessions document the Department of Journalism. The 1984 accession includes materials accumulated by professor Marion Marzolf. The 1986 accession represents records created through the merger of Journalism with Speech and the records of the new department's chairman after the merger was accomplished. The 1996 accession contains material similar to the earlier accessions with the exception of material relating to the graduate Master in Journalism degree program and the decision to suspend the program.</p>
      <p>The original accession (Boxes 1-5) documents Department of Journalism activity from 1928 to 1981 (primarily 1950-1970). The accession has been divided into three series: Administrative Files; Faculty Personnel Records; and Internships, Fellowships and Scholarships.</p>
      <p>The 1984 accession consists of three series of records: those from a 1977 conference, "Kerner Plus 10: Minorities and the Media," those from the University of Michigan student chapter of Kappa Tau Alpha, and those from the student chapter of Women in Communications, Inc. (WICI). Both the Kerner conference records and the WICI records reflect the involvement of Professor Marion T. Marzolf in the Department of Communication.</p>
      <p>The 1986 accession dates from 1964 to 1986 (primarily 1975-1984). It represents the records kept by Peter Clarke, last chairman of the Department of Journalism and first chairman of the Department of Communication, the files of William E. Porter, who served as chair after Clarke's resignation in 1981, and a few documents of John D. Stevens, who succeeded Porter in 1984. The accession has been divided into two series, Chairman's Correspondence (1964-1985) and a Topical File (1949-1986).</p>

            <p>Departmental Research project material includes correspondence, surveys and reports dated between 1950 and 1959. Of particular interest was the Evart project (1956) in which students managed a small Michigan newspaper. A history of Whitehall, Michigan is also included in this unit. The third unit, general, contains miscellaneous information about the research program, a few student papers, and letters to newspaper editors throughout Michigan written by the Department of Journalism seeking new research ideas.</p>

          <p>Internships, Fellowships, and Scholarships has two subseries; administrative files and student files. The administrative file includes correspondence, program descriptions, lists, and other papers concerning the program in general. Most of these materials relate to the University Press Club Fellowships (foreign student internships) and Post BA and MA Journalism training fellowships (American students). The student files have been arranged alphabetically under the two major internships programs mentioned above. The student reports are most interesting as they contain the students' comments about Michigan newspapers and the communities where they interned. There is one file of special note on Tom Hayden, a founder and leader of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).</p>
          <p>A large number of additional student papers prepared by Journalism students have been cataloged separately under the heading: University of Michigan. Department of Journalism. A finding aid exists describing these records.</p>

          <p>"Kerner Plus 10," held on April 22, 1977, was sponsored by the Department of Journalism's Howard R. Marsh Center for the Study of Journalistic Performance. Professor Marzolf was one of the planners and directors of the conference, which examined the question of minority representation in the media ten years after the Kerner Commission. The original Kerner Commission was established following the Detroit riots of 1967, and delivered an indictment directed at racism in the American news media. This series includes a published conference report as well as a transcript of the proceedings. Of special interest are the questionnaire responses from Black and Chicano news professionals concerning the situation in individual work places.</p>

          <p>The records of Women in Communications, Inc. (WICI) also reflect the involvement of Marion Marzolf. The local records date from 1970 to 1981, the period for which Marzolf was faculty advisor to the group. WICI is a national professional organization for people working in the various branches of the media and for journalism and communications students. The organization was founded as Theta Sigma Phi at the University of Washington in 1909. In 1926, the Alpha Theta Chapter was established at the University of Michigan. In 1972, the name was changed to Women in Communications, Inc., and men were formally admitted as organization members. The records in this series include files kept on the Michigan chapter by the national office (1935-1974), which were returned to Michigan after being microfilmed, and local files kept between 1970-1981. The local files include newsletters, minutes, agendas and flyers as well as correspondence between Marzolf and ex-students discussing the difficulties faced by women entering the field of journalism. The file on the 50th anniversary of WICI in 1976 contains particularly interesting descriptions by early women journalists of their experiences in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.</p>

            <p>The Chairman's Correspondence is generally arranged by year or group of years and thereunder alphabetically. Of special note is a 1975 file regarding University of Michigan graduate and <title render="italic">Esquire</title> editor Arnold Gingrich (Gingrich's personal papers and the records of <title render="italic">Esquire</title> magazine are held by the Bentley Library). In an effort to obtain an honorary degree for Gingrich, several leading literary figures were solicited for their support. Replies were received from individuals such as John Hersey and Norman Mailer.</p>

            <p>The Topical File is arranged alphabetically. It is particularly interesting for information about the journalism department's role in the 1979 merger and also for its discussion of the operation of the newly formed Department of Communication. The merger is discussed in some detail through a chronology drawn up by Helen Uete, and supported through quotation from original documents drawn from the journalism department's files and now grouped together as supporting documentation for the chronology. The operation of the new department is detailed through faculty meeting minutes (1980-1986), memos to the faculty from the chairman (1979-1984), and through a strong body of records regarding curriculum decisions (1982-1986).</p>

          <p>Records from the John L. Brumm Scholarship Fund comprise the largest portion of the accession, adding important documents about the establishment of the award and its applicants. These documents provide important demographic information about the students applying for and receiving the scholarship and deserve to be examined. The scholarship was named in honor of John L. Brumm who served as the first chairman of the Department of Journalism following its official founding in 1929 (Journalism's roots extend much earlier, dating back to courses offered by Fred Newton Scott before 1900). Also included are photographs of several Brumm scholarship winners.</p>
          <p>Records of the journalism department's Summer Workshops provide information about the organization and sponsors of this long-running educational program for high school students and educators, begun in the 1950s. This material is particularly valuable for its glimpse into journalism training in Michigan's high schools. Also interesting are the records of Michigan newspapers that sponsored students for the workshops.</p>

        <head>Index to Student Internship Files, by Newspaper</head>
        <p>Note: As part of their studies in the department of communication, students had the opportunity to work on various Michigan newspapers. Their reports and other papers to the department of communication often include information of interests to researchers of specific newspapers. The materials will be found in the students' internship file (foreign or American). The following is an index by name of newspaper to these files:</p>
