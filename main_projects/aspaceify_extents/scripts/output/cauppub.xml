      <p>The A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture + Urban Planning Publications (11 linear feet) are divided into four series: Unit Publications; Sub-Unit Publications; Topical Publications; and Student Publications. The bulk of the publications document the College of Architecture and Urban Planning, its organization, course offerings, communications to faculty, staff, students, and alumni, and various research reports written by the college's faculty. Further research is documented in the publications of the Architectural Research Laboratory (ARL), and the Architecture and Planning Research Laboratory (APRL). Some publications (or their successors) may no longer be available in print but are available on the school s website.</p>
      <p>The 2012 accession contains digital publications donated and published by the Communications Department of the College of Architecture and Urban Planning from 2010 to 2012. Although these materials were created by a single office within the college, they correspond to three existing series within the record group: UNIT PUBLICATIONS, TOPICAL PUBLICATIONS, and STUDENT PUBLICATIONS.</p>
      <p>The UNIT PUBLICATIONS series contains printed material published specifically by the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. These publications are defined as being widely distributed and may be published at regular intervals. They are arranged by genre of the publication.</p>
      <p>The Unit Publications series (5.5 linear feet) includes articles, bibliographies, brochures, bulletins including college catalogs, directories, histories, holiday cards, lectures, manuals, newsletters, policies and procedures, posters, programs, proposals, prospectuses, and reports. The articles from <title render="italic">Michigan Alumnus</title> and <title render="italic">Research News</title> document the College of Architecture and Urban Planning from 1961 to 1988. Bulletins (college catalogs) are arranged chronologically and date as early as 1876. The print version of the bulletin is the authoritative source of admission information, course offerings and degree requirements. The college bulletins comprise almost two linear feet of the Unit Publications.</p>
      <p>Directories such as the <title render="italic">Faculty-Staff Directory</title> and the <title render="italic">Faculty Directory</title> do not contain photographs, but do describe the faculty members' education, teaching expertise, academic and professional honors, professional experience, sponsored research, service to the community, memberships, and a select list of publications. The Bentley Historical Library holdings date from 1960 to 1999. The history <title render="italic">More Than a Handsome Box: Education in Architecture at the University of Michigan, 1876-1986</title> is found in this series. The College of Architecture and Urban Planning published an internal newsletter, <title render="italic">CAUP Newsletter</title>, from 1987 through 1988. It was replaced in 1988 by the <title render="italic">Newsletter</title>. In 1999, the <title render="italic">Newsletter</title> was discontinued and <title render="italic">CAUPnews</title>, an e-mail publication represented by printouts in this record group, took its place. It was renamed <title render="italic">TCAUP News</title> in 2002 to reflect the name change which took place in 1999. First issued in 1984 and continuing to the present, <title render="italic">Portico</title>, the College's outreach publication, discusses the activities of the faculty, students, and the College's alumni and friends. This series also includes proposals and reports describing various study programs such as the <title render="italic">Architecture Program Report</title> dated 1986 to 1988 and the <title render="italic">Organization of a Department of Urban Planning</title> published in 1966. There are also reports describing Unistrut space frame systems and structural systems integrating mechanical systems.</p>
      <p>The SUB-UNIT PUBLICATIONS series contains publications from subordinate offices, departments, programs and organizations within the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. These publications are arranged alphabetically by the creating sub-unit. The Sub-Unit Publications series (3.7 linear feet) includes publications from the Architectural Research Laboratory (ARL) and the Architecture and Planning Research Laboratory.</p>
      <p>The Architectural Research Laboratory (ARL) was founded, in 1949, by Theodore Larson, his colleagues, and students, creating the first architectural research program in the United States. The ARL publications include brochures and volumes from the ARL/UM monograph series. There are also proceedings from the Minorities in Planning and Related Professions conference as well as reports published in 1970. Also included in this series are reports on the design of Michigan and American courthouses published in the 1970s through the 1990s. Reports on child facilities will be found in the ARL subseries under Early Childhood Facilities (ECF). There are also publications from Environmental Design and Research (EDR), Man Environment Reference (MER) and School Environment Research Project (SER).</p>
      <p>In 1974, the educational structure of the college was reorganized to create the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. To reflect this change the research mission was broadened to include the new urban planning element. The Architectural Research Laboratory became the Architecture and Planning Research Laboratory (APRL). The APRL publications include brochures, manuals, and the newsletter <title render="italic">Research News</title>. The Bentley Library holds issues of this newsletter dating from 1984 to 1995. The bulk of publications from the APRL are reports describing energy management, manufactured housing and simulation techniques for planning and design. There are also publications from specific projects such as Design America, Factories of the Future and the Role of Design in American Corporations.</p>
      <p>There are also publications from the Doctoral Program in Architecture, North Campus Studio and Program in Architecture (1972-1991). The Urban and Regional Planning Program (1964-2000) includes brochures, bulletins, manuals, newsletters, and proposals. This series also contains the published Raoul Wallenberg Lectures and the John Dinkeloo Lectures. They will be found in the Sub-Unit Publications series under the surnames Dinkeloo and Wallenberg.</p>
      <p>The Topical Publications series includes printed materials published to document specific events or activities such as fund-raising or one-time conferences hosted by the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. The Topical Publications series contains publications about Alumni such as the <title render="italic">Alumni Directory</title> printed in 1956 and 1989, as well as information about the annual Alumni Reunion Weekend in 1990 and 1991. There is also extensive information on the Art and Architecture Building including floor plans, proposals, and reports. Researchers will also find portfolios of student work from the Design Studios of 1981 and 1994, along with abstracts of student theses from the "Thesis Final Reviews" of 2005 and 2006. There are also publications documenting the Semicentennial celebrated in 1956, and the Centennial celebrated in 2006.</p>
      <p>The Student Publications series contains publications published by student groups within the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. The Student Publications series includes a complete run of the journal <title render="italic">Dimensions</title> from 1987 to the present. There are several student newsletters, including the <title render="italic">Architectural Synthesis</title> published from 1968 to 1969, <title render="italic">The Allnighter</title>, printed from 1973 to 1979, and <title render="italic">Synergy</title> issued from 1980 to 1983. In addition there are several other short-lived publications produced by the students.</p>
      <p>Each year since 1980, the Graduation Committee produced a graduation yearbook containing a section for each graduating student. These individual student-designed sections frequently include a photograph and the current address of the graduating student. In some cases, however, they include designs, witticisms, invitations and notes to friends, and discussions of jobs and future plans. They are an excellent source for information not only on the graduates, but also student life in the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. The Bentley Historical Library holds these yearbooks from 1980 to 1997, and 2000.</p>
      <p>Digital Accessions received in 20012</p>
      <p>Materials in the Unit Publications series include brochures, newsletters, invitations, posters, and programs produced from 2010 to 2012. The brochures provide information on college admissions (as well as degree requirements, career services, student life, and facilities), fellowships and Master of Science Programs (including Conservation, Material Systems, and Digital Technologies). The college newsletter <title render="italic">Portico</title>, contains updates and news from the college administration and faculty as well as information on student academic honors and events. Invitations document "College on the Road" events in Chicago and receptions at the annual meetings for the American Institute of Architects and American Planning Association. Posters highlight conferences, student and faculty exhibits, and guest lectures hosted by the college, which include appearances by featured architects such as, Jeff Kipnis, Peter Eisenmen, Elizabeth Diller, and Alejandro Zaera. The programs document a luncheon honoring Taubman Scholars as well as information on modernist architects in Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>Programs for alumni reunion weekend events in 2010 and 2011 were added to the Topical Publications series.</p>
      <p>Digital files added to the Student Publications series include programs for the college's annual commencement activities for 2011 and 2012, with lists of student speakers, university representatives, faculty readers, and graduates by program specialization.</p>
