    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>William Lucas, whose career in public service has spanned 35 years, was born in Harlem, in 1928. When he was orphaned in his early teens (his West Indian immigrant parents died within a year of each other), he went to live with and was raised by an aunt. He attended Morris High School in the Bronx, and starred on the school track team. Because of his track skill he was offered a number of collegiate athletic scholarships, and accepted one from Manhattan College. He was the first in his family to go to college, and graduated with honors, in 1952, with a Bachelor of Science degree.</p>
      <p>After graduation, Lucas spent several years as a teacher and welfare case worker in New York City. In 1953 he joined the New York Police Department, where he remained for nine years, often working undercover in Harlem. From his experiences with the city legal system he decided to become a lawyer, and attended Fordham University at night. He received his law degree in 1962, and at the graduation ceremony he met Robert Kennedy, who offered him a job in the Justice Department. Lucas accepted and spent two years as an investigator in the civil rights division. He then joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a special agent, stationed first in Cincinnati, and later in Detroit. He left the Bureau in 1967 to become Wayne County undersheriff, and two years later was appointed Wayne County sheriff when Roman Gribbs vacated the position after winning election as mayor of Detroit. Lucas was elected Wayne County sheriff in his own right in 1970 and reelected twice thereafter, serving in that capacity for thirteen years. In 1982, he ran successfully for the newly-created office of Wayne County Executive. He served for four years as the chief officer of the third largest county in the United States.</p>
      <p>Explaining that he was dismayed by the influence of special interests in the Democratic party, Lucas switched political affiliation to the Republican party in May 1985. He won the Republican gubernatorial primary in 1986, only the second Black in the history of the country to win a major party nomination for governor. He ran on a platform that stressed the historic nature of his candidacy, fiscal responsibility, and law and order, but lost the general election to the incumbent, Governor James Blanchard.</p>
      <p>Lucas married his wife Evelyn while he was in high school. They have five children, three of whom are physicians. William Lucas currently (1987) works for a law firm in Detroit.</p>

      <p>The William Lucas Papers consist of manuscript and audiovisual materials which primarily document economic and social affairs in Wayne County, when Lucas served as county executive, and Lucas's campaign for governor in 1986. There are few materials on Lucas's career prior to his service as Wayne County executive. His gubernatorial campaign is documented in a somewhat piecemeal fashion, and study of it would be enhanced by the use of oral interviews. Media coverage of the campaign, however, has been preserved quite thoroughly. The Lucas Papers (34 linear feet) are comprised of six series: Personal, Wayne County Offices, Political, Clippings, Videotapes, and Photographs.</p>

          <p>The Personal series (2 folders) is the one to which the researcher should turn to learn about the many phases of Lucas's career. It contains biographical materials in the form of articles, resumes, membership certificates, and promotional materials on several of his children. One of the more interesting documents is a 1970 questionnaire filled out by Lucas for the Manhattan College Magazine. In it he discusses his collegiate experiences and how they shaped the principles and philosophies which guided him later in life. The series also contains materials related to Lucson Petroleum Corporation, of which Lucas was an original incorporator. The corporation was in the oil refining and distributing industry.</p>

          <p>The Wayne County Offices series (1 linear foot) is divided into two subseries, one for each of the major county offices Lucas held, sheriff and county executive. They are arranged alphabetically by topic. The sheriff subseries contains materials which mostly pertain to major incidents which occurred while Lucas was in office. They include the battle between Lucas and Wayne County Commissioners over elimination of the Patrol and Investigation Division, and the "Rochester Incident" which involved a shootout between Wayne County sheriffs and Detroit policemen. There is also a very interesting transcript of the "Pingree Street Conspiracy Trial" of 1975, in which Detroit policemen and private citizens were tried for the sale of narcotics and conspiracy to obstruct justice.</p>
          <p>In the county executive subseries, five folders of manuscript materials contain scattered documents on Lucas's tenure. The correspondence file includes Lucas's responses to a variety of constituent concerns, and the interoffice memos provide a cursory look at media strategy, and budget and union contract issues during Lucas's first months in office. The researcher will note newsclippings and videotapes relating Lucas' work as Wayne County executive are filed in the Clippings and Tapes series. They are extremely important to any study of Lucas as county executive.</p>

It is also arranged alphabetically by topic, and while the manuscript materials do not provide in-depth coverage of the campaign, the researcher will benefit from use of the folders on finances, which in report form document early efforts to raise campaign funds; issues; speeches; and surveys of issues and voter preferences. There are again cross references to the important Clippings and Videotapes series.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Clippings series (10 linear feet) is a very comprehensive run of' newspaper coverage of Lucas's tenure as county executive and his political activities, including the gubernatorial campaign. The bulk of the series is comprised of clippings from the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News, but there is often coverage from other major papers around the state as well. The series is arranged chronologically, beginning in January 1983, and ending in November 1986. It is complete, with the exception of May and June 1986, for which clippings were not received. It is a valuable series on which to rely for developing a chronology of important events for those years, following the reaction around the state to his entrance into the Republican Party, and charting public opinion on his campaign for governor.</p>

          <p>The Videotapes series (21 linear feet) is the largest in the collection and is divided into three subseries. The Wayne County Executive subseries contains a run of public affairs programs entitled, "Wayne County: A New Perspective," which were produced while Lucas was county executive. They are videotapes and are arranged alphabetically by title. They cover an enormous range of topics and provide insight into economic and social concerns of the 1980s in one of the largest counties in the country. The form is generally that of a panel discussion on the topic by several area specialists, and often includes information on county programs overseen and/or initiated by Lucas. The researcher should consult the contents list to determine programs of interest. This subseries also contains a miscellaneous set of both audio and video tapes of activities of Executive Lucas, including various press conferences, speeches, and talk show appearances.</p>
          <p>The political subseries of the Videotapes series is arranged alphabetically by topic and consists of video tapes of phases of his gubernatorial campaign. Among the more interesting are his announcements of joining the Republican party and entering the governor's race, the Detroit Economic Club debate with James Blanchard, promotional spots used to develop voter loyalty and explain his stances on issues, and talk show appearances.</p>
          <p>The third subseries, labeled "Masters," are videotapes comprised of evening news segments from the ABC, CBS, and NBC affiliates in Detroit which focus on Lucas from the early months of 1984 to November 1986. While the emphasis is on his political activities, there is also very good coverage of his tenure as Wayne County executive. When used with the Political series and the Clippings series, the researcher is provided almost complete media coverage of Lucas's activities from 1983 through 1986.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series (1 linear foot) includes images of Lucas and his family in the 1970s and 1980s, one snapshot taken while he was a special agent for the FBI, and a series of images from his tenure as Wayne County sheriff. The majority of the series, however, consists of photographs taken during his campaign for governor. They are arranged alphabetically by topic, and the researcher is advised to consult the contents list for specific images of interest.</p>
