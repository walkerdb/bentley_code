          <p>The series Family Groups covers 170 years of the Pierson Family and consists of family correspondence, legal papers, genealogical research, and newspaper clippings. The series has been arranged by generation, which is subdivided by Personal Name. Each generation has been made into its own sub-series. The sub-series First Generation contains papers of lawyer and politician Job Pierson (1791-1860), which include formal dinner invitations, cemetery deed, certificate to practice law in New York, and biographical material post dating his death. The sub-series Second Generation contains the papers of the children of Job Pierson (1791-1860) and his wife Clarissa Taintor Bulkeley. While Job and Clarissa Pierson had five children, only two, Job Pierson (1824-1896) and John Bulkeley Pierson (1828-1885) are represented in this series. The papers of Reverend Job Pierson include his heavily annotated bible, correspondence, a photocopied version of his diary, legal and financial papers, and biographical material post dating his death. Job Pierson's correspondence includes communications between himself and family members as well as correspondences from Nathaniel and Frank Topping dealing with various financial and legal matters. The sub-series also contains the papers of Job Pierson's wife Rachel Williams Smith. The sub-series Third Generation contains the papers of the children of Job and Rachel Pierson. The Fourth Generation and Fifth Generation sub-series represent the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Reverend Job Pierson accordingly. The series also contains the sub-series Other Families. This sub-series is made up of genealogical research on families related to the Pierson family.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The series Clara D. Pierson (1868-1952) Papers documents the life and activities of Clara Dillingham Pierson, the wife of Reverend Job Pierson's son John W.S. Pierson. The series consists chiefly of letters written by Clara to her mother Jennie Lincoln Dillingham between 1887 and 1910. The letters describe the daily activities and major events in Clara's life from her days as a student in Chicago and teacher at Alma College, to her courtship and subsequent marriage to John W.S. Pierson, the couple's life in Stanton, Michigan and later, the adoption of their sons John Howard and Harold Pierson. Clara D. Pierson has written on some of the envelopes describing the contents of the letters. For example, on the envelope of a letter from May 1888, Clara D. Pierson has written, "These [letters] from Ann Arbor where I relocated for the Commencement rush sound pretty frivolous but it was all clean fun and every one of the young men mentioned would have been glad to introduce me to the girl he married later." Other papers in this series include drafts and published versions of Clara D. Pierson's writings, correspondence with various friends and family members, genealogical research, newspaper clippings, legal and financial papers, and Clara D. Pierson's autobiography.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series complements the manuscript and printed materials contained in the collection's other series. The visual materials include ambrotypes and daguerreotypes, ink drawings, photographs, prints, postcards, and tintypes. Most of the Pierson Family photographs are formal portraits rather than casual snapshots of various members of the Pierson family. Additionally, the series contains photographs of various houses owned by Pierson family members. The Pierson Family farmhouse located in Long Island, New York is thoroughly documented as there was an album containing a photograph of every room in that house.</p>
