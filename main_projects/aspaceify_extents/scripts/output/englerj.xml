      <abstract>Republican member of the Michigan state legislature (House and Senate, 1971-1990); governor of Michigan (1991-2003); active member of the Republican Governors' Association and the National Governors' Association. The Engler collection consists primarily of materials created and maintained by Governor Engler and his staff during the period when he was governor, 1991-2003. Other records include papers from his several terms in the Michigan House and the Michigan Senate.
The collection includes papers files, photographs, sound recordings, videotapes, memorabilia, and some electronic files.
The gubernatorial files are arranged mainly by unit or functional responsibility within the governor's office. These series are Executive Office, Communications Division, Legal Division, State Government Affairs, Legislative Affairs Division, Operations Division, External Affairs, Scheduling, Washington DC Office, and Office of the First Lady.
Topics extensively documented include state welfare and school funding reform, reorganization of state boards and commissions, notably the restructuring of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and Republican party politics.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>When John Engler became Michigan's governor in 1991, he brought with him a classically conservative vision of a smaller, more efficient government, and of a state where taxes were lower, individual initiative was rewarded and business and opportunity could thrive. As Michigan's governor during the boom years of the 1990's, Engler led the state during a period of uncommon prosperity between 1991 and 2002. At the beginning of his tenure, however, Michigan's economy was less than ideal.</p>
      <p>After defeating incumbent James Blanchard in 1990 in an upset election, Engler inherited a $1.8 billion deficit. He embarked on an effort to cut spending and taxes, and reorganized the government. His first term spending cuts were painful and controversial, and included cuts in welfare for childless adults, state mental-health facilities, and arts programs. In the aftermath, Engler was widely viewed as a cold-hearted bureaucrat who was more concerned with balancing budgets than with the pain and suffering of poor people. But as it turned out, Michigan was on the vanguard of a national movement to change welfare, putting more focus on work. By the time Engler sought re-election in 1994, none of the three Democrats seeking the nomination proposed a return to the General Assistance Program.</p>
      <p>In his effort to achieve greater efficiency in state government, Engler presided over the most dramatic restructuring of state government in a generation. He eliminated entire departments and abolished dozens of boards and commissions. He pushed the power of the Executive Branch to the fullest extent permitted by the Michigan Constitution to implement his reorganizations.</p>
      <p>In 1995 Engler split the Michigan Department of Natural Resources into a parks and recreation-oriented DNR, and a new Department of Environmental Quality, charged with monitoring pollution and public health. The changes were controversial because critics claimed they interfered with citizen oversight.</p>
      <p>He also created the Michigan Jobs Commission and later, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. With an aggressive business attraction strategy and a locally driven job training system, Michigan managed to attract many new job-creating businesses. In fact, Michigan earned the prestigious "Governor's Cup" -- representing the nation's number one state for new factories and expansion projects -- a record-setting four years in a row (1997-2000).</p>
      <p>But education reform was Engler's top priority. He led the campaign to win citizen approval for Proposal A -- a 1994 ballot initiative that radically changed the way Michigan's public schools are funded. By loosening the connection between local property taxes and school funding, he aimed to make per-student funding more fair. And even though Proposal A slashed homeowners local property school tax rates by an average of 45%, school spending grew during Engler's tenure, from about $8 billion annually to nearly $12 billion--benefiting from booming tax revenues during the bountiful 1990's.</p>
      <p>Engler also championed school choice, charter schools and more competition as part of his plan to help Michigan schools improve. His administration focused on high standards, more accountability, tough tests, improved safety and more discipline to help Michigan's students learn better.</p>
      <p>Engler also saw the power of technology to create jobs and better people's lives. As the first governor to have a website, he pushed for increased availability of high-speed broadband Internet, and supported the creation of the nation's first on-line cybercourts. He also introduced a program to distribute laptop computers to more than 88,000 K-12 teachers statewide.</p>
      <p>Engler was Chairman of the Republican Governors' Association in 1996 and of the National Governor's Association July 2001 to July 2002. He was a member of the Advisory Board of the Republican National Leadership Council and was considered a top-seeded candidate for Bob Dole's Vice Presidential running-mate in 1996.</p>
      <p>John Engler was born October 12, 1948, the oldest of Mathias and Agnes Engler's seven children. His parents raised cattle on 900 acres near Beal City, Michigan and John majored in agricultural economics at Michigan State University. As a class project for a political science class, Engler wrote a paper outlining his strategy for winning a Republican primary against an incumbent for a seat in the state legislature. In 1970, before graduating, he enlisted the help of his friend, sophomore Dick Posthumus, and put his plan into action. He won the primary, and the general election to become, at age 22, the youngest Michigan legislator. Indeed, in his thirty-year political career, John Engler never lost an election.</p>
      <p>The Republicans were the minority party in the Michigan House when Engler set out in 1971, although Republican William Milliken controlled the governor's office. Engler served eight years in the House and twelve years in the Michigan Senate, rising to become Senate Majority Leader in 1984 after leading an intense effort to tip the balance toward the GOP. While serving in the legislature, Engler attended law school part-time and received his degree from Thomas Cooley Law School in 1981.</p>
      <p>He married fellow lawmaker Colleen House in 1975, though they divorced in 1986. He wed again to attorney Michelle DeMunbrun in 1990. They are the parents of triplet daughters, Margaret, Hannah and Madeleine, born November 13, 1994, just days after his reelection to a second gubernatorial term.</p>

      <p>The John Engler papers are the most important source available for the study of Michigan's state government from 1991 to 2002. The collection is particularly strong on the topics of welfare and school funding reform, state government reorganization and the rising impact of the National Governors' Association in state and national politics. Engler's efforts to attract commerce to Michigan are also well-documented. The materials are arranged into two main subgroups: Pre-gubernatorial Papers and Gubernatorial Papers. The bulk of the material relates to Engler's gubernatorial career, therefore, the analysis that follows focuses primarily on this subgroup.</p>
      <p>The materials in the "Gubernatorial Papers" subgroup are arranged according to the offices and subdivisions of the governor's office that created them. This means that the governor's speeches and press releases, for example, may be found within a grouping or "series" called "Communications Division," within the "Gubernatorial" subgroup, while legislative histories for various public acts may be found within the "Legislative Affairs" series.</p>
      <p>While some kinds of documents were produced uniquely by one division, other kinds were produced in several divisions of the governor's office. The governor's correspondence, for example, was drafted and approved by several different staff members. Letters to important business and political leaders may be found within the "Executive Office" series, the "State Government Affairs" series, and the "Washington DC Office" series in particular. There no comprehensive chronological correspondence file.</p>
      <p>In using the collection, the researcher should think functionally and ask who would have created the information sought. For example, the policy advisors in the State Government Affairs Division created individual topical files which gathered together correspondence and research materials to support briefing memoranda which they presented to the governor, while the speechwriters in the Communications Division often gathered different types of materials to help them shape the presentation of the same policies to the public.</p>

              <p>The "Michigan Senatorial Trust" subseries contains high quality material documenting Engler's effort to change the method of financing campaigns of Republican challengers for Michigan Senate seats. While working toward a Republican majority and his own rise as majority leader, Engler elicited both resistance and mistrust from the Republican establishment as the records collected here show.</p>

                <p>Material found in the "Memoranda and Miscellaneous" subsubseries was accumulated by the Governor's archivist from many different sources. Most of the records from the Governor's Office first term had been destroyed. Since the Chief of Staff for the first term also destroyed his files, and first term materials for the Policy Office (State Government Affairs) are not substantial, these materials, comprising one linear foot, represent a scattering of information from the period 1990-1995. The researcher interested in the first term would probably do better to consult the materials interfiled with the governor's schedules and speeches to determine his policy positions and priorities.</p>

Within the files of Rachel Siglow are materials relating to Engler's activities as chair of the National Governors' Association, 2001-2002. The files for individual governors do not contain correspondence with each of the governors listed, but rather a record of each governor's service contributions to the NGA and a page of "talking points" regarding each state's position on standardized testing and accountability in education.</p>

              <p>The Chief of Staff subseries includes files of deputy chief of staff Carol Viventi and chief of staff Sharon Rothwell. The files of first term chief of staff Dan Pero (1991-1994) were destroyed. As a substitute, the papers of the deputy chief of staff have some, albeit limited, research value. The researcher can find more substantive memoranda from the deputy within the files of the Director of State Government Affairs. This subseries also contains briefing books and some polling reports. Additional polling studies will be found in the "Campaigns" series.</p>

            <p>Although the reporting relationship of the speechwriters shifted between the Communications office and the External (Public) Affairs office, the papers of John Nevin and Gleaves Whitney have been gathered together here in the Communications Division series for ease of reference, and for continuity's sake. Throughout their employment, they served as speechwriters and so their papers have a unity based on function in support of that work. The papers of Rusty Hills, however, will be found in both the Communications and the Public Affairs Division Series, because he served as the Director of Communications for Engler's first term, and then as Director of the newly repurposed Director of Public Affairs for the second term.</p>
            <p>The Communications Division series has been arranged into the following subseries: Press releases; News clips; John Nevin files; Gleaves Whitney files; John Truscott files; Speeches, Videotapes; and Sound Recordings.</p>

              <p>The files of Gleaves Whitney consist of topical and other files documenting his various activities as a speechwriter, administrative historian, and Engler biographer. The "Topical files," though transferred to the Bentley Library under Whitney's name, appear to have been originally created by Engler's first Communications Director, Rusty Hills, and then inherited and augmented by Whitney. These files relate to the development of Engler's public message. Within topical, the "Affirmative Action" file contains a memo which formulates language for replies to constituents who contact the Governor's office regarding the University of Michigan's affirmative action suits. The "All Departments" file contains the suggestions of the Directors of State Departments about "the most important thing the federal government can do to help your department" in anticipation of Bob Dole's election as president. The eight "Engler, John" files demonstrate the molding of Engler's public image. Memos describing the expected political impact of the School Choice/Vouchers referendum on the 2000 presidential election, in the "School of Choice" and "Vouchers" files are valuable because sharing a ballot with the referendum was seen as being an important reason why George W. Bush failed to carry Michigan in the 2000 election.</p>
              <p>Whitney's "Speeches" files contain his research and drafts of speeches. They are in chronological order. For the text of speeches as revised by Engler himself, see the "Speeches" subseries of the Communications Division series described below.</p>
              <p>The "Authorized History" files were files created in support of Whitney's book <title render="italic">John Engler: The Man, the Leader, the Legacy.</title> These files are a microcosm of the entire Engler collection, and a researcher can get a quick tour of the highlights of the Engler administration by beginning his or her research here. There is original material here, which Whitney gathered from other parts of the collection. For example, there are the original drafts for the State of the State for 1992. There are also newspaper clippings, bumper stickers, and correspondence. The "Bibliography" file includes a bibliography of Engler's written works as well as citations from Whitney's book.</p>

            <p>The Legal Division provided legal advice to the Governor about pending state lawsuits, ethics, Freedom of Information and Open Meetings Acts, and elections.

It oversaw the relationship of the state with Michigan's Native American tribes and drafted Executive Orders and Directives. It also was responsible for emergency management and security, and its duties include briefing the Governor on September 11, 2001.</p>
            <p>The subseries in the Legal Division include Executive Orders; Executive directives and proclamations; Executive clemency; Judicial appointments; Litigation; Topical files; Indians - state tribal affairs; Legal Counsel and Deputy Legal Counsel files; Redistricting; and Judicial appointments.</p>

            <p>The primary mission of the State Government Affairs Division (52 lin. ft.) in the Engler administration was to coordinate the development and implementation of state governmental policy and programs. The SGA Director served as the principal liaison between the Governor's Office and the Cabinet Members, Department Directors, and Agency Heads on matters pertaining to development, analysis, and implementation of policy and programs. Individual policy coordinators were responsible for acting as liaisons between the Governor's Office and their assigned departments. The records in this series represent the best way to access the important policy decisions made during Engler's three terms.</p>

              <p>During the first term, the "Policy Office" (5 lin. ft.) was led by Dennis Schornack. During later administrations, Schornack became the Governor's Senior Policy Advisor, (though he also temporarily led the Department of Community Health). He was not then technically a part of the State Government Affairs office, but functionally aided in the generation and implementation of policy. His papers are therefore placed here in the State Government Affairs Division, for ease of access for the researcher. Schornack's "Governor Engler Correspondence" files for 1991-1994 are important documents for understanding policy decisions for the Governor's first term. Other important projects Schornack coordinated include "Annex 2001" which was a proposal to amend the Great lakes Charter to regulate the diversion of Great Lakes Water; the Michigan Commission on End of Life Care, the Michigan Commission on Genetic Privacy, the sale of the Michigan Biologic Products Institute (manufacturer of vaccines) and the development of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve.</p>

              <p>The "Office of the Director" files maintained by Dennis Schornack, Manny Lentine, and Brian DeBano contain Governor's signature correspondence on topics concerning state government agencies, arranged alphabetically by correspondent. The Director's "Department Issues," contain annual alphabetical files for of all the state departments. The key issues affecting those departments will be represented here, which makes these files an important resource. This subseries also contains the documents which proposed and implemented state departmental reorganizations and early retirement restructuring. The documents in the "Cabinet Vision Planning Retreat" subseries were created to prepare a platform for the 1998 campaign. Each department analyzed pending issues to discern and explain potential problem areas, accomplishments, and policy objectives for Governor's coming third term.</p>

                <p>The Director's "Transition Manuals" subseries is an uncommonly good resource for understanding the structure and function of the Governor's Office and the State Government at the end of the Engler Administration. Prepared to ease the transition to Governor Jennifer Granholm's administration in January, 2003, they contain nutshell summaries of Governor's office structure, the missions and responsibilities of each of the divisions and sub-offices, staffing, budget, and unfinished business.</p>

            <p>The records of the "Legislative Affairs Division" demonstrate the executive branch's impact on the legislative history of Michigan's laws. Files are arranged by Public Act number, which is also a chronological ordering by the governor's signing date. After the governor signs a new act, the law will be inserted into the state's legal code <title render="italic">Michigan Compiled Laws</title>, and will usually be thereafter referred to by its MCL number. Usually, therefore, a researcher seeking a legislative history of a particular law would locate the statute within <title render="italic">Michigan Compiled Laws</title> to find the cross reference to its Public Act number. Accessing the original Public Act will show what the law looked like when it was enacted (and not as eventually amended.) The website for the Michigan Legislature presents the text of Public Acts since 1997 (http://www.michiganlegislature.org/mileg.asp?page=PublicActs.)</p>

Prior to mounting his campaign, John Engler, John Kost of the Michigan Senate Majority Office and Jill Murphy executed an intensive research project to document Engler's political history, compiling his votes and speeches in the legislature, and his press coverage. They also researched Engler's potential opponents for the Republican nomination.</p>

              <p>The records of the "Transition Team" (3.3 lin. ft.) were created by the team led by Richard McLellan, Carol Viventi and William Whitbeck. The material is highly organized and useful to determine organization, staffing, funding and mission of the Governor's Office and Michigan state departments at the beginning of Engler's tenure. The materials from the departments were gathered through interviews with officials and employees, but while the reports contain summaries of information learned, they do not name informants.</p>

              <p>The files of the "Bush/Quayle '92 Campaign" (1 lin. ft.) accumulated by Dave Bertram are not decision-making documents. Researchers interested in Engler's role in the campaign should look to his "Communications" series, which contains his speeches, and photographs and videos of the visits of the President. The speechwriters' background files may provide additional interesting information. A researcher should also obtain Engler's daily schedule from the "Schedules" series for the days of the candidate's visits. These records will contain the briefing materials prepared for Engler for that day and the speeches.</p>

            <p>The "External Affairs" division (also called "Public Affairs") underwent several changes during Engler's administrations. Its function was to answer routine constituent mail and to send congratulatory letters in connection with events such as organizational anniversaries, 100th birthdays, national conventions and so forth. The aides in this office also fulfilled political functions and maintained connections with the governor's important supporters. During his second term, Engler's speechwriters were transferred from the Communications Division to this division, together with former Communications Director Rusty Hills, who became the new External Affairs Director. For the third term, the speechwriters were moved back to Communications. For ease of access in using the Engler collection, the speechwriters files have all been consolidated within the "Communications" series. This includes substantial material generated by Rusty Hills, whose files were apparently inherited and added to by Gleaves Whitney and were transferred to the Bentley under the aegis of the Communications Division.</p>
            <p>Some of Rusty Hill papers have been retained within the External Affairs division, together with those of Tim Ward. Hills papers were received unfoldered, and thus the file categories and captions are those of the archivist, not of Hills himself. Tim Ward's files are largely political in nature, and touch on relationships with other politicians, elections, fundraising, and communication of political agendas.</p>

            <p>The series is complete except for brief breaks for campaigning. For these breaks, the research should consult the "Schedules" subseries within the records of various campaigns. Engler's daily schedule includes an itinerary, briefing materials, proposed remarks and meeting agendas. They are a valuable resource, particularly for the Engler's first term in office for which other records are not extant. Engler's Master Datebooks may be found in Box 392.</p>

From July 2000 to July 2001 Engler was Vice-Chair of NGA and Chair of its Center for Best Practices and he was NGA Chair from July 2001 to July 2002. The NGA operated from the same building in which the State of Michigan's Washington DC Office was located. The Washington DC Office's newsletter, "State of Michigan Washington Report" is also a good source for examining Michigan's lobbying efforts.</p>

            <p>The papers document Michelle Engler's efforts in support of volunteerism, including the records of various charity boards she sat on or chaired. Her "Event" files include briefing materials for each of the listed events. Her "Casework" subseries contains a sampling of the efforts of the Office of the First Lady to respond to constituent's needs by connecting them with resources, or recognizing their achievements. Within this subseries, the "Vision Meeting" file is particularly interesting as it documents an effort to revise the First Lady's role and image. Her "Photographs" subseries documents the public life of the First Lady, but does not attempt to record her private life.</p>

            <p>While the governor was still in office, Fr. Christopher Kelley, the Governor's Archivist, solicited original materials from various state departments for inclusion in the collection that would eventually come to the Bentley Library. He asked department personnel for documents which bore the Governor's handwriting, or which bore other specific indications of John Engler's input or advice. Some of the folders contain lists of the important leaders and policy makers in each of the departments and bureaus during Engler's tenure in office. In general, however, the material in the "State Government Affairs" series contains more valuable documentation of the relationship of the governor to the state departments.</p>
            <p>There are a few files from the Northern Michigan Office of the Governor and the Southeastern Michigan Office contained in this series, but in general the work of these offices is not well documented in this collection. For information about Detroit, the researcher should search the finding aid for the term "urban agenda" or consult the briefings for the Engler's meetings with Mayor Dennis Archer.</p>

            <p>This series consolidates all of the electronic media found within the collection. It includes 3.5 inch floppy disks (including a copy of Gleaves Whitney's Biography of Engler,) Zip disks, CD Rom's and URL's linking this finding aid to archived versions of the Governor's website. The electronic files include spreadsheets, digital photographs and text documents.</p>
            <p>The "Website Archive" subseries (2,686 digital records, 11.58 MB) 1991-2001, consists of two subseries Executive Orders and Press Releases and Executive Appointments. The Executive Order subseries, 1991-2001, is organized by executive order number, date issued, and topic. Access to the digital records are first by year and then by order number or topic.</p>
            <p>The Press Releases and Executive Appointments, 1995-2000, are arranged by month and year. Press Releases are accessed by the title of the press release. For example, in 1998 one press release includes <title render="italic">Governor Engler Announces Expansion of Project Zero.</title> The original date of the release is included on every press release. The arrangement of the Executive Office Appointments is similar to the Press Releases. Access is first by year ant then by the title of the announcement. For example, in the directory for the year 2000 one appointment includes, <title render="italic">Governor Engler Appoints Wheatley as Director of Michigan Unemployment Agency.</title></p>
            <p>The "Digital Photographs of Presentation Materials" subseries (1 CD Rom) contains images of a sampling of large format posters and presentation materials which Engler used during press conferences and speaking events. A researcher interested in these materials should also consult the videotapes of the press events, which illustrate how Engler employed the materials during his talks.</p>
