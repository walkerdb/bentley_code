    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Deane Baker was born in Marquette, Michigan on April 29, 1925. As a young man he completed two stints in the Air Force, from 1943 to 1945 and 1951-1953. Between these two periods of military service he completed his Bachelors degree in Business Administration at the University of Wisconsin in 1949 and married Marilyn Jane Hesse in 1951. After he completed his military service Baker entered the M.B.A. program at Harvard University, graduating in 1955.</p>
      <p>After serving as the president of the Detroit-based H.F. Campbell Company and its subsidiaries, Baker founded the Deane Baker Company (later Ann Arbor Group, Inc.), a commercial and residential development and real estate firm.</p>
      <p>In addition to his business interests and pursuits, Baker became active in state Republican Party politics in the 1960s, serving as a member of the Michigan for Milliken committee, and heading the Milliken campaign committee in Michigan's Second Congressional District. He also served as the Vice-Chairman of both the Washtenaw County and Scio Township Republican Parties, served on numerous political committees, and attended a number of State Republican conventions. Governor William Milliken appointed Baker to the Grand Valley State University Board of Control, on which Baker served from 1969-1972. In addition to his involvement in local politics, Baker ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 1976 and 1982.</p>
      <p>In 1970 Baker unsuccessfully ran for a spot on the University of Michigan Board of Regents, the main governing body of the University. Though he failed to win his party's nomination in 1970, he did win his 1972 bid, beginning his 24-year tenure as a University Regent. In his time as Regent, Baker proved to be one of the most active, and also controversial members of the board, providing a dissenting conservative voice on the overwhelmingly Democratic board. He was involved in the selection of three University presidents, and helped to lead the University through major shifts in University operation and policy, such as the drafting of a new sexual orientation and discrimination policy, the decision as to whether to divest stock holdings with businesses doing business in South Africa before the fall of Apartheid, and the construction of the new University replacement hospital complex.</p>
      <p>In addition to his business and political interests, Deane Baker was recognized for his religious and civic engagement and activities. He received Businessman of the Year Award, construction category, from Religious Heritage of America; received Business citizenship Award from Business Week magazine; Board of Directors Economic Club of Detroit and Laymen's National Bible Committee; he was an Elder in the First Presbyterian Church, Ann Arbor; a former director of Detroit Chamber of Commerce, Employers Association of Detroit, Detroit Rotary Club, Ann Arbor Senior Citizens Guild, Detroit Urban League; trustee, Historical Society of Michigan; former President Laymen's National Bible Committee; twice president Detroit Urban League. He and his wife Marilyn had three daughters Jamie, Wendy, Betsy; and one son, John.</p>

      <p>The Deane Baker collection consists primarily of documentation of his campaigns for political office and his service as Regent of the University of Michigan. As the Bentley Library has a separate collection of Board of Regents records, the focus of the Deane Baker collection has been in those areas of university policy, procedure, and programs of most concern to him. The researcher is directed to the files of the Board of Regents and administrative offices of the university for the fullest description of Board of Regents history during the Baker years. Other portions of the collection relate to his various campaigns for public office. There is also a sampling of his other business and personal activities.</p>

          <p>The Regental Files series contains correspondence, meeting notes, and other materials related to Baker's tenure as Regent of the University of Michigan. These files are organized by date, but within the chronological structure Baker maintained certain topical files on major issues facing the board such as South African divestment and files related to the construction of a new university hospital. Baker kept copies of his incoming and outgoing correspondence, making the correspondence files of this series particularly rich. Additional content relating to the university's sexual orientation policies is in a separate series University of Michigan Bylaw 14.06 (Nondiscrimination policy).</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The series University of Michigan Bylaw 14.06 (Nondiscrimination policy) contains documentation on controversies on campus in the early to mid-1990s surrounding sexual orientation, particularly the amendment of Regents Bylaw 14.06 (Nondiscrimination) in 1993-94 to include non-discrimination based on sexual orientation. Baker's outspoken conservative position opposing the bylaw amendment made him a lightning rod in the debates. Baker's files richly illustrate the divisive nature of these debates as the files contain material from supporters and detractors. The files include newspaper clippings, correspondence, petitions sent to Regents, and background articles on gay issues and homosexuality. Material from other gay rights issues in the early 1990s is also included relating to counseling services offered by the Lesbian-Gay Male Program Office (LGMPO) and efforts to change the definition of family as it related to University of Michigan Family Housing in 1991. The organization ACT-UP staged a protest at Baker's residence in 1990. Clippings and material relating to the protest is also included.</p>

          <p>The Book Project series contains proposals, notes and background material from an unrealized project to write a monograph about university policy making from an insider's perspective. The files contain chapter outlines and some brief summaries. The material is organized as it was maintained by Baker, reflecting a scheme he devised to match his proposed chapters. Files include background source material such as clippings, statements, and correspondence. Topics include Baker's relations with various University of Michigan presidents, other regents, and significant topics such as speech codes, political correctness, sexual orientation and affirmative action.</p>
