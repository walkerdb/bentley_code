      <p>Psychology as a separate course of study was not recognized in the United States until the last quarter of the nineteenth century. At the University of Michigan, the Department of Psychology was officially formed in 1929, but instruction in psychology or "Mental Philosophy" as it was called, was available from the Department of Philosophy from 1852. Many prominent figures in early American psychology taught at the University of Michigan. President Tappan, who was Professor of Mental Philosophy as well as president of the university, taught courses in mental philosophy from 1852 to 1863. Other important figures include John Dewey who established the first psychological laboratory, and George Herbert Mead and James H. Tufts, who each briefly held positions at the school in the 1890s. Walter Pillsbury, the first professor to be appointed to the newly separated Department of Psychology, revived laboratory psychology in 1898 and headed the department from 1929 to 1942. He built its reputation as an excellent teaching department with a research emphasis on experimental psychology.</p>
      <p>The department boomed after World War II as it began to take on its modern attributes: a large staff, many professors engaged in interdisciplinary research, a large number of graduate students, and a nationally ranked program. Much of the credit for this growth and diversification is credited to the work of Donald G. Marquis, Department Chairman from 1945 to 1957.</p>
      <p>In the early 1960s the department introduced sub-disciplines to facilitate communication between faculty and students in the huge department. These sub-disciplines also allowed students to specialize within a field of study that was growing more and more diverse. The sub-disciplines grew to include experimental, clinical, community, physiological, mathematical, personality, social, psychobiology (neuroscience), developmental, industrial, and general psychology.</p>
      <p>In recent years the growth has slowed, but the national reputation and solid work done in clinical, social, and mathematical psychology endure. The Department of Psychology at this time is one of the largest departments of the university and boasts some of the highest class enrollments at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>

      <p>The records of the University of Michigan Department of Psychology document the department from its beginnings, through a period of rapid growth after World War II, to its present standing as a diverse and well established division of the University of Michigan. The first accession of materials from the department was received in 1990 and consisted of about 5 linear inches. Four linear feet of materials have now been added forming one integrated run of records.</p>
      <p>The materials are arranged into eight series: History, Administrative Committees, Budget, Course Materials, Sub-disciplines, Topical Administrative Files, Faculty, and Students.</p>

          <p>The History series (0.5 linear feet, 1936-1986) consists of organizational documents, publications, reports, reviews, and speeches. These materials are especially useful for obtaining a general sense of the department and the conditions and standards under which it functions.</p>
          <p>The publication, reports, and reviews contain summary information on the accomplishments of the department and goals for the future. They document the history of the department and the different directions it has taken. The reviews in particular are a strength of this series, providing frank appraisals of various strengths and weaknesses.</p>
          <p>The State of the Department Speeches, given by Wilbert McKeachie from 1961 to 1970, are perhaps the best sources of summary information. They exemplify the spirit of self-review and analysis that seemed to characterize the administrative life of the department. They also provide insight into the mentality of the department and trends in policy, curriculum, and research during a highly formative decade. All of these materials may be a good beginning for general research even though they are not comprehensive, leaving many time periods and activities unaccounted for.</p>
          <p>Also located within this series are two photographs of the psychology laboratories as they stood from 1903 to 1915.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Committees series (3 linear feet, 1960-1989) includes materials created by the department-wide, policy-making bodies. This is mostly material from the Executive Committee and Staff Meetings although there is also some minimal information created by the Ad Hoc Committee on Departmental Structure and Function, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, and the Committee on Graduate Studies.</p>
          <p>The Administrative Committees series deals mostly with everyday activities and issues of curriculum, policy, and research as well as faculty and student enrollment, placement, funding, and graduation. The Executive Committee meeting minutes are excellent in that they run from 1960 to 1998 with few chronological gaps. All of the records are organized into two sub-series, 1960-1989 and 1983-1998, and arranged chronologically under the title of the committee.</p>

          <p>The Budget series (0.25 linear feet, 1972-1988) has been retained because of its summary financial information. Some of the materials one might find here are annual total expenditures, percentages of the budget received from the University or outside sources, percentages of the budget used by each sub-discipline on a yearly or 5-year basis, and possible sources of funding for equipment, scholarships, etc. Because the information in this series is extremely varied and offers only fragmentary documentation, it has been arranged in a simple chronological order.</p>

          <p>The Course Materials series (0.25 linear feet, 1930-1977) documents only a few of the courses offered in the Department of Psychology. Most of the classes represented in this collection are part of the social psychology sub-discipline. Class materials are divided by title and include exams, syllabi, and course outlines. Many of these class materials span a number of years making it apparent to see how specific courses have changed in focus, curriculum, or approach.</p>
          <p>Of special interest in this series are 2 folders of handwritten lecture notes, most likely from Walter Pillsbury, the first professor of psychology distinct from philosophy at this university. They cover a variety of different topics including mysticism, the psychology of religion, and adolescence.</p>

          <p>The Sub-discipline series (3 linear feet, 1969-1991) consists of information relating to each separate course of study within the department. Documentation for each of these areas include committee minutes, correspondence, organizational information, reviews, and evaluations. The subdivisions seem to have acted as autonomous bodies within the department, making their own decisions regarding curriculum, enrollments, budget allocations, and other administrative activities. Larger administrative decisions were often made jointly with the executive committee (see Administrative Committees series for minutes). The sub-disciplinary areas for which the Bentley Historical Library holds materials are Applied, Clinical, Combined, Community, Developmental, Experimental, Mathematical, Organizational, Personality, Psychobiology, and Social Psychology. Materials are arranged into two sub-series: 1969-1985 and 1973-1991.</p>

          <p>The Topical Administrative Files (2 linear feet, 1944-1997) is a correspondence file organized alphabetically by subject. These files are comprised of two sub-series: 1944-1985 and 1973-1991. It includes correspondence about such things as community and affiliated programs, minority students, and policy implementation. The topical file is scanty but does indicate the diversity of the programs and affiliations of the Department of Psychology both within the university and the Ann Arbor community in general.</p>

          <p>The Students series (0.25 linear feet, 1966-1988) consists of materials pertaining primarily to student concerns. While it is the smallest series it is interesting in that it represents the students themselves - a group that is often not reflected in the other materials.</p>
