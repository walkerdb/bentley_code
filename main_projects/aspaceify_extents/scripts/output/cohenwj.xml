    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Wilbur Cohen was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1913. Following his graduation in 1934 from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in economics, he went to Washington to work for Edwin E Witte, who was then directing President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Committee on Economic Security, which was responsible for drafting the first Social Security Act. Cohen joined the newly-formed Social Security Board in 1935 and stayed in the government for two decades, ending in 1956 when he retired as director of the Board's Division of Research and Statistics. That year, he joined the University of Michigan as a professor of public welfare administration, a position he held until 1961.</p>
      <p>After the election of President John F. Kennedy, Cohen returned to Washington, taking the position of assistant secretary for legislation in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In 1965, he was elevated to the position of undersecretary in the department, and in 1968 was appointed to be secretary of HEW by President Lyndon Johnson.</p>
      <p>In 1969, he returned to the University of Michigan, taking the post of dean in the School of Education. During his deanship at the University of Michigan, Cohen was appointed to chair the Task Force on the Prevention and Investigation of Abuse in State Institutions by Governor William G. Milliken. Cohen accepted the charge in early March 1978, and proceeded to direct the members of the Task Force through the investigations of abuse to institutionalized citizens in the mental health facilities of Southeastern Michigan. It may be presumed that it was Cohen's direction which split the focus of the Task Force from the purely investigative to include research into the means of preventing future abuse. The Task Force reports are clear in their statements indicating that it is not enough for the State of Michigan to act as watchdog, there is also a need to ensure, through appropriate social programs, training, and compensation, the well-being of all Michigan residents.</p>
      <p>Cohen retired as dean in 1978, and in 1980 he moved to Austin, Texas to take the position of Sid W. Richardson Professor of Public Affairs at the Lyndon Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. During his career, Cohen wrote a number of books on the Social Security system and welfare policy. He served in a number of non-profit organizations, including forming and leading Save our Security, a coalition of groups opposed to the cuts in Social Security benefits proposed by President Jimmy Carter's administration. He maintained his interest in social policy and related issues up to his death on May 18, 1987 at the age of seventy three.</p>

          <p>The collection of papers from Wilbur J. Cohen's Task Force on the Prevention and Investigation of Abuse in State Institutions are comprised of correspondence, testimonies, drafts and reports, state departmental documents, legal briefs, and press clippings. The bulk of these documents serve to provide insight into the Task Force's investigatory processes. In addition, the inclusion of early material serves to illustrate the impetus for its formation, while later material documents its after-effect.</p>
          <p>The roughly chronological arrangement of the records provides a coherent history of the short-lived (March-July, 1978) Task Force. The first subseries, Pre-Task Force, contains material dating from 1977 through the early days of the Task Force. Included here are the Detroit Free Press articles concerning abuse at the Plymouth Center for Human Development. These articles set in motion the public demand for accountability in the abuse found at Plymouth. Governor Milliken's response is also found here, and his subsequent appointment of the Task Force. Other early documents are the two reports (Bishop and Davis), which offered preliminary information to the members of the Task Force.</p>
          <p>The second subseries contains material created or gathered by the Task Force. The series includes meeting minutes, a plethora of solicited information from sources both inside and outside the state, and documents regarding the two special panels created out of the Task Force (i.e., Special Oakdale Review Panel, and Special Panel on Care in Nursing Homes, Homes for the Aged, and Adult Foster Care Facilities). Particularly poignant are the nine folders of correspondence and testimonies, written by current and former institutionalized citizens and their family members. This series also contains the drafts and reports of the Task Force and its special panels, including responses to these documents.</p>
          <p>The Post-Task Force subseries contains several items postdating the Task Force's period of existence. Here are found "follow-up" documents from the Department of Mental Health and the Plymouth Center for Human Development, the draft of the "Hollister Bill", and the text of a presentation made by Wilbur J. Cohen before the Michigan Legislature. Also included is a copy of Gary Bass's PhD. dissertation (1979), for which Cohen was faculty advisor. Bass played an important role in the Task Force, particularly in his involvement with the Special Oakdale Review Panel; his dissertation contains loosely-veiled references to the findings of the Task Force.</p>
          <p>The Miscellaneous subseries contains an exhaustive and informative "scrapbook" of original and photocopied newspaper articles. These press clippings document events at the Oakdale Center for Developmental Disabilities, from March through June, 1978, much of which implies the effect of the Task Force's Special Panel. The two folders containing press clippings on the Plymouth Center for Human Development cover the period of February through December, 1978. These articles includes references to the staffing upheaval at Plymouth, from the director on down to the caregivers, which resulted from the investigations of the Task Force and its precursor, the Davis Panel. The series also contains 20 audiocassette tapes of Task Force meetings.</p>
