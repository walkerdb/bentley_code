      <p>James Edmund Scripps, Detroit newspaper publisher, was born March 19, 1835 in England, to James Mogg Scripps, a bookbinder, and his second wife, Ellen Mary (Sandus) Scripps. In 1844, the family came to the United States and settled on a farm near Rushville, Illinois. There James worked on the family farm and attended the district school.</p>
      <p>In 1857, Scripps left Rushville for Chicago. There he attended Digby V. Bell Commercial School and received his diploma in twelve weeks. Vowing to be successful in business, Scripps's first job was in a lumberyard for a salary of $400 a year. When this establishment failed in September 1857, Scripps secured a position as a reporter for the Democratic Press, published by his cousin, John Locke Scripps. Financial troubles at the paper resulted in employment cutbacks, and J.E. Scripps lost his position. He then worked temporarily directing Canadian sheep pelts to Chicago markets. In 1859, after a brief return to Rushville, Scripps became commercial editor of the Detroit Daily Advertiser. Two years later, Scripps became part owner of this paper, and, in 1862, when the Advertiser merged with the Detroit Tribune, he became business manager and later managing editor. In the same year, Scripps married Harriet Josephine Messinger.</p>
      <p>Throughout his first decade in the newspaper business, Scripps contemplated marketing a small, inexpensive, but well-written newspaper containing a minimum of advertising. On August 23, 1873, Scripps founded just such a paper, The Evening News. Although the paper originally lost money, it began to pay for itself after six months in operation. By 1875, all losses had been replenished and a profit of $6,000 was recorded. On August 23, 18T6, The Evening News was incorporated as the Evening News Association. James E. Scripps held the majority interest. Other incorporators included his brother George, his half-brother Edward Wyllis Scripps, his sister Ellen Browning Scripps and a cousin, John S. Sweeney.</p>
      <p>The Evening News continued to grow, and by 1877, the paper employed 640 persons. Five years later the paper reported a circulation figure exceeded only by ten other papers in the country. Foreign cable service, shared with the <title render="italic">New York Post</title>, the <title render="italic">Chicago News</title>, and a few other papers, began in <title render="italic">The Evening News</title> on May 5, 1885.</p>
      <p>The success of <title render="italic">The Evening News</title> encouraged James, George, and Edward to start newspapers in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Cincinnati. Those papers controlled by members of the Scripps family became known as the Scripps' League. In 1877, James E. Scripps made an agreement with his two brothers over control of the papers, and spent two years abroad for health reasons. After his return in 1889, growing disagreements over managerial, financial, and editorial concerns led James E. Scripps to withdraw <title render="italic">The Evening News.</title> By this time, George B. Booth, Scripps's son-in-law and eventual successor, had joined the staff of the Evening News Association.</p>
      <p>As the success of the Evening News Association continued, James E. Scripps considered reducing the price of <title render="italic">The Evening News</title> to one cent. To test the existence of a market for a paper of this price, Scripps created his own competition by starting the <title render="italic">Detroit Times</title>, which sold for one cent, in August 1890. The success of this paper revealed a hospitable market. Accordingly, Scripps lowered the price of <title render="italic">The Evening News</title> to one cent on October 1, 1892. The <title render="italic">Detroit Times</title> merged into <title render="italic">The Evening News</title> in the sane year.</p>
      <p>In October 1893, the <title render="italic">Sunday News</title> and <title render="italic">Sunday Tribune</title> were combined under the name the <title render="italic">Sunday News-Tribune</title>, later renamed the <title render="italic">Detroit News-Tribune</title>. At this point, the Evening News Association was printing <title render="italic">The Evening News</title>, the <title render="italic">Detroit Tribune</title>, and the <title render="italic">Sunday News-Tribune</title>.</p>
      <p>After the death of George H. Scripps in 1900, James E. Scripps and Edward W. Scripps struggled in bitter litigation for control of the Evening News Association. The issue was to determine the residence of George H. Scripps, who left a will, which named William A. Scripps and Edward W. Scripps as executors, and was admitted to probate in Cleveland. James E. Scripps claimed that Detroit had been the home of his brother George, and that, therefore, the will should have been offered for probate there. James also wished to have the will declared invalid in order to prevent the transfer of the shares of George H. Scripps in the Evening News Association to Edward Whyllis Scripps. If such a transfer occurred, Edward would have been the second largest stockholder and might have eventually gained a controlling interest. The result of this conflict was that James E. Scripps relinquished all ties with the Scripps' enterprises in exchange for complete control of the Evening News Association.</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, James E. Scripps established a thirty-year trust to ensure that control of the Evening News Association remained with his immediate family. Upon his death in 1906, the trust was administered by William E. Scripps, his son, and George G. Booth and Edgar B. Whitcomb, his sons-in-law.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>This collection contains both the personal papers of James E. Scripps and the records of the thirty-year trust he created shortly before his death in 1906. This collection is divided into four series: Biographical Materials, Business Records, George H. Scripps Probate Records, and James E. Scripps Trust Records. Although the bulk of this collection concerns the running of the Evening News Association, the most captivating items are those which pertain to the life of James E. Scripps. The records of the Evening News Association, the James E. Scripps Corporation, and the James E. Scripps Trust, with related litigation materials, attest to the complexity of this Detroit newspaper operation.</p>

          <p>Biographical Materials contains a lengthy biography, completed in 1943, by Cyril Arthur Player, which is an invaluable source of details on the life of James E. Scripps. Also in this series are two folders of autobiographical material, including notes made by Scripps as early as 1857 and 1861. Of interest are the annual diaries kept by Scripps from 1858 to 1881. These speak of travels in the United States and Europe, family, and the newspaper business. Two additional journals, recording travels to Europe in 1881 and 1889, are equally fascinating.</p>

          <p>The next series - George H. Scripps Probate Records - includes records of the probate settlement in Cuyahoga County in Ohio followed by testimony and related papers. Four scrapbooks containing newspaper articles documenting the progress of the litigation between James E. Scripps and Edward W. Scripps over the will of George B. Scripps and the future of the Evening News Association follow. These scrapbooks also contain articles on a trial occurring in March 1907, in which John S. Sweeney attempted to claim a controlling interest in the Evening News Association, based on an agreement concerning stock transfer signed twenty years earlier.</p>

            <p>The Tax Materials subseries relates to the trust. Aside from annual income tax reports from 1917 to 1940, the bulk of the papers here relate to litigation which occurred between 1925 and 1928. The issue disputed was whether the beneficiaries or the trustees should pay taxes on income, when the distribution of this income among the beneficiaries is discretionary with the Trustees. The records located here include correspondence, legal records, and materials documenting transactions following the litigation.</p>

            <p>In the "Clark Suit", resolved in 1928, the plaintiffs, Rex B. Clark and Grace S. Scripps, asked that stock of the Evening News Association be distributed among the children of James E. Scripps immediately. In defense, the Trustees held that such stock should not be distributed until the expiration of the trust in 1936. In a decision handed down in Circuit Court in June 1928, the validity of the trust was upheld. Included here are correspondence between the Clarks and the Trustees, testimony, court records and expense statements.</p>
