      <abstract>Irwin Small graduated from the University of Michigan in 1949 where he was a member of the national champion football teams in 1947 and 1948. Small went on to a career in dentistry specializing in oral and maxillofacial surgery. He developed a mandibular staple for use with fixed dental implants. The collection contains articles, slides, and videotapes related to the development and use of the mandibular staple bone plate, and material on the University of Michigan 1947 and 1948 football teams, particularly the 50th reunions.</abstract>

      <p>Irwin A. Small was raised in Tarrytown, New York where he was a star of the Washington Irving High School football team, 1941-1943. He enrolled in the University of Michigan in 1944 as a freshman and joined the football team as a "walk-on." Small completed one semester before joining the Air Force. He returned to Michigan in 1946 as a second semester freshman, but under the postwar rules freshmen were no longer eligible for varsity competition. Small was invited to join the 1947 squad and played quarterback and linebacker for the scout team that emulated the opposing teams plays during practice sessions. Though he did not see action during the regular season, Coach Fritz Crisler named Small to the traveling squad for the 1948 Rose Bowl game against the University of Southern California. Small played the role of quarterback in the T-formation offense that Southern California ran. Michigan won the Rose Bowl 49-0 and was named national champions in the final Associated Press poll.</p>
      <p>Small saw limited action in two games in the 1948 season. The 1948 team was undefeated and ranked number one by the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>Small received his B.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1949 and a D.D.S. from Columbia University in 1953. He completed his residency in oral and maxillofacial surgery at St. Louis University and Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital. He was in private practice in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan for 38 years. Small developed a compression staple or fixed mandibular implant for denture prosthesis and reconstructive surgery. His mandibular implant and the tools used with it were commercially distributed by Hall Reconstructive Systems.</p>
      <p>The 1947 Michigan football squad was an especially close-knit squad. The fact that many team members were World War II veterans and the experience of an undefeated season, Big Ten Championship, Rose Bowl victory, and national championship forged a special bond. The team held well attended reunions every five years and as the 50th anniversary approached, Kurt Kampe and other team members proposed holding the reunion in Pasadena. Kampe began planning and organizing the reunion, but became ill and died in 1995. Small assumed the role of principal organizer.</p>
      <p>Small prepared a program for the reunion that included a video of the game film of the 1948 Rose Bowl game, for which he provided a narration, and several other films featuring Coach Fritz Crisler and clips of early Michigan football. With the assistance of other team members he prepared a commemorative book.</p>
      <p>Small was also the main organizer of the 1948 team's 50-year reunion held in Ann Arbor. He provided a voice-over commentary for a videotape of the 1948 Indiana game, a 54-0 Michigan victory in which nearly every team member played. Small and several teammates produced a commemorative publication of the reunion.</p>

          <p>The Football Team Reunion series (.5 linear feet) documents the organizing of the 50 year reunions of the 1947 and 1948 University of Michigan football teams and the programs presented at the reunions. The papers consist of correspondence and miscellaneous papers, a questionnaire completed by the 1947 team, a small number of photographs, and a videotape and the commemorative book produced for each reunion.</p>
          <p>The correspondence, most of which relates to the 1947 team reunion, is divided into Kampe files, generated by Kurt Kampe, the original organizer of 50th reunion, and the files of Irwin Small who assumed leadership of the reunion after Kampe's death. The correspondence provides information about the preparations for the reunion and some interesting insights and information about the players' experiences at Michigan and their later careers.</p>
          <p>The videotape produced for the 1947 team reunion includes footage of the team's arriving in Pasadena, complete footage of the 1948 Rose Bowl game with some voice-over narration by Dr. Small, several highlight clips from the 1947 season and portions of a television program about Coach Fritz Crisler. The 1948 reunion video is of the 1948 Indiana game, a 54-0 Michigan victory in which nearly every team member played. Dr. Small provided a voice-over commentary for the video. These videos are stored with Athletic Department game tapes at the Bentley.</p>
          <p>The commemorative books include reproductions of articles, rosters and photographs from game programs and other sources, newspaper clippings, letters, play diagrams and other material from the Herbert O. Crisler and Bennie Oosterbaan papers and other sources at the Bentley Library, biographical material about team members and recollections written by some team members. Each of the books was autographed by all the team members attending the reunions.</p>

          <p>The Dentistry Career series pertains to research and development of the mandibular staple bone plate and its subsequent use, production and licensing. Publications include published journal articles related to the mandibular staple bone place procedure as well as unpublished articles and presentations about mandibular implants. Most of the published articles are written or co-written by Small. They are organized chronologically by date of publication. A collection of audio-visual material contains three folders of slides used for instructional lectures on the mandibular staple and nine videos on the procedure made between 1974 and 1993.</p>
