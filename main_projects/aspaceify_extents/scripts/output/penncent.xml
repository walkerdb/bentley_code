        <p>The Penn Central Transportation Company records (donor no. <num encodinganalog="541$e">7310</num>) include the records of hundreds of companies that were initially independent but were eventually absorbed by the New York Central Railroad Company or the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The records were acquired by the Bentley Library as part of the Penn Central Railroad Appraisal Project. This project was funded by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission and lasted from April 1, 1984 to October 15, 1986. The project's team of archivists appraised the records of Penn Central and distributed them to seven repositories: the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, the Hagley Museum and Library, the New York Public Library, the New Jersey State Archives, Temple University, Penn State University, and the Bentley Historical Library.</p>
        <p>The records of the Pennsylvania Railroad were divided among the seven repositories on a roughly geographical basis, with the Bentley Library receiving records of all companies that were subsidiaries of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, a subsystem of the Pennsylvania Railroad. About one-third of the Grand Rapids and Indiana subsidiaries' lines ran within the boundaries of Michigan.</p>
        <p>The New York Central Railroad records were distributed in a similar fashion, with the Bentley receiving records of the Michigan Central Railroad, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad, and their subsidiaries.</p>
        <p>The Bentley also received the records of the Ann Arbor Railroad, an independently-operated company in which the Pennsylvania Railroad held a majority interest, and the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad. The Ann Arbor Railroad was formed in 1895 through the reorganization of the Toledo, Ann Arbor, and North Michigan Railroad. The Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad was created in 1905 through a series of consolidations of Ohio and Michigan railroad lines. Henry Ford purchased the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton in 1920 and sold it in 1929 to Pennroad, a holding company that was owned principally by Pennsylvania Railroad stockholders. The Detroit, Toledo and Ironton continued to be operated separately, but its purchase by Pennroad assured that the Pennsylvania Railroad's interests would be protected.</p>

      <p>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company was formed in 1846 and expanded rapidly in the 1860s and 1870s, eventually controlling over 800 corporations. The New York Central Railroad Company was organized in 1853 and merged with the Hudson River Railroad in 1869 to form the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad; in 1914 the name was again changed to the New York Central Railroad Company.</p>
      <p>The Penn Central Transportation Company was formed in 1968 through the merger of the Pennsylvania and New York Central Railroads. The company did not prosper and went bankrupt in 1970. The company was reorganized in 1971 with the help of the Federal Government and the creation of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK) which assumed long distance passenger service and in 1976 with the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) which took over the viable parts of Penn Central and five other bankrupt rail lines. Penn Central was reorganized as the Penn Central Corporation in 1978; it liquidated most of its rail subsidiaries and property and became a general holding company with subsidiaries in energy, electronics, equipment, manufacture, and real estate.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The nature of the records of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad reflects the recent history of the two companies. When the Penn Central Transportation Company was formed in 1968, the offices of New York Central--the junior merger partner--were dismantled and only a small percentage of records retained. Therefore, the extant New York Central records consist almost entirely of minutes and account books of a routine nature. By contrast, records of the Pennsylvania Railroad were relatively undisturbed by the merger and are today richer and more varied than those of the New York Central. The Penn Central records are most useful for their documentation of the growth of the railroad industry. They depict an industry in constant flux due to the opportunities for success offered by a burgeoning industry and the intense competition among railroads that resulted. A single volume of records often contains minutes of two or more railroads, reflecting either the failure of the original company or its takeover by or merger with another company.</p>
      <p>Besides documenting the history of individual railroads and of the railroad industry as a whole, the Penn Central records are a good source on the economic and commercial development of Michigan and neighboring states, and provide insight into the rise and decline of various towns along the railroad. Minutes of New York Central subsidiaries, for example, contain discussions of negotiations with town officials over the proposed construction of tracks, bridges, depots, and the like. Similarly, the locality files in the Superintendent--Toledo Division series of the Pennsylvania Railroad records consist of correspondence and memoranda regarding improvements to, or the abandonment of, stations in small towns in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. This series also contains substantial correspondence files on Toledo, Detroit, and Grand Rapids.</p>
      <p>Labor and social historians will find the Penn Central records useful in illuminating the lives of workers and in documenting relations between management and workers. More than 40 feet of labor relations files of the Ann Arbor Railroad include agreements between the company and unions, grievances, petitions concerning work rules and pay, wage and hour schedules, and circular letters. There are small series of labor relations files of other companies scattered throughout the collection. Researchers will also find information on the workplace and working conditions in the locality files of the Superintendent--Toledo Division series of the Pennsylvania Railroad; these files contain, for example, memoranda concerning clubrooms and sleeping quarters for workers in city depots.</p>
      <p>There is very little technical material in the Penn Central records; photographs are likewise scarce. The most notable exceptions are in the car ferry files, found in three subseries of the Pennsylvania Railroad records: General Manager--Western Region, Vice-President and General Counsel, and Subsidiaries: Mackinac Transportation Company. The car ferry files include maps, plans, specifications, blueprints, and some photographs.</p>
      <p>A large portion of the collection consists of records of small railroads that ran through Michigan or were based in Michigan. Records of these companies are brief, often including nothing more than articles of incorporation, a few pages or a volume or two of minutes, and perhaps some annual reports and financial records. Although many of these railroads were subsidiaries of either the Michigan Central Railroad, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad, or the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, they have been filed under the parent company of which the sub-system was a part (New York Central, Pennsylvania, or Ann Arbor Railroad) to promote ease of access. Thus, for example, records of the Canada Southern Bridge Company, a subsidiary of Michigan Central Railroad, are filed under New York Central Railroad, the parent company of Michigan Central. Researchers uncertain of the parentage of a particular railroad should look in the subsidiaries section of the contents list under Ann Arbor, New York Central, and Pennsylvania Railroads. The railroads in each of these subsidiaries sections are arranged in alphabetical order.</p>
      <p>Brief histories of individual railroads can be found in the "Green Books"--the annual reports of the New York Central Railroad Company and its subsidiaries. There are several published histories of the Pennsylvania Railroad in boxes 183 and boxes 155-157 and on microfilm in box 60.</p>
      <p>A card file giving the date of incorporation, name changes, and parentage of subsidiaries of the Michigan Central Railroad, Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad, and the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad has been photocopied and can be found in box 1 of the collection. This folder also contains a list of records in the Public Archives of Canada of Grand Trunk and Great Western Railway system properties in the United States. Finally, there is a section of Aids, Gifts, Grants and Donations to Railroads Including Outline of Development and Successions in Titles to Railroads in Michigan by the Michigan Railroads Commission (1919).</p>
      <p>Information in this finding aid concerning the histories of the various railroads was drawn from the collection itself, from sources compiled by the project archivists, and from the following published sources: William Frederick Dunbar <title render="italic">All Aboard! A History of Railroads in Michigan</title> (Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1969) and Henry E. Riggs, <title render="italic">The Ann Arbor Railroad Fifty Years Ago</title> (Ann Arbor Railroad Company, 1947?)</p>

          <p>This subgroup is divided into administrative records, financial records, legal and other records, labor relations files, and records of subsidiaries. Administrative and financial records are arranged alphabetically by type of material, labor relations files by file number.</p>
          <p>Records of the parent company include annual reports for the years 1910 to 1963; minutes of meetings of the board of directors and executive committee, 1910 to 1960; financial records; reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission; legal records; and various other reports and studies. The bulk of the records--42 feet--consists of labor relations files dating primarily from the 1920s to 1960. These files contain contracts and agreements, complaints, and claims regarding wages, hours, rules, and regulations for various groups of railroad workers. A card file in box 57 indexes and summarizes circular letters sent out by the Bureau of Information of the Eastern Railways from the 1930s to the 1960s.</p>
          <p>In addition to the records of the Ann Arbor Railroad there are fragmentary records of five of its subsidiaries: the Ann Arbor Boat Company; Manistique and Lake Superior Railroad Company; Manistique, Marquette and Northern Railroad Company; Menominee and St. Paul Railway Company; and Wabash Radio Corporation. These records range from annual reports and minutes to labor relations files, balance sheets, and reports to the Michigan Board of Assessors.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The records of New York Central subsidiaries (boxes 60, 76-154) are arranged alphabetically by railroad name. The records vary in quantity and quality, but documentation of most of these railroads is meager at best. The amount of material for individual companies ranges from one item to fifteen feet. Often the only records we have for a particular railroad are articles of incorporation or merger and consolidation agreements. Most railroads, however, are represented by one or more of the following types of material: board of directors' minutes, annual reports, reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission, operating statements and other financial records, mortgages, stock registers, and correspondence, usually of the secretary or treasurer. Although minutes are for the most part routine, recording elections of officers and resolutions passed, with little or no commentary, occasionally one finds more valuable information. For example, minutes of the Michigan Air Line Railroad dating from the 1870s contain an interesting discussion of competition with the Michigan Central Railroad.</p>
            <p>The earliest records in this subgroup are minutes of the Buffalo and Mississippi Railroad, which run from 1836 to 1851. Among the railroads that are somewhat better documented than most are the Mahoning Coal Railroad Company, the Lake Erie and Pittsburgh Railway, and the Chicago River and Indiana Railroad Company. The Michigan Central Railroad (boxes 126-140) constitutes the largest group of records among the New York Central subsidiaries, measuring 15 feet and dating back from 1846 to 1960. Records of the Michigan Central Railroad, which was incorporated in 1846, include minutes (1846-1959), correspondence of the secretary and treasurer, financial and legal files, and some early correspondence of the Pension Department concerning employee relations.</p>
            <p>By contrast, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad (boxes 118-120), also a subsystem of the New York Central, is sparsely documented, containing only four feet of records, but including a 45-year run of board of directors' minutes (1869-1914). The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad was incorporated in 1869.</p>

          <p>This series is divided into nine subseries. Published histories of the Pennsylvania Railroad constitute the first subseries, Histories. The remaining subseries are arranged alphabetically.</p>
          <p>The second and third subseries are annual reports of the parent company, 1847-1966, and of the parent and its subsidiaries, 1905-1916, 1918-1935, and 1937. Bylaws and Organization consists of several sets of bylaws from the period 1893 to 1922.</p>
          <p>The General Manager - Western Region subseries (boxes 184-191) includes correspondence, agreements, specifications, plans, maps, photographs, and legal papers related to the Muskegon to Milwaukee car ferry. Also in this subseries are Locality Files of the Grand Rapids Division, consisting primarily of correspondence, memoranda, and agreements having to do with improvements or abandonment of equipment, facilities, and stations in Michigan and Indiana towns and cities.</p>
          <p>The Miscellaneous subseries (box 183; listed as part of description for box 191) contains timetables, a 1956 hiring manual, and a 1946 report, "The Growth of Highway Traffic in Michigan." The Superintendent--Toledo Division subseries (boxes 192-195) consists of locality files for Detroit, Toledo, and various Ohio towns and subject files containing studies, maps, diagrams, rules, instructions, and other material.</p>
          <p>The Vice-President and General Counsel subseries (boxes 195-197) is comprised of the legal department's car ferry files, which include some photographs, and miscellaneous files including reports, agreements, a court opinion, and a history of the Eastern Division of the Central Region, Pennsylvania Railroad.</p>
          <p>Pennsylvania Railroad Company: Subsidiaries (boxes 198-247) is the final subseries and contains minutes, ledgers, journals, annual reports, and, occasionally, correspondence of railroads in which the Pennsylvania held a majority interest. Of these, the richest files are those of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, incorporated in 1855, and the Mackinac Transportation Company. Records of the latter are concerned with the company's applications to the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon car ferry service; some photographs are included.</p>

            <p>Pennsylvania Railroad Company: Subsidiaries (boxes 198-247; 290) is the final subseries and contains minutes, ledgers, journals, annual reports, and, occasionally, correspondence of railroads in which the Pennsylvania held a majority interest. Of these, the richest files are those of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, incorporated in 1855, and the Mackinac Transportation Company. Records of the latter are concerned with the company's applications to the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon car ferry service; some photographs are included.</p>
