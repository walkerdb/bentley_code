    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>In 1871 the University of Michigan became the first university in the United States to drop the admissions requirement of entrance examinations and offer instead a program of voluntary accreditation to public, private, and parochial secondary schools. Michigan high schools that wanted to enter into this arrangement were visited by a university faculty committee that appraised the schools for their work in science, philosophy, and the arts. A school that passed the minimum criteria in all three areas would be accredited. By 1876 accreditation specifications had changed to accommodate schools that were strong in only one or two of the subject areas. Students from these schools would be granted entrance to select university programs depending on the accreditation status of the secondary school from which they graduated. During the early years of the program, requests for accreditation came from outside of the state, including schools in California, Massachusetts, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. In 1884 admission to the University of Michigan by diploma was extended to high schools outside of Michigan. By May of 1900, a single system of entrance requirements went into effect.</p>
      <p>Five Michigan high schools were accredited the first year, these being Adrian High School, Ann Arbor High School, Central High School of Detroit, Central High School of Flint, and Jackson High School. In 1900 there were 127 accredited schools. By 1951 this number had reached 635.</p>
      <p>In 1899, at the recommendation of the faculty of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, the Board of Regents agreed that an individual was needed to oversee the accreditation program on a full-time basis. Thus, Alan S. Whitney, who went on to become chair of the Department of Education and the first dean of the School of Education, was appointed the first full-time inspector of high schools. He was followed in 1914 by Dr. James B. Edmonson, who later became the second dean of the School of Education. In 1929 Dr. George E. Carrothers became director of what had come to be known as the Division of University Inspection of High Schools. In 1932 the unit was reorganized and renamed as the Bureau of Cooperation with Educational Institutions.</p>
      <p>In 1948 the Board of Regents authorized the establishment of the Bureau of School Services, effectively combining the activities of the Bureau of Educational Reference and Research, the Bureau of Cooperation with Educational Institutions, and other support units. The Bureau's administrative hierarchy consisted of a director, who reported directly to the Board of Regents, and a coordinating or executive committee consisting of deans, professors, and administrators appointed by the Board of Regents. Provost James P. Adams remarked that "The establishment of the Bureau of School Services will make possible the extension and development of the University's services to schools and the communities of the State." (Letter to Schools, vol. 1, no. 1, June 1948). The Bureau's function, as explained by the provost, was to coordinate within the university the activities previously carried out by a number of separate agencies. It was to extend the services already provided and develop new services to the schools as needed. Additionally, it would act as a central office of communication with the schools regarding the services of the university. Over the years, the services provided to both public and private high schools have included consulting services in a variety of areas such as testing and evaluation, libraries, area studies, journalism, and curriculum. The Bureau also sponsored and directed a number of conferences, including the annual Citizenship Conference; the Conference for School Board Members, School Officials, and Laymen; Cheerleaders' Clinics; Forensic Day; Secondary School Conference of the Schoolmasters Club; and a number of area conferences and smaller meetings between school administrators and university representatives.</p>
      <p>In 1970 oversight of the Bureau of School Services was moved to the School of Education. The director reported to the assistant dean of Services and Institutional Relations. The executive committee was replaced by a University Advisory Committee, which was chaired by the dean of the School of Education and composed of the Administrative Dean of the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the deans of the College of Engineering, the School of Music, and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.</p>
      <p>The accreditation program provided minimum standards for secondary schools to seek to attain and surpass. Accreditation visits took place once every five to seven years by a university appointed accreditation consultant, meaning that each year approximately one-fifth of the accredited high schools were visited in any given year. During the visit teachers and programs were evaluated. These evaluations were combined with a report that was submitted by the school to determine accreditation status. In addition to its accreditation function, the Bureau also served as a liaison between the Michigan State Department of Education and the various school districts.</p>
      <p>In 1983 a review committee evaluating the School of Education recommended closure of the Bureau. At this point the Bureau continued, but was pushed to become a self-supporting entity. In 1984, following a reorganization of the School of Education, the Bureau became part of the Bureau of School Improvement and Standards, which was subsequently reorganized as the Bureau of Accreditation and School Improvement Studies. The Bureau of School Services finally closed in 1992 when the Michigan State Department of Education took over accreditation activity.</p>
      <p>The North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools was a somewhat separate accreditation agency that maintained close ties with the university's accreditation program. The Association began in 1895 and maintained its main office at the University of Michigan. Some of its files were transferred with those of the Bureau of School Services and are inter-filed within the Bureau's accreditation inspection reports. The North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools still maintains a regional program on campus at the University of Michigan.</p>

          <p>The Accreditation Inspection Reports (1871-1992), of which there are 163 linear feet, make up the bulk of the collection. These records include inspection reports, done by the Bureau and its predecessors, as well as reports submitted to the university's accreditation program by the individual schools. The files vary in size and content, but include information such as the following: student demographics, teacher education, curriculum, support facilities, class schedules, correspondence, population of city, enrollment, number of teachers, number of recitations, graduates attending higher education, employment practices, library facilities, laboratory facilities, school income, counseling standards, health programs, policies and objectives, guidance programs, administrator qualifications, and financial data. Some accreditation files of the North Central Association are also included.</p>
          <p>The earliest accreditation inspection reports are located in two bound volumes at the beginning of the collection. These were part of the 1953 accession and span the dates 1892 to 1907, although reports of the North Central Association for 1905 are included with the unbound reports. Reports are in rough alphabetical order by city and primarily include information about the instructors, number of students, size of library, and other brief comments about the school. They are not filed alphabetically with the rest of the reports as they were not easily separable. The bound volumes also include early reports for schools outside of Michigan. Additionally, there is one folder of unbound accreditation reports done in 1905 for non-Michigan schools. See the folder listing for the names of the schools included in the 1905 reports. The remainder of the accreditation inspection reports are filed alphabetically by city and then alphabetically by school name. An attempt was made to list varying names that the school used during its history and to cross reference schools to other cities and/or schools as appropriate. There were a number of loose reports that were part of the 1953 accession that have been interfiled with the 1996 accession as a matter of convenience to the researcher. These were largely reports of the North Central Association.</p>
          <p>Notes found within the collection indicate that university reports were not requested during the 1939/40 school year and that reports on school visits for the years 1879 to 1904 are available in the University of Michigan Registrar record group (box 11).</p>
          <p>References to these school visits and reports can be found scattered throughout a variety of other University of Michigan record groups. There are also letters within the papers of university president James B. Angell pertaining to school visits. One should consult the volumes of calendars of Angell's letters for examples.</p>

          <p>The Detroit High School Study Commission series (1966-1968) is comprised of three linear feet of records pertaining to a study of Detroit high schools during the years 1966 to 1968. The student boycott at Northern High School in April of 1966 was the main event evidencing the need for some type of evaluative study leading to change within the high schools of Detroit. The Commission, charged by Detroit Board of Education president Remus Robinson, was to gather thorough, comprehensive, and comparable data for each high school. This data would then be reviewed by the commission, with the expected outcome of establishing recommendations for improvement that would be presented both to the public and the Board of Education. Over 350 citizens were involved in the study, either as members of a high school study committee or as members of the Commission (made up of twenty-six members appointed by the Board of Education, as well as the chairman of each of the high school study committees). Individual school reports were presented to the city-wide Commission, which then brought together the findings and recommendations to be presented to the Board of Education and the public. The final report of the commission is located in box 165.</p>
          <p>The files of the Detroit High School Study Commission include one linear foot of correspondence, inventories of facility needs, guidelines and objectives of the study commission, minutes of Commission meetings, socio-economic rankings, and questionnaires. In addition, there are two linear feet of reports, including miscellaneous reports and statistics (for example, citizens advisory reports and interim reports given by various study committees), individual school reports, and the final reports of the high school study committees that were compiled, bound, and presented to the Detroit Board of Education.</p>
