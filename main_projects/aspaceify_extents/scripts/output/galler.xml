    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Bernard A. Galler received a B.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.B. in Liberal Arts from the University of Chicago in 1946 and 1947. He earned a M.A. in Mathematics from the University of California in 1949 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1955. He joined the University of Michigan Department of Mathematics in 1955 as an instructor; he was promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate professor in 1962, and professor in 1966.</p>
      <p>Galler was a pioneer in the field of computer science, helping to shape this discipline at the University of Michigan. In the early 1960s, he was active in the development of the new Communications Sciences Program, and in 1966, he became associate director of the Computing Center. His association with the center continued through 1991. He became a charter member of the new Department of Computer and Communication Sciences in 1966 and served as its chair from 1973 to 1975. In 1984, Galler was instrumental in negotiating the merger of the CCS department and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
      <p>Galler also contributed to the University of Michigan's many innovations in the computer field. From 1958 onward, the Computing Center of the University of Michigan was a leader in the development of general-purpose, highly-productive operating systems. In the mid-1950s MIDSAC and MIDAC computers built at the Willow Run Laboratory were among the first computers built and used at universities in the U.S. The MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder) translator, created around 1960 and used by the entire campus for a number of years, contained innovative language features which were introduced much later into popular, high-level languages.</p>
      <p>Galler also served the wider university community as Associate Dean for Long Range Planning in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts from 1975 to 1979. He served on many university-wide committees and task forces and, in addition, served as undergraduate counselor for the computer science degree program for many years. Very active professionally, Galler was president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) from 1968 to 1970 and was active in the American Federation of Information Processing Societies (AFIPS). He received the AFIPS and ACM Distinguished Services Awards. In 1994, Galler retired from active faculty status after 38 years of service.</p>

      <p>The papers of Bernard A. Galler measure 28.87 linear feet and date from 1956 to 1994. The bulk of the papers document the years 1960 to 1986 and concern Galler's high level of involvement in the information processing profession at the University of Michigan, nationally, and internationally. The papers are arranged in five series: Biographical, Chronological Correspondence, Professional and Other Activities, University of Michigan and Audiotapes.</p>
      <p>The materials acquired in 2006 (boxes 28-29) were from Galler's office located in the Center for Information Technology Integration (CITI). These materials (1.5 linear foot, 1957-1996) focus mainly on the Software Patent Institute. There were a few files from early years acquired with this accession and they are described as part of the previously established series Chronological Correspondence, Professional and Other Activities and University of Michigan. The exception was the addition of an Audiotape series that contains reel-to-reel tapes of lectures Alan J. Perlis gave in 1959.</p>

          <p>The Chronological Correspondence series dates from 1959 to 1993, although the bulk of it dates from 1961 to 1987. Measuring five feet, the correspondence reflects Galler's wide range of interests and activities in the information processing profession. Galler corresponded with those in industry and computer scientists at other universities both at a national and international level. Industry correspondents included those at Burroughs and Xerox. Galler's opinion was frequently sought on new products in the industry and for suggestions regarding candidates for positions and awards in academia and industry. His high level of professional involvement is also reflected in this series. Galler served on several external review committees for other universities in the 1970s and 1980s. The correspondence and reports surrounding these reviews offer the researcher glimpses of the status of computer science programs at other universities within the United States. Some of the institutions for which Galler served as a member of an external review committee include: The University of California at Berkeley in 1975, Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1977, the University of New Mexico in 1982, and the University of Pittsburgh in 1986. The series also includes correspondence with students, in some cases long after they left University of Michigan. University of Michigan correspondence is included in this series as well. Correspondents include Robert Kohrflage, Bruce Arden, Anthony Ralston, Philip Dorn, Bob Rosin, and Alan Perlis.</p>

          <p>The series Professional and Other Activities is the largest in the collection, measuring 13.5 linear feet, and is divided into several subseries: Board Activities, Consulting, Projects, and Other Activities. This series reflects most clearly the high level of creative participation that Galler had in his profession.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The subseries, Board Activities, 1959 to 1993 (1.75 ft.), documents Galler's involvement either as a member of the board of directors or the advisory board of several companies. The longest periods of involvement are reflected in Data Use and Access Laboratories (DUALabs) and National CSS. Documentation of Galler's involvement with DUALabs dates from 1970 to 1985. DUALabs had a nonprofit mission of providing research, training and database development service for users of publicly available statistics, especially census data. Galler's primary correspondent was John C. Beresford, president. Galler was an active promoter of the company and corresponded with Beresford regarding the company's operations. In addition to correspondence, the DUALabs material includes financial information and board minutes. Beresford resigned from DUALabs in 1982 to establish a for-profit company, DUAL-Comm. Galler was a member of the Board of Directors of National CSS, an information services company, from 1975 to 1979. The records include correspondence, press releases, and board minutes.</p>

            <p>The subseries titled Other Professional Activities, is the largest within the Professional Activities series and best documents Galler's wide ranging involvement in the profession. One of these profession affiliations was with the American Federation of Information Processing Societies. Galler was heavily involved in the efforts of AFIPS to establish an historical center to enable the profession to document itself. Galler's involvement with the Association for Computing Machinery, particularly his work on the Turing Award Committee underlines the extent of his professional network and his grasp of the profession in terms of contributions made.</p>
            <p>Also included with this subseries is Galler's contributions to the creation of the Corporation for Research and Educational Networking (CREN). Created when the Because It's Time Network (BITNET) and the Computer Science Network (CSNET) merged in October 1989, the mission of CREN was to provide low-cost connection services, and to foster new network technology and applications in support of low-cost connections, for education and research in both the academic and industrial communities. CSNET was a project of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research under contract to the National Science Foundation; it provided network communications services to organizations engaged in computer-related research, education, and advanced development. Most of its members were in computer science departments and in industry. BITNET served higher education and research facilities. The successful merger of the two was complex, technically and organizationally, and testifies to Galler's leadership and organizational skills.</p>
            <p>Galler served on the Science Council for Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, which was the scientific board of directors for the Institute for Computer Applications in Science and Engineering (ICASE) and the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS). Funded by NASA, through the University Space Research Association, ICASE was established in 1982. It was chartered to carry out state-of-the-art research in computer science and engineering in areas of potential long-term application to NASA programs. Galler also chaired the planning committee for the Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Science.</p>
            <p>As a member of the Science Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1968, Galler participated in explorations of a software institute. The effort is noteworthy because it represents an early attempt to cooperate internationally on the development of software.</p>

          <p>Within the University of Michigan series, Galler's research activities and his participation in university affairs and governance are documented. Of note are the folders on the Computer Aided Engineering Network (CAEN) within the College of Engineering. Started in 1982, CAEN responded to a need for expanded computing power for students and faculty through university-owned machines and unlimited access for students and faculty. These folders include memoranda among the CAEN executive committee, Executive Committee agendas, and other papers. The researcher should also consult the records of the College of Engineering for more information on this subject.</p>
