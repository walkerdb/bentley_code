      <p>The office now designated the Vice President for Development has undergone a number of changes in title and responsibilities since its inception. While today it is a fundraising unit, the office from which this unit evolved was established as a vehicle for communicating information about the university to those outside.</p>
      <p>As early as 1897 the regents of the University of Michigan recognized the need for a means through which official information about the university could be issued. Rather than establish a separate organization, the regents chose to graft this responsibility onto existing university units, offering a small sum of money to these units to cover additional expenses. Between 1897 and 1942 the department of rhetoric (1897-1901, 1912-1928), the Alumni Association (1901-1912), and the Bureau of Alumni Relations carried out this task. The work of the Bureau of Alumni Relations fell under the broad mandate of James B. Bruce, who in 1931 became the first university officer to bear the title Vice President in charge of University Relations. Bruce, a doctor by training, was an influential member of the Medical School faculty and held several important positions simultaneously. Bruce's general mandate was to oversee all university contacts with the non-academic world, most importantly by monitoring the intellectual content of post-graduate courses and presentations. Bruce personally seems to have had little interest in public relations.</p>
      <p>At the time of Bruce's retirement in 1942 the regents decided that the responsibility for disseminating information from the university should be placed in a distinct unit, reporting to the university's central administration. As a result, the University News Service was founded. In 1944, when Marvin L. Niehuss assumed Bruce's title, he also assumed indirect responsibility for the two-year-old News Service. Niehuss, however, shared Bruce's lack of interest in public relations. A member of the Law School faculty, he was asked by the president to concentrate upon the relationship between the university and the state legislature.</p>
      <p>Recognizing the need for a person with skills in public relations, the regents in 1945 agreed in principle to hire a full-time senior administrator to handle the university's relations with the public. In 1946 Arthur L. Brandon was hired to fill this position and was given the title Director of Information Services. Brandon's graduate training had been in the field of public relations and he had worked at various universities, including Vanderbilt and the University of Texas, in positions similar to this one. Brandon undertook an ambitious program to reach the various publics the university serves. He established, or re-established, several publications and offered public relations expertise to the entire campus community. He was also interested in the electronic media. Under Brandon the university began to broadcast over two wholly-owned radio stations, superseding the former practice of irregularly broadcasting programs over commercial radio stations. In 1950 Brandon began to experiment with educational television. He aggressively promoted Michigan productions and by the middle of the decade the university had more program outlets than any other educational institution.</p>
      <p>Brandon was also an innovator in fundraising. After World War II the university initiated the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project. Intended as a memorial to former University of Michigan students who had died in World War II, the campaign raised money to support research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Unlike similar efforts in the past, however, after the immediate goals of the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project were achieved, the staff responsible for fundraising was not dismissed. Instead, in 1951 the staff was placed under Brandon's purview. In 1953 ongoing fundraising was given a formal organization through the Development Council. The University of Michigan was the first public institution to establish a permanent fundraising unit.</p>
      <p>In 1951, as part of a general reorganization of the university, Brandon was given a new title, Director of University Relations, and reported directly to the president. Brandon held this title for six years, resigning it in 1957 to accept a vice presidency at New York University. Lyle M. Nelson, a professor of journalism, replaced Brandon. Nelson had served previously as an assistant to President Harlan Hatcher (1953-55) before leaving Ann Arbor to go to San Francisco State College. After his return to the University of Michigan, Nelson continued the policies of his predecessor in the areas of public relations and fundraising. The growing responsibilities of the office led to the designation of Nelson as Vice President for University Relations in 1960. The Presidents Club, a widely-imitated fundraising mechanism, was founded in 1961 during Nelson's tenure; designed to attract large private gifts to the university, the club required a contribution of $10,000 for membership.</p>
      <p>Nelson was succeeded in 1961 by Michael Radock. Formerly a professor of journalism at Kent State University, Radock came to the University of Michigan from Ford Motor Company, where he had been a member of the corporate public relations staff and manager of education affairs. Radock continued the substantive public information programs of his predecessors and also continued their tradition of innovative fundraising approaches.</p>
      <p>In 1964 Michael Radock oversaw the $55 Million Campaign, which broke new ground for public institutions. Traditionally institutions had sought private funds for a specific project. In the late 1950s, however, Harvard revolutionized fundraising techniques by holding the first modern capital campaign. Rather than seeking support for a single project, Harvard asked its alumni and friends to support the general good of the institution, listing as the campaign's goals a group of needed capital improvements as well as support for endowment funds. Michigan was the first public institution to adopt a similar fundraising approach. In the course of this campaign the staff of the Development Office, which until then had worked almost exclusively with the Development Council, came more directly under the jurisdiction of the vice president.</p>
      <p>In the late 1970s Radock launched another major fundraising initiative through the authorization of a systematic and comprehensive census of alumni. The project's goal was to locate all living university alumni, making possible regular contact with them which would, it was hoped, lead to an increased percentage of alumni making annual contributions to the university.</p>
      <p>Between 1961 and 1981, when Radock retired, he exercised his authority under a series of titles. When first hired he was designated Director of University Relations. In 1964 he was given his predecessor's title, Vice President for University Relations. In 1969 he was named Vice President for University Relations and Development.</p>
      <p>When Jon Cosovich assumed the office in 1983 his title was Vice President for Development and University Relations. This was changed in 1985 to Vice President for Development and Communication. The shift away from communication toward fundraising was complete in 1988, when responsibility for communication with the larger community was transferred to the newly-created Office of University Relations and Cosovich's title became simply Vice President for Development.</p>

      <p>The records of the Vice President for Development date from 1948 to the present and measure 39.5 linear feet. They reflect the basic concerns of the office for these four decades: preserving and improving the university's public image and planning major fundraising efforts. Unfortunately, both activities are incompletely documented. In the area of public relations the records tend to discuss how immediate problems will be dealt with, rather than overall conceptions of the university's image. The thought behind the innovative fundraising devices created or employed by the office is sometimes recorded through consultant reports, but in general is not well documented.</p>
      <p>The manuscript records have been divided into two subgroups, one representing the records of the vice president (or senior staff person, for those years in which there was no vice presidency), the other containing records created by the development office. The Vice Presidents subgroup has been divided by the name of each person who has held the office: Arthur Brandon, Lyle Nelson, and Michael Radock. Researchers should note that since Nelson and Radock used their predecessor's files for some time before inaugurating their own records, the relationship between office tenure and file dates is not an exact one. The Development Office subgroup contains records of that office and its subsidiary units. Several accessions of Development Office records received in 1989 and 1990 have been grouped together as Development Office subgroup: 1989-1990 accessions.</p>

            <p>The Lyle Nelson/Michael Radock series contains records created between 1959 and 1964. It is identical in structure to the Brandon/Nelson series and is most notable for its information about the trip to the Soviet Union made by Harlan Hatcher in 1959. Nelson accompanied Hatcher to Russia and retained a great deal of information about the visit.</p>

            <p>The Michael Radock series (1960-1983) is the most complex in arrangement. The Radock series has three chronological divisions: 1960-1964 (primarily 1962-1963), 1963-1980 (primarily 1964-1976), and 1973-1983 (primarily 1977-1981). The first two divisions are arranged alphabetically by topic, as were the previous files. The first, 1960-1964, is very small, and is of interest primarily for information on the Sigma Nu controversy. Sigma Nu was a local fraternity that came under fire in Ann Arbor because of a provision in the organization's national charter banning Blacks from membership.</p>
            <p>The second, 1963-1980, is of interest in terms of the $55 Million Campaign (the last heading in the series), the Black Action Movement (BAM) and the BAM strike, and radio stations WUOM and WCBN. There is also incomplete information about protests regarding the appearance of George Lincoln Rockwell, leader of the American Nazi Party, at the University of Michigan in 1964. Beyond the campus, Radock was an active participant in professional organizations, particularly the American College Public Relations Association (ACPRA), of which he was president. This series contains extensive information about ACPRA and about its merger with the American Alumni Council, which resulted in the formation of the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE).</p>

          <p>The Development Office subgroup, dating from 1948 to 1984 and measuring 11 linear feet, consists of four series: Foundation Relations, a Topical File, and Photographs and Staff Files. Records within the series are arranged alphabetically by subject.</p>

            <p>The Foundation Relations Office records consist of chronological correspondence files for the period 1976 to 1980; committee, conference, and project files from 1973 to 1983; and schools and colleges files. The schools and colleges files contain information on various university units' fundraising and grant seeking attempts, and their dealings with the Foundation Relations Office. These files reflect the growing concern for centralized coordination of university-wide development campaigns and the difficulties encountered by the Foundation Relations Office in maintaining control over individual units' campaigns.</p>

            <p>The records in the Development Office Topical File, divided into Historical Files and an Alphabetical Subject File, reflect the curious history of this unit. The Development Office was originated and funded by the Development Council, a group of volunteer alumni organized to raise funds to support the university. Only after the initiation of the $55 Million Campaign in 1964 did this office become clearly associated with the vice president, developing into a central clearing office for all university fundraising projects.</p>

              <p>Slides (6 linear feet) consists of slides taken by News and Information Service photographers from the 1950s to the 1980s. The bulk of the slides, however, date from the 1960s and 1970s. Most of the slides document campus life and the physical plant of the University of Michigan. In addition, there is a small group of slides documenting the Dearborn and Flint campuses of the University and the city of Ann Arbor. Persons represented in "Individuals" include University of Michigan faculty, staff, and administrators, as well as visitors to the campus; slides of Development Office staff members can be found in this category.</p>

              <p>The Annual Giving Program series (2.5 linear feet), dating from 1970 to 1989, likewise contains samples of mail solicitations (see "Direct Mail"), as well as meeting materials and proposals for various fundraising programs. For information on the evolution and overall functioning of the Development Office in the 1980s, and in particular the annual giving program, researchers should see the folders "Background material for new staff" and "Overview of fundraising at the University of Michigan" as well as the Implementation Committee meetings and report.</p>

              <p>The Topical File (1.75 linear feet), dating from 1970 to 1984, 1989, and 1991/92 consists of miscellaneous files documenting the activities of the Development Office, arranged alphabetically. Of special note are the development handbook in box 32, which provides a description of the University's development program in the early 1970s, and the Development Education Program orientation notebook, which provides a similar overview of the development program in the year 1991/92. To assist the researcher in understanding the complex and ever-shifting structure of the Development Office, a complete set of organization charts for the years 1971 to 1990 has been placed in the Topical File.</p>

            <p>The Debra Griffth Staff Files series contains records created between 19892002. When Griffith began her position as Regional Director of the Major and Planned Gifts Office in the late 1990's, she requested that each academic unit send her their latest fundraising and recruiting information. These files offer a glimpse of the recruitment efforts and of the fundraising goals and initiatives of the different departments of the university between 1989-2002. The varied promotional materials display the unique look and feel of the many departments within the university. It is interesting to note the different strategies that each department employs to attract potential students, especially such news schools at the time as the School of Information. Within this collection there is also fundraising information pertaining to smaller university organizations such as the Center for the Education of Women, Department of Otolaryngology, Institute of Human Adjustment. There is also information relating to the fundraising efforts of Nichols Arboretum and the University of Michigan's Art Museum. The files are arranged alphabetically according to unit title.</p>

            <p>The Development Education Program series contains records created between 1985-2004. It has a wide range of materials relating to the training of university fundraising volunteers and donor relations. The majority of the material within this series falls into three sub-series: Committee Materials, Manuals, and Topical. Within the Committee Materials is documentation relating to the Development Office's Advisory Committee, Matching Gift Advisory Committee and Staff Development Advisory Committee. The larger sub-series contains fundraising manuals that focus on introducing fundraising staff and volunteers to the activities and responsibilities of the development office. They cover such subjects as matching gifts, planned giving, and the development offices' database system named RAMIS. These manuals provide a step by step guide to how the development office trained their staff and what expectations and responsibilities they placed upon them. The topical sub-series contains documents that discuss the history of philanthropy at the university and the university's broad fundraising goals between 1986-2004. There are proposals for university-wide Fundraising initiatives, information on the university's endowment, annual giving, and major gifts. Where the Debra Griffith staff files series focus on the fundraising goals of the separate university departments, the materials in the topical series render a representation of the university's broad fundraising, goals.</p>

            <p>The Audio-Visual Materials series includes audio cassette tapes, and BETA, U-Matic, and VHS videotapes. The cassette tapes contain recordings of several speeches given by former President Ford at the university. The BETA, U-Matic, and VHS videotapes are comprised of two main types, recruitment videos and documentation of the Michigan Fundraising Campaign that officially started in 1992. The recruitment videos offer picturesque views of central campus from the mid-1980's to the early 1990's. The Michigan Fundraising Campaign videos document the many presidential advisory meetings that were held by President Duderstat in 1990 when he, and the advisory board members, addressed such concerns as how the university will adjust to the modem technical environment and how they should adjust the mission and fundraising goals of the university. These concerns were focused before the official 1992 kick off of the large fundraising campaign titled "Campaign for Michigan". The videotapes are noteworthy because they clearly show that this campaign marked a new direction for the university, and that the school as a whole was redefining itself There are discussions that focus on adjusting the managing of the school to resemble the management of a business, and how this change will effect the mission, goals, and responsibilities of the university.</p>
