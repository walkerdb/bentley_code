      <p>In 1971, two of Detroit's most historically significant and influential Episcopal churches merged to form St. Matthew's and St. Joseph's Episcopal Church.</p>
      <p>St. Matthew's, the older of the two congregations, claims the distinction of being the third oldest Black church in the state of Michigan. Established in 1846 by the Reverend William C. Monroe, William Lambert, and other former members of Second Baptist Church, St. Matthew's Mission (as it was then called) played an active role in the education and spiritual support of the Black community of Detroit. The church, along with Second Baptist, was prominent as one of the stations on the underground railroad that shepherded fleeing slaves northward, out of the South and, from Detroit, across the border into Canada.</p>
      <p>During its first decade, the membership of St. Matthew's was small and subject to sudden fluctuation, particularly as its members felt threatened by provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law that could have returned them into bondage. Monroe, more than anyone else, maintained St. Matthew's as a viable church body, and when he resigned as vicar in 1859 to depart for Liberia as a missionary, St. Matthew's Mission experienced further decline. In 1864, the mission liquidated its assets. Some of the faithful continued to meet at Christ Church as the Sunday School of St. Matthew's, but in reality, from 1864 to 1880, the mission had ceased to exist.</p>
      <p>In 1880, the mission was revived, formal ties being established with the Michigan Diocese of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Services were first held in a rented hall. Then in 1881 the mission was moved to the site it would occupy for the next ninety years at the corner of St. Antoine and Elizabeth. In 1882, J. Mott Williams became the first regular pastor of the reorganized congregation.</p>
      <p>Throughout the nineteenth century, St. Matthew's, within the hierarchy of the Episcopal Church, was an organized mission. Then in 1907, following formal application and consideration by the Convention of the Diocese of Michigan, St. Matthew's obtained parish status, administratively responsible to the diocese and now governed by a vestry board chosen by its members.</p>
      <p>Although beset by continual financial worries, St. Matthew's grew in membership and importance to the community. After World War II, however, the church began experiencing the effects of shifts in the city's population. In addition to the movement of some of its members from the city to the suburbs, urban renewal was a further source of community disruption. To survive, church leaders realized that they would have to revitalize their ministry, and perhaps most importantly, find new facilities. By the late 1960s, under the leadership of St. Matthew's rector, the Reverend Quintin E. Primo, Jr., negotiations were opened with St. Joseph's, another similarly struggling parish, to discuss the possibility of a merger.</p>
      <p>The origins of St. Joseph's Episcopal Church can be traced to a commemorative chapel which Mrs. Lucetta Medbury gifted to the Episcopal Church in 1883. At first used only as a Sunday school, the members of St. Joseph's Memorial Chapel soon began considering whether to formalize its relationship to the Episcopal Church. Following consultations with the bishop, who gave them directives on the required number of members and the amount of pledge money needed, the members of St. Joseph's Memorial Chapel, on October 25, 1884, came together to form a new church to be called St. Joseph's Memorial Mission. The Reverend William J. Speiers was the Mission's first rector, followed by E. Breddon Hamilton and Louis Arthur.</p>
      <p>In the 1890s, most of the members of St. Joseph's merged into St. Paul's which Bishop Charles Williams had designated as his cathedral. In 1906, some of the church's former members decided to re-establish St. Joseph's at a different location, in the rapidly-growing area along Woodward Avenue, north of Grand Boulevard. This parish grew, and in 1926, moved into its new facility on Woodward Avenue between Holbrook and King Streets.</p>
      <p>The church in the coming decades acquired a reputation of being open to the needs of the people of the neighborhood. As the parish changed, the rectors of the church struggled to integrate their membership - and with success. In the 1960s, in the midst of the Vietnam War, St. Joseph's supported the principle that their church could be a sanctuary to young men who opposed the war as morally reprehensible. About this same time, moved by the requests of homosexual Christians for a place to worship, St. Joseph's opened its doors.</p>
      <p>There were costs to each of the liberal stands the church chose to make - costs in terms of time, money, and membership. In 1970, when the then rector Robert Morrison resigned, the vestry of St. Joseph's began considering a merger with St. Matthew's, and invited their rector, Quintin E. Primo, Jr., to serve as priest-in-charge of St. Joseph's.</p>
      <p>The merger was completed in 1971, with the St. Matthew's congregation moving over to St. Joseph's church facility. Primo served as rector of the merged congregation from 1971 to 1972, when he became Bishop of Chicago. He was replaced by the Reverend Orris G. Walker, Jr.</p>

          <p>The records of St. Matthew's (before 1971) total three linear feet and date primarily from the mid-1920s. Although providing excellent documentation for the years since about 1927, the St. Matthew's series, except for an occasional program or brochure, does not include materials for the first eighty years of the church's existence. Happily, the collection contains published histories and commemorative programs, which help to fill in these missing years.</p>
          <p>The St. Matthew's series has been divided into six subseries: Informational Files, Church Government, Pastors, Church Organizations, Publications, and Scrapbooks.</p>

            <p>Within "Publications" the researcher will find scattered copies of the church's various newsletters, the earliest dated 1914. Unfortunately, no chronological run of these newsletters seems to have been kept. The same is true of the church's Sunday bulletins. Though some date back to 1945, the bulk of them is for the year 1967.</p>

            <p>Some of the earliest dated documents in this series are found in the subseries, "Scrapbooks." Although the contents of the scrapbooks are partially duplicated in other subseries, what makes these scrapbooks especially valuable is the presence of early photographs of church groups and historically informative clippings and programs. The scrapbooks appear to have been created in the 1960s and 1970s, perhaps by the church historian. Unfortunately, the documents were put into the volumes in a random order. Thus, the researcher will have to examine all of the books for information on any given time period.</p>

          <p>The records of St. Joseph's total four and one-half linear ft. and date from 1884 to 1970 when the two churches merged. Subseries include: Informational Files, Church Government, Publications, Topical Files, Church Organizations, Register of Church Services, and Architectural Blueprints and Drawings. Though there are similarities between the subseries in the two series, there are also important differences. First, the records of St. Joseph's are more fulsome and complete than those of St. Matthew's; second, the St. Joseph's series includes files that reflect the church's involvement with community problems and social issues; and third, the St. Joseph's series includes types of documentation that is not available in the St. Matthew's series, notably information about the church building.</p>

          <p>The third series, St. Matthew's and St. Joseph's Episcopal Church, contains the records of the churches merged together. This series dates from 1970 to 1997, and measures approximately four and one-half linear feet.</p>
          <p>Subseries include: Informational Files, Church Government, Topical Files, and Publications. The contents of these subseries are similar to those of St. Joseph's and St. Matthew's previously described. Here again, the researcher will find the run of vestry minutes found in the subseries "Church Government" to be most informative about the activities of the church in the 1970s and 1980s. Also of value is an extensive run of the church's Sunday bulletins since the 1971 merger.</p>

          <p>The series, Photographs, consists of approximately .3 linear feet of photographs. In addition to photographs that document the personalities and activities of the two churches, this series also has photographs of the two church buildings, both interiors and exteriors. As noted before, for photographs about St. Matthew's, the researcher should also consult the scrapbooks found in box 3.</p>
