    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Jay Lash Cassidy, a student from Rockville, Maryland, enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1967 and graduated in 1970. At the University of Michigan he was active as a photographer for the campus yearbook <title render="italic">Michiganensian</title> and the student newspaper <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title>. Cassidy was the <title render="italic">Daily</title> photo editor during the winter 1970 semester. His photography during this period captured subjects as diverse as the 1968 presidential campaign, a 1967 homecoming concert featuring the Doors, and scenes of anti-Vietnam War demonstrations in Ann Arbor. Cassidy also took photos off campus. His off campus photography covered events such as the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the 1969 March on Washington, Richard Nixon's inauguration, and the 1968 campaigns of Robert F. Kennedy and George Wallace for President.</p>
      <p>Cassidy began his career as a film editor in the 1970s working on documentaries and political advertisements. Over the course of his professional career, Cassidy has edited more than 40 films, including <title render="italic">Tuck Everlasting</title> and <title render="italic">An Inconvenient Truth</title> (2006). He has also formed a close working relationship with Sean Penn, editing all of the films that Penn has directed. He has been nominated for several Academy Awards and won the Best Documentary Editing Academy Award for <title render="italic">An Inconvenient Truth</title>. <title render="italic">An Inconvenient Truth</title> also  won the award for Best Documentary Feature. Cassidy's professional accomplishments also include election to the American Film Editors society.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Jay Cassidy photograph collection covers Cassidy's student days at the University of Michigan (1967-1970). The collection consists of approximately 5000 original 35mm negatives and 4,882 digitized copies of the negatives. The images in the collection were taken while Cassidy was a photographer for the student publications <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title> and <title render="italic">Michiganensian</title>.</p>
      <p>Cassidy took the original images on Kodak 35mm black and white film. The scanned images are black and white 5904 by 4000 resolution uncompressed tiff files. Cassidy catalogued each roll of film by subject and gave each frame a unique identifier, which is a combination of the category, date, roll number, and the scan number. The category abbreviations are as follows:</p>
      <p>MD -- Assignments for the <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title>, 1968-1970</p>
      <p>RFK -- Robert Kennedy Campaign, 1968</p>
      <p>DNC --Democratic National Convention in Chicago, 1968</p>
      <p>DC -- Inauguration and March on Washington, 1969</p>
      <p>MNCN -- Photographs taken for <title render="italic">Michiganensian</title>, 1967-1968</p>
      <p>Initially, the Bentley Historical Library asked Cassidy to consider donating a selection of the images he took from 1967 to 1970. Instead of selecting only a portion of images, however, Cassidy donated all of his negatives from 1967 to 1970. He digitally scanned the majority of the negatives. The bulk of these images have never been printed, and, according to Cassidy, were "barely examined by myself or another photo editor as we raced to get the daily paper out."[1] Only one or two of each sequence of photographs was used in <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title>. This collection, therefore, contains a series of images previously unavailable to researchers.</p>
      <p>Cassidy's photographs for the campus yearbook, the <title render="italic">Michiganensian</title>, cover 1967 and 1968 and include images of homecoming parades, football, rugby, intramural sports, and campus groups such as Wyvern and Scabbard and Blade. He also photographed Engineering Council meetings discussing Vietnam War research and protests at a Dow Chemical Company stock holders meeting. Note: Most of the <title render="italic">Michiganensian</title> photos were not scanned and exist only as negatives.</p>
      <p>His work for <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title> included diverse subjects. Among the most prominent were photographs of musical performances and visiting celebrities, politics, and campus unrest. Musical acts include concerts by Joan Baez, the Doors, MC5, Ramsey Lewis, Buffy Sainte Marie, and the 1969 Ann Arbor Blues Festival. A 1967 Johnny Carson Show at Hill Auditorium (negatives only) is covered as is an appearance by author Kurt Vonnegut at Canterbury House and film director Sam Fuller.</p>
      <p>Off campus events photographed by Cassidy for <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title> include the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago (including police intervention in street protests), Richard Nixon's inauguration, March on Washington, Resurrection City and the Poor People's Campaign in Washington, D. C., and 1968 political campaign stops in Indianapolis and Detroit by Robert F. Kennedy, George Wallace campaigning in Lansing, Eugene McCarthy in South Bend, Indiana, and a protest at Eastern Michigan University.</p>
      <p>Other campus subjects include SDS meetings, the White Panther Party, Ann Arbor's police chief, a campus murder at University Towers, Welfare Mothers demonstration, the South University riot, the Ann Arbor Moratorium (Vietnam War protest), Army ROTC protests and a bombing of the campus ROTC building, a student rent strike, and Black Action Movement demonstrations.</p>
      <p>The collection is organized as it was received. It consists of five series: Background Information, Digital Images, Original 35mm Camera Negatives, 1967-1970, Printed Catalogue of Digital Scans, 1967-1970, and Original 35mm Contact Sheets, 1967-1970. The strength of the collection lies in its documentation of student life and American politics in the late 1960s, an era of unrest on college campuses.</p>

The background notes give an overview of the collection, identify <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title> stories with which the photographs are associated, describe Cassidy's organizational schema, and explain his approach to scanning and selecting the images. The inventory also matches contact sheets (if extant) and DVDs to the film rolls.</p>
