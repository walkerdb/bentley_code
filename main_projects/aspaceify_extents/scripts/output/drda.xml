      <p>Mortimer E. Cooley became the dean of the Department of Engineering in 1904 with the firm conviction that privately-sponsored research should be integrated into the College's activities. This idea was popular with neither the faculty nor private industry, and it was not until World War I that the College, through the efforts of Clifford D. Holley, acting chairman of the Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, interested the Michigan Manufacturers' Association in sponsoring research. Largely on the strength of this activity, the regents in 1919 created the new Department of Engineering Research within the College of Engineering. The department's purpose was to foster privately sponsored research. Its emphasis was on basic research, rather than routine testing and analysis.</p>
      <p>The new department's growth was slow. Some faculty members continued to resist the department's work. Private industry proved reluctant to fund projects. Corporations were particularly concerned about a lack of patent protection for discoveries made at the university. Some work was forthcoming, however, and in 1928 a patent trust agreement was approved by the Regents, making it possible for a sponsor of research to reserve any patent rights that a project might generate.</p>
      <p>World War II and the postwar environment fundamentally changed the nature of sponsored research and its source of funding. Prior to the war sponsored research had been almost exclusively engineering projects. During and immediately after the war, sponsored research in the physical sciences grew dramatically. Equally significant was the change in the source of funds and their increase. In 1940 the department received two dollars in private money for every one dollar in public funds. Total sponsored research then amounted to about $158,000. In the academic year 1945 sponsored research had grown to over one million dollars. Three-quarters of that sum came from public funds.</p>
      <p>Recognizing both the broadening of sponsored research as well as the tremendous increase in funding, the Regents in 1948 reconstituted the Department of Engineering Research outside of the College of Engineering as the Engineering Research Institute (ERI). The ERI was given responsibility for fostering and overseeing non-University funded research activities in the fields of engineering and the physical sciences. As a part of this responsibility the Aeronautical Research Center, located at Willow Run Airport, was placed under the ERI's jurisdiction in 1949.</p>
      <p>Sponsored research continued to grow at the University at phenomenal rates. By the academic year 1951 it had reached two million dollars per year. The areas of sponsored research also continued to grow. The Medical School, in particular, began to receive large grants of funds for specific projects. To cope with this continued growth in the breadth and volume of sponsored research, the Regents, in 1958, reorganized the ERI, renaming it the University of Michigan Research Institute (UMRI). While UMRI was empowered to foster as well as oversee research throughout the University, in practice the organization exercised only administrative oversight tasks. It did not choose to sponsor any projects, and operational control of projects reporting to the ERI was transferred to the various teaching departments or to the Willow Run Laboratories. The vacuum created by the decision of the UMRI not to undertake the fostering of research was also filled by the creation of the Institute of Science and Technology.</p>
      <p>In 1959 UMRI's focus was shifted by the creation of the position of Vice President for Research. While created independently of the vice-president, UMRI quickly became the administrative office through which the Vice President for Research worked. In 1961 this <title render="italic">de facto</title> arrangement was formalized with the reorganization of UMRI as the Office of Research Administration (ORA). ORA served formally as the administrative arm of the Vice President for Research and bore primary responsibility for relieving sponsored project's technical staff from involvement with non-technical, procedural matters. ORA's jurisdiction covered the entire University. It employed, in 1962, over one hundred individuals.</p>
      <p>At its formation ORA, reflecting the office's long history, was primarily research oriented. Throughout the 1960s, however, the office's mission broadened to include sponsored grants in non-research areas such as teaching. This slow but constant broadening of authority led to one more reorganization of the office in 1973. At that time, it became the Division of Research Development and Administration, retaining all of the functions given to the ORA at its creation in 1961, as well as formally adding to the office the responsibilities that it had accrued during the 1960s.</p>

      <p>The records of the Division of Research Development and Administration (1919-1996) encompass both the DRDA and all of its predecessor organizations. The papers have been divided into seven major series: Governing and Oversight Bodies (1919-1964), Staff and Committee Records (ca. 1922-1979), Administrative Files (1922-1972), Correspondence Files (1943-1972), Willow Run Laboratories (1946-1966), Directors' Files, and several boxes of Research Grant Files on microfilm. There are also four smaller series: the Engineering College Research Council (1959-1961), Review of the DRDA - Report to Harold Shapiro, 1980, Engineering Research Institute - miscellaneous research reports, Photographs, and Programmed Research Information System at Michigan (PRISM) Reports.</p>

          <p>Included in the Governing and Oversight Bodies series is material from the Regents (1919-1945), minutes of the organization's executive body (1920-1964) and files of the Vice President for Research (1957-1964). The Regent's material consists of excerpts from the official proceedings regarding research at the university, and communications sent to the regents by DRDA and its predecessors. The minutes of the executive body (which has various names under DRDA's predecessors) represents an apparently complete set of records from 1920 until 1964. The files of the Vice President for Research are those of Ralph A. Sawyer, first individual to hold that office. They are arranged alphabetically and are particularly interesting for information about the Great Lakes Research Institute (1956-1963) and the Institute of Science and Technology (1957-1964). There is also information about funding for the Aerospace Building, obtained through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and a proposed missile range on Michigan's Keweenaw peninsula.</p>

          <p>Staff and Committee Records have been divided into four subseries: minutes, administrative file, financial records, and newspaper clippings. Minutes of staff meetings are complete from 1948 to 1964. The administrative file (1948-1979) is largely that of Dennis Cebulski. It deals primarily with various problems encountered by the Office of Research Administration (ORA) and DRDA in their efforts to rationalize the administration of grant funds at the university. The office also served as a data-collecting agency, and so a number of completed questionnaires are found in this file. Financial records consist of two types of documents, project ledgers and various statements of overall research. The project ledgers detail expenses for specific research projects and are arranged by account number. They date from ca. 1922 to 1948. Balance sheets, monthly statements and trial balance make up most of the remainder of the financial records and date from 1940 to 1950. Newspaper clippings include a very few items from 1927 and a group of items beginning in 1941 and ending in 1955.</p>

          <p>The Photographs (located in boxes 12, 13, and 20) fall into three subseries: prints of images used or considered for publication in the <title render="italic">Annual Report</title> or <title render="italic">Research News</title> or its predecessors <title render="italic">ERI News</title> and <title render="italic">UMRI News</title>); negatives produced by the DRDA Photographic Services; and photographs from the Administrative Files (1922-1972). For the first two subseries, the prints are arranged by the year in which they were used. To find prints related to a particular subject, the researcher should look at the publications in the Bentley Library printed collection, then go to the folder for the year in which photos of the desired subject were used. Negatives of many of these photos are found in the Photographic Services negative files, which are arranged by subject. Some miscellaneous prints are also arranged by subject. The Administrative File photographs are mostly taken from in-house reports, although there are some miscellaneous images at the end of the series. The photographs in this last series are arranged by subject. The photographs include images of researchers, research equipment, and research projects, especially engineering and medical research at the University of Michigan; photos of campus scenes and buildings, especially related to the early development of North Campus; also a few color negatives of Michigan travel scenes.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Files series covers the fifty-year period from 1922 to 1972, although the majority of the material falls into the fifteen years between 1950 and 1965. The records are basically a subject file, arranged alphabetically, except for the first three folders which give some history on the DRDA and its predecessors. The "Annual Reports" offer fairly complete coverage of the main office from the 1920s to the mid-1960s. There are also reports from smaller departments within the DRDA, such as the Cooley Electronics Laboratory and the Office of Business Manager for Sponsored Research. Another major series is that of "Committees," which is a catch-all heading for any group called such. All the committee records were brought together here. Other major series include "Buildings," "Laboratories," and "Research," which includes major projects run by the DRDA.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence Files cover the years from 1943 to 1972. Again, as with the Administrative Files, the majority of material covers the 1950s and early 1960s. The series is divided into two major subseries: "University of Michigan Correspondence" and "Non-University of Michigan Correspondence." The University of Michigan Correspondence contains letters and memos to and from university administrators, colleges, schools, centers, and institutes. Most of the correspondence is not outstanding, but does establish the relationship between the DRDA and the research community at the university. One file, that of Vice-President (for Research) Ralph A. Sawyer does contain more substantive information and helps document the relationship between the newly-founded Office of the Vice-President for Research and the renamed UMRI.</p>

          <p>The Directors' Files contain the records of James Lesch, director of the DRDA from the early 1970s to the mid 1980s and Allen Steiss, director from 1988 to 1996. The James Lesch subseries is divided into three broad categories: "Subject Files," "DRDA Correspondence Files," and "Chronological Files." The subject files contain information about the administrative aspects of both modern-day research and the running of a research unit in a large university. They are closely tied with the records of the Office of the Vice-President for Research. The second and third series are the un-edited run of correspondence and other materials that would comprise a chronological file from 1971 to 1988. The Allen Steiss subseries is similarly divided into "Correspondence Files," containing monthly in/out files for the entire period of his directorship, and "Topical Files."</p>

          <p>The Research Grant Files comprise 326 rolls of microfilm housed in five boxes, on which are stored copies of grant files that were destroyed after microfilming. The files date from 1926 to 1969, and are arranged according to date and project number. An index identifying which project number appears on which reel is contained in box 26. A partial file of project numbers and dates is also contained in box 26. A card catalog of projects was maintained by DRDA and has not been transferred to the archives.</p>
