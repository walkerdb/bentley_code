        <emph render="bold">Beginnings</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The idea for a dictionary of Middle English goes back to 1919, when William A. Craigie, the third editor of the <title render="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</title> (<title render="italic">OED</title>), proposed a series of period dictionaries of English to extend and supplement the treatment in the <title render="italic">OED</title>. By 1925, when Craigie refined his proposal, the dictionaries he envisaged were for Old English (before 1175), Middle English (1175-1500), the Tudor and Stuart period (1500-1675), Modern English (1675 to the present), Older Scottish (circa 1375 to circa 1700), Modern Scottish (circa 1700 to the present), and American English.</p>
      <p>The available dictionaries of Middle English at the time Craigie was writing were either highly selective or incomplete (as in the case of Ewald Flügel's dictionary of a single writer, Geoffrey Chaucer, left unfinished at Flügel's death in 1914) or containing only brief glosses and with either just references to illustrative examples or a selection of (usually fragmentary) quotations (as in the case of Francis Stratmann's comprehensive <title render="italic">Middle-English Dictionary</title>, revised by Henry Bradley in 1891). The fullest treatment of the Middle English vocabulary at the time was to be found in the <title render="italic">OED</title>, which in its soon-to-be-completed first edition (1928) devoted approximately eight per cent of its over 15,000 pages to this period, but the <title render="italic">OED</title> was intended primarily as a dictionary of Modern English, and Middle English usage, though adequately presented as background for later usage, is not treated from the point of view of the period, which has its own unique characteristics.</p>
      <p>In 1922 the Middle English Language Group of the Modern Language Association of America (MLA) began to take an interest in the project of a comprehensive Middle English dictionary, and by 1925 the MLA had assumed responsibility for promoting the compilation of such a dictionary. In that year Cornell University received a two-year grant from the Heckscher Foundation to begin work on it, with Clark S. Northup as Editor in Charge. Flügel's Chaucer materials were turned over to the project, and Northup was able to secure from Oxford University Press the Middle English slips from A through G collected for the <title render="italic">OED</title> (amounting to approximately 130,000 slips). All of these materials remained at Cornell until 1930 and were supplemented there during this period under Northup's supervision. The supplementation involved primarily the excerpting of various Middle English texts: from the approximately 20,000 pages read, about 175,000 quotations were copied out, frequently in shortened form, on 3" x 5" cards (in some later <title render="italic">MED</title> reports, the number of slips generated at Cornell is estimated to be 240,000). By 1928 work on the dictionary was in serious jeopardy, the funds from the Heckscher Foundation having been exhausted.</p>
      <p>The project's connection with the University of Michigan began in early 1930, when the University invited the MLA to move the dictionary to Ann Arbor. The reason for the invitation was that it was thought that the presence of the dictionary would benefit the <title render="italic">Early</title> <title render="italic">Modern English Dictionary</title> (<title render="italic">EMED</title>, 1475-1700), which since 1928 had been in progress at the University under the direction of Charles C. Fries and to which the <title render="italic">OED</title> had already donated its entire stock of quotations for the Early Modern period. The invitation was accepted, the Cornell materials (including Flügel's materials and the <title render="italic">OED</title> slips from A to G) were transferred to the University of Michigan, and Professor Samuel Moore of the Department of English was chosen as editor. The <title render="italic">OED</title>'s Middle English slips from H to Z were already in Ann Arbor by this time, the total donation (A through Z) amounting to approximately 430,000 slips, including both those used in the printed dictionary and those rejected; and in the next few years the slips prepared for the 1933 <title render="italic">OED</title> Supplement were also transferred to the University of Michigan. In 1931 the Rockefeller Foundation, through the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), began to contribute funds to the project, supplementing the University's contribution.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Moore era (1930-1934)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>During Samuel Moore's editorship the main activities of his small staff were testing the stock of available quotations for inclusiveness and accuracy and carrying out an extensive and systematic reading program in order to supplement the original collection of citations. The nucleus of the <title render="italic">MED</title>'s collection was the <title render="italic">OED</title> donation, which provided a good start, but it had certain omissions and biases. Moore tried to fill in the gaps by enlisting most of the outstanding Middle English scholars of the time, as well as others, not to mention members of his own staff (well over 100 people were involved), and they read as many of the published Middle English texts as they could, along with a number of texts still in manuscript. At the same time, Moore evaluated the usability of Flügel's materials for the special purposes of the <title render="italic">MED</title> and decided to set them aside because they were "heterogeneous in character" and to a large extent "in a highly disordered state" (see Moore's 1931 progress report to the ACLS [October 1932, p. 106]). He preferred instead to rely upon the <title render="italic">Concordance to the Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer</title> by J.S.P. Tatlock and A.G. Kennedy (1927) and his own reading program to round out the <title render="italic">OED</title> materials. By mid-1934, some 66,000 additional pages of Middle English texts had been read or reread, and 280,000 additional quotations taken out, with the result that the collection had grown to nearly 900,000 slips. Also during Moore's editorship a dialect survey, based on 310 documents from 208 known localities, was completed, by Moore himself along with his colleagues Sanford Meech and Harold Whitehall; it was published shortly after Moore's death as "Middle English Dialect Characteristics and Dialect Boundaries," in <title render="italic">Essays and Studies in English and Comparative Literature</title> pp. 1-60 (1935), and for many years thereafter was the standard work on the subject.</p>
      <p>Though Moore had not worked out his editing procedures in detail before he died, he was in the process of formulating an editing plan, the principal features of which can be gathered from his correspondence with scholars in the United States and Europe. As Hans Kurath summarized them in a confidential report, dated November 15, 1946, to the University's Committee on Dictionaries, "The main entries . . . were to be in the Southeast Midland form; forms and spellings from other dialects were to be systematically treated . . . preference was to be given to 'illustrative quotations for word meaning' from 'passages which are the clearest and least ambiguous evidence of the meaning' . . . for early and late quotations and for forms 'only the more definitely dated texts' were to be used [and] cruces were not to be quoted in the Dictionary . . ." (p. 5). Moore thought that it would have been premature to experiment with editing because the material was incomplete, but during 1933 and 1934 he did prepare a few specimens, with entries borrowed from the <title render="italic">OED</title>, to circulate among scholars (see Moore's 1933 progress report to the ACLS [October 1934, pp. 102, 105-6]). Some pre-editing and sub-editing were done on certain letters, however: these two procedures involved, respectively, "identifying all obscure, doubtful, and ambiguous words, and alphabetizing the quotations" and "alphabetizing into one alphabet all . . . quotations for words that are immediately identifiable" (from Knott's 1935 progress report to the ACLS [July 1936, p. 105]).</p>
      <p>Moore died unexpectedly, and prematurely (aged 56), in August of 1934 from complications after an operation. Shortly thereafter Thomas A. Knott, who had been the general editor of <title render="italic">Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language</title> (1934), was chosen as his successor; between then and Knott's arrival in Ann Arbor in February of 1935 Sanford Meech was interim head of the project.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Knott era (1935-1945)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Thomas Knott's editorship was beset by difficulties arising in part from the Depression and the depletion of the staff during World War II and in part from changes in editorial policy. The Rockefeller Foundation (through the ACLS) stopped its support just a year after he arrived in Ann Arbor, which meant that beginning in February of 1936 the University of Michigan (through the Department of English and the Horace H. Rackham Foundation primarily) had to bear the entire financial burden of the project. Confronted with an uncertain future, Knott decided to limit the dictionary to approximately 4,000 pages (later raised to 4,500) and to change radically the editing plan that Moore had in mind. It was now to include full and exact definitions, considerable encyclopedic knowledge about the Middle Ages, limited treatment of forms and spellings (including dialectal spellings), and very few illustrative quotations.</p>
      <p>At one point Knott proposed using as few as only the earliest and the latest quotations for each sense; at another, the earliest and usually several others; at yet another, the earliest, the latest, and one other. (For the outlines of Knott's editing plan, which was never formalized, see: Knott's 1935 progress report to the ACLS [July 1936, p. 109]; unpublished descriptions of the <title render="italic">MED</title> by Knott from 1935 and 1941, along with the unpublished "Stylebook of the Middle English Dictionary," presumably written by Knott in 1936; and Kurath's summary on p. 7 of his unpublished 1946 report.)</p>
      <p>As Kurath characterized Knott's editing plan in his unpublished 1946 report, it "was ill-conceived and unfortunate. It attempted to do what cannot be done satisfactorily and failed to do what can be done well. It did not square with our resources and failed to take into account the extent of our knowledge in the linguistic field; on the other hand, it did not recognize the as yet insuperable limitations in our knowledge of semantics . . .and of Medieval science and technology" (p. 8).</p>
      <p>During his editorship, Knott and his staff prepared entries for the letters A, B, C, D, L, and parts of M in accordance with his editing plan. In 1937 a thirteen-page specimen of L was printed and circulated to a number of scholars (medievalists, historical linguists, etc.); this specimen caused disappointment and produced serious criticism from some reviewers, and the Executive Council of the MLA decided against printing it in the form in which it had circulated.</p>
      <p>In April of the next year, 1938, based primarily on the limited financial resources available and as a result of a recommendation from Kenneth Sisam of Oxford University Press, the University's Committee on Dictionaries (which was responsible for both the <title render="italic">MED</title> and the <title render="italic">EMED</title>) decided to suspend work on the <title render="italic">MED</title> and combine the staffs of the <title render="italic">MED</title> and the <title render="italic">EMED</title> and set them to editing the letter A for the latter dictionary. It became clear, after nearly a year of experimentation with this arrangement, that it would be impossible to meet Sisam's (and Craigie's) expectations for the <title render="italic">EMED</title>, and in March of 1939 the Committee on Dictionaries, on Fries's recommendation, decided that work on the <title render="italic">EMED</title> should be postponed indefinitely and all of the University's resources put into producing the chronologically prior <title render="italic">MED</title></p>
      <p>In 1940 a forty-eight-page typed specimen of letter A of the <title render="italic">MED</title> was circulated to a smaller group than the previous specimen (primarily the MLA's Advisory Committee for the <title render="italic">MED</title> and Oxford University Press, the intended publisher); based on shortcomings in it as determined by the Advisory Committee, the Executive Council of the MLA decided that it could not "give a blanket endorsement to the standards . . . prevailing" at that time at the <title render="italic">MED</title> (see <title render="italic">PMLA</title> 57 [1942, p. 1206]). Editing continued into B and then C, though with a depleted staff because of World War II, and no further specimens were circulated during Knott's editorship.</p>
      <p>Knott and his staff did, however, make substantial additions to the collection of quotations: in addition to arranging for cut-ups of the <title render="italic">OED</title>, E.A.F. Mätzner's <title render="italic">Wörterbuch</title> (1878-91, with additions to 1900), the Bradley-Stratmann <title render="italic">Dictionary</title> (1891), the Tatlock and Kennedy <title render="italic">Concordance</title> (1927), the blueprints of John Trevisa's translation of Bartholomeus Anglicus's <title render="italic">De Proprietatibus Rerum</title>, and other texts (which were then pasted on slips by Works Project Administration and National Youth Administration workers and filed with the quotations for the convenience of the editors), new reading was done in areas which had been either slighted or ignored before, e.g., (1) English words in Latin and Old French documents, which are a rich source of the names of everyday items, customs, taxes, and the like, and (2) place and personal names, which often provide the first occurrences of words remaining from Old English and Old Norse and, for personal names, from Anglo-French. It has been estimated that by 1944, the year before Knott's death, the collection of slips had grown to 1,360,400.</p>
      <p>Knott was on sick leave from March of 1945 until his death in August, and early in that period a search for a new editor began. After looking at a number of possibilities in the spring of 1945, the Committee on Dictionaries finally decided on Hans Kurath, who was chairman of the Division of Modern Languages at Brown University and director of the <title render="italic">Linguistic Atlas of the United States and Canada</title>. From March of 1945 until Kurath's appointment later in the year, associate editor Hereward T. Price was interim head of the <title render="italic">MED</title>.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Kurath era (1946-1961)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In the fall of 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, the University of Michigan reaffirmed its intention to see the <title render="italic">MED</title> through to completion. Hans Kurath began his editorship in March of 1946 and by the end of the year had drawn up a formal editing plan. This plan, which is closer to the one envisioned by Moore, had three main components and was based on what Kurath believed could be done well. First, there was to be a full display of quotations from the collection. As Kurath put it in his unpublished report of 1946, "We have an unsurpassed collection of quotations from all M[iddle] E[nglish] sources and must display it fully in the Dictionary. The quotations, our primary evidence for M[iddle] E[nglish] usage, will retain their value undiminished long after the opinions expressed by the editors in the definitions and the arrangement of the senses will have been superseded (or viewed with the skepticism with which we now approach the semantic and historical treatment of the vocabulary in Grimm's great German Dictionary (1854-) or in the earlier volumes of the monumental Oxford Dictionary (1888-))" (p. 9). Second, there was to be a systematic treatment of "the formal features of M[iddle] E[nglish]spellings, grammatical forms and regional variants," the evidence for which was "ready to hand in our great collection of quotations and texts from all the dialect areas of England" (p. 9). And, finally, the meanings of the Middle English words were to be conveyed "in the briefest form possible--by giving the Modern English equivalents (with clarifying comments, when needed) and resorting to explicit definition only when translation into M[oder]n E[nglish] is not feasible or [is] misleading" (p. 9).</p>
      <p>Kurath also observed that Middle English usage varies so greatly during the period, both chronologically and regionally, that only a dictionary of considerable size could do justice to English usage of this age, which is also the formative period for a large part of the Modern English vocabulary. He therefore decided, early in 1947, that the <title render="italic">MED</title> should run to approximately 8,000 pages, which would allow him to present a considerable part of the quotations stored in the files and thus produce a dictionary of independent value that would serve scholars for years to come.</p>
      <p>The bibliographical apparatus also presented a formidable problem, which needed to be solved before editing progressed too far. As Kurath explained it in his annual report on the <title render="italic">MED</title> for 1947:</p>
      <p>The bibliographical apparatus of the MED, as it was in 1946, was found to be quite inadequate for our purposes. It had simply accumulated over a period of years and had never been systematically reviewed. Much of it had been taken over uncritically from the O[E]D or culled piece-meal from the introductions to edited texts. Some texts were assigned composition dates, others MS [manuscript] dates (which sometimes are a century apart). For some texts the MS date reflected the opinions of early paleographers who were inclined to push the MS dates rather far back; for others the more conservative dating of recent paleographers was accepted. In some cases different texts from one and the same MS, written by one and the same hand, had very different dates. Some texts were quoted under two or three different titles without anyone being aware of it. (pp. 2-3)</p>
      <p>A thorough overhauling of the bibliographical apparatus was undertaken between 1946 and 1949 by Margaret Ogden, Charles Palmer, and Richard McKelvey, and the system that was adopted contained the innovation of what has been called the "double-dating" feature. As Kurath put it in his 1947 report, "We have decided to assign the MS date to all texts, and to add the composition date in parentheses if the text was composed a quarter of a century or more earlier than the date of the MS from which we quote. Paleographic evidence gives us a fairly reliable approximate date for all the MSS, whereas the composition date is often highly conjectural. Mixing MS dates and composition dates, as in the past, is very misleading" (p. 3).</p>
      <p>Between 1946 and 1952 editing began on E and then progressed to F (A, B, C, and parts of D had already been edited according to Knott's plan but were postponed for re-editing until Kurath's plan had been tried out on E and F), all slips were refiled using Southeast Midland headwords, the dating of manuscripts was set by correspondence with librarians and scholars, and the short titles with their dates (or "stencils," as they were called at the <title render="italic">MED</title>) were put into final form.</p>
      <p>Before World War II the University of Michigan had an understanding with the Clarendon Press in Oxford that the <title render="italic">MED</title> would be published there, with a subvention from the University. When negotiations were resumed in 1950, printing costs had risen so sharply and the potential European market for the <title render="italic">MED</title> had shrunk so drastically that the University felt unable to meet the increased financial demands. On the recommendation of Kurath and the University's Committee on Dictionaries, the University of Michigan Press declared its willingness to publish the <title render="italic">MED</title> by offset if the delegates of the Clarendon Press would release the University from the original understanding; the release was granted in April of 1951. In 1952 the first fascicle (the first part of E) was published, and from then until the end of publication in 2001 the final camera-ready copy for the fascicles (which were normally of 128 pages) was prepared by the <title render="italic">MED</title> staff in its offices, then printed lithographically and bound in Ann Arbor by Cushing-Malloy, Inc., and finally distributed and marketed by the University of Michigan Press.</p>
      <p>Two years later Kurath published a description of the editing plan and a full bibliography, in a fascicle entitled <title render="italic">Plan and Bibliography</title> (1954), and from then until the end of his editorship in 1961 the editing progressed slowly but deliberately, with a staff that fluctuated between four and seven mostly part-time editors (many of whom were also part-time faculty in the Department of English), reaching the beginning of the letter G (and publication of all fascicles from A through F).</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Kuhn era (1961-1983)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Sherman M. Kuhn became editor on Kurath's retirement in 1961. Kuhn had come to Michigan as associate editor in 1948 from what is now Oklahoma State University and had considerable first-hand experience under Kurath. During the first thirteen years of his editorship (1961-1974) the editing continued to progress slowly but deliberately and by the end of 1974 had reached the middle of the letter M. Kuhn's editorial staff consisted of six or seven mostly part-time editors and included John Reidy from the University of Western Ontario, who spent the 1960-61 academic year as a visiting lecturer at the University of Michigan and then, on Kuhn's succession, became associate editor of the <title render="italic">MED</title>. Fascicles continued to appear at an average rate of two per year during these years, progressing from G to the end of L.</p>
      <p>From 1930 to 1974 the project had been supported almost entirely by the University of Michigan, except for the assistance in the 1930s, already mentioned, from the Rockefeller Foundation through the ACLS. But, in order to hasten the completion of the editing, a decision was made in early 1974 by University administrators for the project to solicit external funding. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation was approached, and in the winter of 1974-1975 application was made for funds to expand the editorial staff. The application was successful, and in 1975 the project was awarded a grant of $950,000, which enabled it to appoint seven new full-time editors in 1975-1976 and move to larger quarters. In 1980 the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) contributed matching funds for the Mellon grant.</p>
      <p>Between 1975 and the end of Kuhn's editorship, with a staff that fluctuated between eleven and thirteen editors (nearly all full time), the editing proceeded at a somewhat faster rate. Fascicles continued to appear at an average rate of two per year, progressing from M to the end of P. Up through 1983, as during Kurath's era, the final copy for the fascicles continued to be produced on two IBM Executive typewriters (one for the secretarial font and the other for the boldface font).</p>
      <p>In the spring of 1977 the Office of the Vice President for Research ordered a review of the <title render="italic">MED</title>, partly as a matter of periodic routine for all of its units (which the <title render="italic">MED</title> had become in 1975) and partly to assess the progress of the project and its goals for completion two years after receiving the Mellon grant. Beginning with an internal self-evaluation in June, followed by a visit from three external reviewers in August and their report in the fall, the review resulted in December in a set of recommendations to alleviate the backlog of copy waiting to be reviewed, to provide additional support to the editors, and in general to move the project along to completion expeditiously.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the most urgent recommendation, a search for a co-editor, to assist Kuhn with the reviewing and to become editor upon his retirement, began in the winter of 1978. Later in the year a British scholar was offered the position, and he came to Ann Arbor in the summer of 1979 for a trial period, intending to return in the fall of 1980. But he never completed the necessary documentation for a visa, and the offer of the position was withdrawn by the University in August of 1981. A new search was constituted shortly thereafter, and Robert E. Lewis, professor of English at Indiana University, was chosen as co-editor, the appointment to take effect in the fall of 1982.</p>
      <p>For a while in the 1960s and 1970s, there was renewed interest in the University of Michigan's Early Modern English materials, which had been put aside indefinitely in 1939. R.C. Alston of Leeds University proposed to make use of the Michigan materials to prepare a dictionary of Tudor English (1475-1640), but faculty members in the Department of English concluded that the University was not prepared at that time to embark on a project as large as this. But local interest in such a project resumed, and Richard W. Bailey wrote a report in 1968 laying out the research that would need to be done for it. Thanks to a grant from the NEH in the early 1970s, Bailey, James Downer, and Jay L. Robinson were able to produce <title render="italic">Early Modern English Materials</title> (1975), a print handbook and bibliography with a microfiche index to a million words from the <title render="italic">EMED</title> files. For some years after 1975 it was hoped that work on a full-fledged dictionary could continue after the <title render="italic">MED</title> was completed, but that hope was abandoned and in 1994 the materials sent to the Oxford University Press for use in the third edition (in progress) of the <title render="italic">OED</title>.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Lewis era (1982-2001)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>During 1982-1983 Robert E. Lewis worked with Kuhn during Kuhn's last year on the University of Michigan faculty, becoming editor-in-chief on Kuhn's retirement in 1983. During Lewis's editorship, as during Kurath's and Kuhn's, the reading program, which began under Moore in the 1930s, was continued, as editions of unpublished Middle English texts began to appear with ever-increasing frequency after World War II (and especially from the 1970s onward) and many previously edited texts began to be reedited. These were read by the staff, as they came to their attention and as time allowed, and quotations extracted from them for use in the words still to be edited.</p>
      <p>Between 1982 and 1996, with a staff that again fluctuated between seven and thirteen editors (mostly full time), the editing continued to proceed at the faster rate, despite the fact that the amount of data was increasing, through the continuing extraction of quotations from newly edited texts. In 1996, as the editing was nearing its end, the number of editors had to be reduced, and, finally, in late 1997, approximately fifty years after it began according to Kurath's plan, the editing was completed by the three editors who were chosen to remain.</p>
      <p>In 1982 the NEH awarded the project its second grant (with four additional ones to come between 1985 and 1994), in both outright and matching funds, and in 1985 and again in 1988 the Mellon Foundation made two additional large awards. From then to the end of 1996 the editing was supported jointly by the Mellon Foundation and the National Endowment. In 1993, however, when application was made to the NEH for the one last editing grant it needed, the matching funds from the Mellon Foundation were nearly exhausted, and the project undertook a three-year fund-raising campaign in North America to raise replacement funds. Thanks to an initial gift (and subsequent gifts) from A. Richard Diebold, Jr., and to contributions from well over two hundred individuals and institutions, the project was able to meet its matching-fund requirement, with enough left over to assist in completing the last stages of the editing in 1996-1997. Continued funding from the University of Michigan, primarily through the Office of the Vice President for Research, supported the other parts of the project to its conclusion in 2001.</p>
      <p>In early 1984, after exploring various word-processing and printing systems during the previous year and a half, the project replaced its typewriter-generated production system in use since 1952 with a computer-assisted system, which allowed the <title render="italic">MED</title>, beginning with the Q-fascicle and <title render="italic">Plan and Bibliography Supplement I</title>, to update and revise its fonts and to increase its rate of publication to an average of three fascicles per year between Q and the final X-Y-Z fascicle in 2001. (The increased rate of publication can be attributed partly to an increase in the amount of reviewed copy, thanks to the use of one or more reviewers in addition to the editor-in-chief from 1983 on, and partly to a strict timetable for completing the final stages of the project between 1996 and 2001.) From Q through S the format of the earlier typewriter-generated pages was kept, but with the first T-fascicle, thanks to a customized package of Times Roman softfonts, some formatting changes were incorporated to increase readability (the most important of which were boldfaced dates and italicized short titles for the Middle English texts), and these changes continued through the rest of the alphabet.</p>
      <p>With the publication of the final X-Y-Z fascicle in the summer of 2001, the completed <title render="italic">MED</title> proper runs to 14,939 pages in 115 fascicles (combined into thirteen volumes), with 54,081 separate entries and 891,531 quotations. The final figure of 14,939 pages is nearly double the 8,000 that Kurath had projected. That is partly because the definitions became more elaborate and more detailed as the <title render="italic">MED</title> progressed, but primarily because the number of illustrative quotations increased, though this was partly by default: there was simply more data added to the files (especially from the fifteenth century) as the editors proceeded through the alphabet.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Post-2001 era</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 2007 the final piece of the <title render="italic">MED</title>, the <title render="italic">Plan and Bibliography, Second Edition</title>, was published. This new edition contains a complete reshaping and rewriting by Lewis of Kurath's original <title render="italic">Plan</title>, with an up-to-date history of the project and a comprehensive guide to the entries and their constituent parts, and a revised <title render="italic">Bibliography</title> by Lewis and Mary Jane Williams, with the assistance of Marilyn S. Miller, of the texts used in the print dictionary, which amounts to over 7100 full entries, nearly half again as many as in the original 1954 bibliography and the 1984 supplemental bibliography combined, with notes on the changes in date, title, manuscript, or edition that took place in the print dictionary between 1952 and 2001.</p>
      <p>Since 1998, thanks to a separate grant from the NEH in the previous year and with support from various units at the University of Michigan, an electronic version of the <title render="italic">MED</title>, under the direction of Frances McSparran of the Department of English and John Wilkin of the University Library, has been available to subscribers online; it constitutes one of the three resources in the <title render="italic">Middle English Compendium</title> (the other two are the HyperBibliography of Middle English, based on the <title render="italic">MED</title> bibliographies, and the Corpus of Middle English Prose and Verse, a series of fully searchable electronic texts linked to the HyperBibliography). The letters A through P of the print <title render="italic">MED</title> were keyboarded and then converted to SGML markup, the electronic files of Q through T were also converted to SGML markup, and the <title render="italic">MED</title> production staff themselves encoded U through Z in SGML, with the result that all of the existing print <title render="italic">MED</title> was made available online by the end of 2001.</p>
      <p>From the early years of publication a print supplement was part of the long-range plan. The files for it began to be organized during Kuhn's editorship, and between then and 2001 they were systematically added to, with the result that by 2001 there were eighteen boxes of alphabetized supplementary materials. Public references to a supplement began to appear by 1961, and in the printed fascicles from R through Z cross-references were inserted to "Suppl." entries.</p>
      <p>The kind of supplement envisioned originally was a short one, in which the obvious errors would be corrected, definitions and etymologies revised that were known to need revision, and the new words in the <title render="italic">MED</title> files added, much like the supplement to the <title render="italic">Scottish National Dictionary</title> (1976). But as work continued through the remainder of the alphabet, it became increasingly clear that, in view of the length of time that had elapsed since the first fascicle appeared (1952) and the changes in editorial practice that had taken place since then, the kind of supplement that would best serve the scholarly community would be a full and systematic one, which, in conjunction with the completed <title render="italic">MED</title>, would provide a coherent whole in which all entries would be similar in treatment, fullness, and coverage from A to Z.</p>
      <p>The cost of producing this fuller kind of supplement, or even the shorter version, was beyond the University's means at the time, but some preliminary work was done during the summer of 2001, after the final fascicle had been sent to the printer, through a grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research awarded to Frances McSparran, when four members of the <title render="italic">MED</title> Production Staff organized and classified the supplementary materials, partially entered the additional quotations into the computer, and proofed them against the texts. Nothing further has been done on these materials since 2001 (except for some work by Lewis leading to an article on a Middle English prefix in 2005), but they are now available for consultation at the Bentley Library.</p>

      <p>In August of 2001 the administrative records and most of the materials pertaining to the history and making of the <title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary</title> (<title render="italic">MED</title>) from its beginnings at the University of Michigan in 1930 up to its completion in 2001 were deposited in the Bentley Historical Library by the project and by the administrative unit responsible for it, the Office of the Vice President for Research. These materials consist primarily of correspondence, administrative records (including budget), files on editorial matters, and miscellaneous files and notes on other matters. In February of 2010 the remainder of the <title render="italic">MED</title> materials was transferred to the Bentley Library from the Buhr Storage Facility, where they had been kept since the fall of 2001, along with the books from the former <title render="italic">MED</title> library (now dispersed), under the supervision of the Special Collections Library. All of these materials form a collection separate from the citation slips used in the printed <title render="italic">MED</title> (along with the supplementary slips), which are now catalogued as Middle English Dictionary Citation Slips. The total number of boxes in the present collection is 91 (of various sizes), amounting to 61 linear feet.</p>
      <p>The Middle English Dictionary records are organized in three major subgroups, RECORDS BY EDITORIAL ERA, MISCELLANEOUS MED MATERIALS, and NON-MED MATERIALS.</p>
      <p>In the first 20 boxes (21 linear feet) the materials are in standard-size boxes in 8 1/2" x 14" folders and are arranged strictly chronologically by the editorial eras of the chief editors: Samuel Moore (1930-1934), Thomas A. Knott (1935-1945), Hans Kurath (1946-1961), Sherman M. Kuhn (1961-1983), and Robert E. Lewis (1982-2001), except that the Moore and Knott eras have been combined because of the difficulty of separating the files, other than correspondence, in those two eras. In the later <title render="italic">MED</title> boxes (21 through 84), the materials are stored in a mixture of formats (8 1/2" x 14" folders, 6 1/2" x 9" cards, 3" x 5" cards and slips, etc.), the organization is topical, though still generally chronological. Non- <title render="italic">MED</title> materials (specifically, the <title render="italic">Early Modern English Dictionary</title> (<title render="italic">EMED</title>) materials) appear at the end (in boxes 79 through 91).</p>

        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>The subgroup RECORDS BY EDITORIAL ERA is organized in series reflecting the tenures of each of the chief MED editors. The series are: Moore-Knott Era, 1930-1945, Kurath Era, 1945-1961, Kuhn Era, 1961-1983, and Lewis Era, 1982-2001 (and later). Each of the series includes subseries relating to content: correspondence, administration and history, editorial matters. Additional subseries pertain to specific matters under particular editors such as the reading program, bibliography, production matters, and non-MED matters.</p>
          <p>Effort was made to retain the arrangement and the order of the original materials insofar as that was possible, but inevitably for the sake of consistency from one editorial era to another we had to adapt the arrangement to the emphases in each era. Correspondence, alphabetically arranged, always appears as the first category for all eras. This includes the chief editor's <title render="italic">MED</title> and professional, scholarly, and academic correspondence (including intra-university correspondence), both to and from him, with notes on the main correspondents, the subjects of the letters, and who else besides the chief editor was involved in answering letters. Each correspondent's letters are arranged chronologically, from earliest to latest. The only exception to this arrangement is in the Moore and Knott correspondence, where some letters were pasted together for filing in <title render="italic">reverse</title> chronological order, as was the custom in the 1930s and 1940s, and these have been kept as they were originally, with the latest on top.</p>
          <p>The correspondence is always followed by administrative records and historical files, alphabetically arranged, which contain information on budget requests and staff salaries by year, the minutes of the various committees either overseeing or participating in the work of the <title render="italic">MED</title> (chiefly the Committee on Dictionaries from 1930 to 1977, the <title render="italic">MED</title> Council and various internal committees thereafter), reports (both annual and miscellaneous), external financial support and grant applications, hiring of editors, ordering of books for the <title render="italic">MED</title> library, equipment inventories, statements of account, and the like.</p>
          <p>Then follow files and records on editorial matters, also alphabetically arranged: these include such topics as bibliography, dialects, editing progress, editors' guides and style books, papers and articles on various subjects pertaining to the <title render="italic">MED</title>, and reviews after publishing began.</p>
          <p>Following these fixed categories appear, where appropriate according to the principal activities of each era, some separate categories: for example, for the reading program (which was an especially important activity in Moore's era, to a lesser extent in Knott's), for the bibliography (which was in the process of being established in Kurath's era), and for production matters (which were particularly extensive in the changeover from typewriters to computers in Lewis's era).</p>
          <p>Finally, for all but one of the editorial eras, there is a category called non- <title render="italic">MED</title> materials, which contains files on the <title render="italic">EMED</title> (these are particularly extensive during the Moore and Knott eras), correspondence other than that pertaining to the <title render="italic">MED</title> if it is extensive, research and editorial matters not directly related to work on the <title render="italic">MED</title>, and occasional files on graduate and undergraduate class matters and civic affairs.</p>

The correspondence from the Moore and Knott eras (1930-1934 and 1935-1945) is extensive (2.6 linear feet), reflecting the historical fact that the project was in its infancy at the University of Michigan and many decisions had to be made, not least those about financial matters at a time of severe economic depression and those having to do with the samples produced during the Knott era.</p>

              <p>Moore's correspondence was primarily with well known and influential Middle English scholars of the time, containing extensive exchanges between Moore and Albert C. Baugh (Pennsylvania; also a member of the Modern Language Association [MLA] Advisory Committee on the <title render="italic">MED</title>), Carleton Brown (MLA), W.F. Bryan (Northwestern), Thomas A. Knott (frequently about their joint publication, <title render="italic">Elements of Old English</title>), Percy Long (MLA), Lorenz Morsbach (Göttingen), Clark Northup (editor of the dictionary when it was housed at Cornell), Henry L. Savage (Princeton), Mary S. Serjeantson (London), James F. Willard (Colorado), R.M. Wilson (Leeds), and many of the volunteer readers of Middle English texts. In addition to Moore, C.C. Fries, Editor of the <title render="italic">EMED</title>, frequently answered letters, as did <title render="italic">MED</title> editors Sanford Meech and James Rettger and sometimes administrative staff members Helen Snyder and Eleanore Stuhlmann.</p>

              <p>Knott's correspondence was with many of the same Middle English scholars as Moore's, as well as with others: Hope Emily Allen (a well known independent scholar who also worked for the <title render="italic">EMED</title> for a time), Baugh, Bryan, H.H. Carter (Indiana; about his dictionary of Middle English musical terms), Sir William Craigie (former editor of the <title render="italic">OED</title>, editor at the time of the <title render="italic">Dictionary of American English</title> at the University of Chicago and the <title render="italic">Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue</title> in Edinburgh), John S. Kenyon (Hiram College; primarily about their joint book, <title render="italic">A Pronouncing Dictionary of American English</title>, published in 1944), Kemp Malone (Johns Hopkins; also a member of the MLA's Advisory Committee), John M. Manly (Chicago), Savage, Kenneth Sisam (Oxford University Press), David Stevens (of the Rockefeller Foundation), J.S.P. Tatlock (California-Berkeley), and Clarence S. Yoakum (Dean of the University of Michigan Graduate School), as well as various volunteer readers. In addition to Knott, Fries, Meech, <title render="italic">MED</title> editor Harold Whitehall, and <title render="italic">EMED</title> editor Hereward Price answered letters.</p>

              <p>From 1930 to 1939 the budgeting for the <title render="italic">MED</title> was combined with that for the <title render="italic">EMED</title>, with Moore and then Knott along with Fries for the <title render="italic">EMED</title> submitting joint budgets. Though money was tight in the early 1930s, Moore was mercifully spared from the financial problems that beset Knott. The project received grants during its early years (1931-1936) from the Rockefeller Foundation (through the ACLS), but that external support ended in February of 1936, and the University of Michigan had to assume the full cost of both projects. The financial limitations were partly responsible for the decisions first, in 1938, to suspend work on the <title render="italic">MED</title> and set the staffs of both the <title render="italic">MED</title> and the <title render="italic">EMED</title> to editing for the <title render="italic">EMED</title> and then, a year later, to resume work on the <title render="italic">MED</title> and postpone the <title render="italic">EMED</title> indefinitely. There is a full file on this subject, not to mention the official decisions themselves, which are in the <title render="italic">MED</title> Council files.</p>

Kurath's main correspondents were members of the former MLA Advisory Committee (for example, Baugh, Long, Malone), as well as Allen, the linguist Hermann Flasdieck (Heidelberg), Arthur G. Kennedy (Stanford), Robert J. Menner (Yale), and Randolph Quirk (University College London and the University of Durham), and the correspondence was frequently about details of his editing plan. Kurath was also a prolific writer of recommendations for colleagues and students.</p>

              <p>The bibliography has its own category (two-thirds of box 9; 0.67 linear foot). When Kurath arrived in 1946, he found the <title render="italic">MED</title> bibliographical apparatus quite inadequate, and during the next three years editors Margaret Ogden, Charles Palmer, and Richard McKelvey systematized and regularized the short titles used for citing texts and reviewed the dates of all manuscripts quoted. Whenever the evidence for dating was inconclusive or opinions by paleographers and editors varied or clashed, the keepers of manuscripts in the various repositories were consulted before the final dates were set. Their replies make up a large part of this category.</p>

              <p>The non- <title render="italic">MED</title> materials at the end of the Kurath era comprise the equivalent of a full box (parts of boxes 10 and 11; 1 linear foot). In addition to his appointment as Editor of the <title render="italic">MED</title> and Professor of English, Kurath continued during his years at the University of Michigan as Director of the <title render="italic">Linguistic Atlas of the United States and Canada</title>, and all of his <title render="italic">Atlas</title> materials are in this last category. The first item is his <title render="italic">Atlas</title> correspondence, which is mainly with fellow American dialectologists (chiefly Raven I. McDavid, Jr., of the University of Chicago, William Moulton of Cornell and Princeton, and others), but also with the British dialectologist Harold Orton, the Romance dialectologist Sever Pop, the well known H.L. Mencken (author of <title render="italic">The American Language</title>), and the Linguistic Society of America (of which Kurath was president in 1941). This correspondence is followed by a number of files on <title render="italic">Atlas</title> business matters and on two books by Kurath that grew out of his <title render="italic">Atlas</title> work. At the end are some files on his University departmental activities.</p>

Head of production Richard McKelvey and associate editor John Reidy occasionally answered letters. Now that the editing plan for the <title render="italic">MED</title> was settled, and the fascicles were appearing on a regular schedule, Kuhn's correspondence frequently involved answering questions from readers and scholars about individual words, usually those not yet published.</p>

              <p>The files for administration and history (boxes 12-13) are particularly full in Kuhn's era, for much <title render="italic">MED</title> staff time was spent on three non-editorial activities. (1) Up to 1974 the editorial staff had been quite small, with progress relatively slow, and the University decided that the project should solicit external funding in order to speed up the completion. Between 1974 and 1977 staff were involved in planning for the solicitation, in applying to the Mellon Foundation, and then (upon receiving a large grant) in hiring seven new full-time assistant editors and moving to larger quarters off-campus. (2) Shortly afterwards, in the spring of 1977 the University administration ordered a review of the <title render="italic">MED</title>, which occupied much of the remainder of that year, with both internal and external evaluations and a final report, with detailed recommendations. (3) The most urgent of these--the appointment of a co-editor to assist Kuhn with reviewing--led to a search that began in the winter of 1978 and continued for well over three years (into the fall of 1981).</p>

              <p>Lewis era (1983-2001). Lewis's correspondence occupies a full box (box 14; 1 linear foot). His main correspondents were Michael Adams (Albright), Larry Benson (Harvard), Christopher Cannon (Cambridge et al.), Margaret Laing (Edinburgh), Hiroyuki Matsumoto (an expert from Japan on the Middle English <title render="italic">Destruction of Troy</title>), Angus McIntosh (Edinburgh), the <title render="italic">OED</title> (beginning with Robert Burchfield, then Edmund Weiner, Elizabeth Knowles, and John Simpson), Eric Stanley (Oxford), and the University of Michigan Press. Letters were occasionally answered by <title render="italic">MED</title> editor Elizabeth S. Girsch. As in Kuhn's era, the correspondence frequently involved answering questions from readers and scholars about individual words, but in addition Lewis often asked for help from specialists on manuscript and textual readings (the responses to these latter letters may usually be found in the relevant word files of the <title render="italic">MED</title> proper, which are also housed at the Bentley Library). Part of Lewis's correspondence from the mid- to late 1990s on was electronic, and many of these messages, along with his replies, were printed out and added to the files.</p>

              <p>Production matters has its own category (three-fifths of box 18 and all of 19 and 20; 2.7 linear feet), divided roughly into two parts: (1) files on the use of computers and (2) style guides for the production staff. (1) Between mid-1982 and late 1983 the project explored, and experimented with, various word-processing and printing systems and, beginning in early 1984, replaced its cumbersome typewriter-generated production system with a computer-assisted system that increased the rate of publication to an average of three fascicles per year between the letter Q in 1984 and the last fascicle in 2001. (2) Between 1983 and 1999 there were so many changes and additions to the production staff that the heads of production during those years, Lidie Howes and Olivia Bottum, decided to standardize, and formalize, the rules and principles of the production process, with the result that they prepared a number of guides and notes on <title render="italic">MED</title> style and made them available to the staff.</p>

            <p>The Reading Notes and Bibliogrpahies series is scomprised of files labeled Moore's Reading Notes, Knott's Notes Reading Notes and Science Bibliography.</p>
            <p>The series Moore's Reading Notes (boxes 23 and part of 24) contains Moore's reading notes (1930-1934). The notes are arranged alphabetically, with each letter arranged by, first, titles or authors of texts and, then, journals or series.</p>
            <p>Knott's Reading Notes (1935-1945) fill out the rest of box 24, made primarily in conjunction with the reading program ongoing at that time. The notes indicate which texts have glossaries, how many pages of text are included, who read them, and how many slips were taken. The series includes two sets of notes, which are, for the most part, arranged alphabetically.</p>
            <p>Science Bibliography (boxes 25-28) contains slips for scientific terms compiled chiefly by Margaret Ogden and Katherine Fellows, two members of the editorial staff, between the late 1930s and the late 1940s. These files contain a variety of materials, ranging from draft entries for scientific words to bibliographical files and notes, to scientific topics and categories, chiefly alchemical.</p>

            <p>The Headword File (boxes 29-38) contains an alphabetical list of <title render="italic">MED</title> headwords, on index cards. The cards have the Middle English headwords at the top left and the <title render="italic">OED</title> headwords, where available, at the top right. This early attempt at a list of headwords, made in the 1930s, was superseded after 1946, when the final list began to be finalized, but remains of interest for anyone trying to reconstruct the early history of the <title render="italic">MED</title>.</p>

            <p>The Editorial and Bibliographic Materials, 1940-2008 series (boxes 39-65) is from the Kurath, Kuhn, and Lewis eras, though they also include files that began in the Moore and Knott eras but continue into the following eras. The series consists of six sub-series: Miscellaneous Files, Bibliography Files, Title Files <title render="italic">MED</title> Library Files, Abbreviations for Periodicals and Serials, the Master Bibliography, and Quoting Instructions.</p>
            <p>The first two-fifths of box 39 contains the Miscellaneous Files sub-series from 1946 to 1954, on a variety of topics: names of readers and consultants, lists of regional texts and manuscripts, a list of manuscript abbreviations used in the <title render="italic">Plan and Bibliography</title> of 1954, a list of short titles not in boxes 39-43, and Kurath's distribution list for the first fascicle (E.1, published in 1952).</p>
            <p>The Bibliography File sub-series begins with the second three-fifths of box 39 and continues through the first quarter of box 43. It is a bibliographical file on cards: specifically, an alphabetically arranged conversion list of pre-Kurath-era titles of Middle English works, with the new short title (or "stencil" as it was called at the <title render="italic">MED</title>) on the same card, below. This list, which was made between the late 1940s and 1952 (before the publication of fascicle E.1), contains what the <title render="italic">MED</title> calls "texts" (the short titles of longer works) and "incipits" (the first few words of a short piece of verse) combined together, unlike the later printed <title render="italic">MED</title> bibliographies (1954, 1984, 2007), which separate the two.</p>
            <p>The <title render="italic">MED</title> Library File sub-series (box 44-46) contains a listing of the books in the former <title render="italic">MED</title> library as it existed in 1976, with later additions up to 2001.</p>
            <p>The Abbreviations for Periodicals and Serials sub-series, alphabetically arranged, and includes information on which text or texts are in each periodical or serial. This list was compiled by <title render="italic">MED</title> bibliographer Mary Jane Williams between 1985 and the mid- to late 1990s.</p>

              <p>The Master Bibliography sub-series (boxes 47-63) contain the master bibliography, alphabetically arranged. This bibliography began in 1947 and was added to, and used, until the end of the project in 2001, and even after, through 2007, when the <title render="italic">Plan and Bibliography</title>, 2nd edition, was published. The bibliography begins with texts (10 boxes of cards), proceeds to incipits (4 boxes), and ends with manuscripts (3 boxes).</p>

              <p>Quoting Instructions (boxes 64-65) contains the quoting instructions for the <title render="italic">MED</title> texts listed there. These instructions were extracted from the books in the former <title render="italic">MED</title> library in 2010, when it was dispersed, and are filed alphabetically by stencil. If a single volume contained more than one text, then the quoting instructions for that volume are filed under the stencil of either the first text in the volume or the main text or author in the volume. Like the master bibliography, these instructions were begun in 1947 and were continued as new texts were added to the library up to 2001.</p>

            <p>The Middle English Texts series(boxes 66-72) contain primarily transcriptions, facsimiles (usually photostats), and microfilms of manuscripts of Middle English texts, which were made or collected from the 1930s to the 1980s. These boxes were assembled from the materials in the former <title render="italic">MED</title> library when it was dispersed in 2010. The transcriptions are usually typed, though some are also handwritten; they and the facsimiles are indicated by an asterisk (*) before the short title, as is the policy in the <title render="italic">MED Plan and Bibliography</title>, 2nd. ed. (2007) for all unpublished sources. For the most part the microfilms are restricted to those that are not in the <title render="italic">British Manuscripts Project</title> (compiled by Lester K. Born; Washington, D.C., 1955), a list of microfilms housed in the University of Michigan Graduate Library. Boxes 66 to 72 also include a few handwritten variant readings from the manuscripts of Chaucer's <title render="italic">Treatise on the Astrolabe</title> as well as a few microfilms of both printed editions of Middle English texts and Latin texts and manuscripts.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>Audio, Digital, and Visual Material, and Artifacts (boxes 73-74) contains miscellaneous audio, digital, and visual materials, along with a few artifacts, from all editorial eras of the <title render="italic">MED</title>. These include: cassettes of remarks on the <title render="italic">MED</title> and on one of its retiring editors; a CD of an hour-long Canadian Broadcasting Co.'s radio show on the <title render="italic">MED</title>; floppy disks of Middle English texts; CD-ROM's of the Middle English Compendium and quotations for the supplement; photographs of <title render="italic">MED</title> editors and staff; slides and transparencies of medieval manuscripts; printed maps; and artifacts such as IBM typewriter balls with Middle English letters used in the early camera-ready copy. (For other photographs, see the Retirements folders in Box 16.)</p>
            <p>Additional visual materials are housed in Box 74, including four printed maps of England (all or part) used by the editors, and six examples of camera-ready pages for the <title render="italic">MED</title>, to illustrate the various stages the printed fascicles went through between 1952 and 2001. These are: <title render="italic">E.1</title> e -- endelonges (1952), the first fascicle to be printed; the original <title render="italic">Plan and Bibliography</title> (1954); <title render="italic">N.1</title> muche -- neigh (1978), a late example of typewriter-composited copy; <title render="italic">Q</title> q -- raiment (1984), the first word-processed fascicle; <title render="italic">S.13</title> spranklinge -- steering (1990), a late example of the word-processed format used from Q through S; and <title render="italic">T.1</title> t -- tasting (1993), the first fascicle with formatting changes to increase readability (boldfaced dates, italicized short titles for Middle English texts, etc.).</p>
            <p>An <title render="italic">MED</title> Sorting Board is also part of the Audio, Digital, and Visual Material, and Artifacts series. Because of its size (26" high, 33" wide, and 11" deep at the bottom) it is housed separately. This particular sorting board was created by <title render="italic">MED</title> associate editor Oscar Johnson in the 1940s, and thereafter each editor had one like it at his or her desk for use in editing: usually, as the first step, for sorting the quotation slips for a word by date, with a slot for each century or part of a century; then, for separating senses or subsenses, with tentative definitions clipped to the backs of the slots into which the illustrative quotations were dropped; next, as the interpretation of senses was refined, for separating the contents of one slot into two or three, or for combining the contents of more than one slot into a single one; and, ultimately, for having the whole word in question arranged and labeled in final form by senses and subsenses along with the relevant quotations for each.</p>

            <p>The Hand-Pulled Cross Reference cards series (box 75) is held in the first half of Box 75, and contains a sample of the cross-references (A-En, W-Z) that were used from the late 1940s through the 1980s, and even into the early 1990s, before the <title render="italic">MED</title> had developed a program to insert them directly from the computerized copy. These cross-references were hand-pulled from both the handwritten copy and the first draft of the composited copy, typed on slips, and then inserted into the final composited copy.</p>

            <p>The remaining three and a half boxes in MISCELLANEOUS <title render="italic">MED</title> MATERIALS (the remainder of 75 through box 78) are made up of the Quotations series, that contains primarily quotations which were donated to, or in a few cases prepared at, the <title render="italic">MED</title> but which were not used in the current printed or online dictionaries. These consist of: Concordance Slips forAvowing of Arthur, Stern Quotations, Cornish Quotations, Cornell Class B Material and MED Reading Program slips.</p>
            <p>Concordance Slips for <title render="italic">Avowing of Arthur</title> (half of box 75) were sent to the <title render="italic">MED</title> in 1939 by Norman Waldorf of San Jose, California. They are alphabetically arranged.</p>
            <p>The Stern Quotations (box 76-77) are quotations sent to the <title render="italic">MED</title> by Professor Gustav Stern of Göteborg in the 1940s, containing miscellaneous words; alphabetically arranged.</p>
            <p>Cornish Quotations (box 77); alphabetically arranged. In letters G through P (1963-1984) of the <title render="italic">MED</title> Cornish quotations from <title render="italic">Origo Mundi</title> and <title render="italic">Pass.Christi</title> in Norris <title render="italic">Anc.Corn.Drama</title> that contained words borrowed from Middle English were included, but this practice was discontinued beginning with <title render="italic">Q</title> (1984); in addition to the unused Cornish quotations, this part of box 77 also contains notes on where in the <title render="italic">MED</title> (<title render="italic">G</title> through <title render="italic">P</title>) Cornish quotations may be found.</p>
            <p>Cornell Class B Material (box 78) contains a selection only. The titles given are a combination of titles in the Cornell material and the short titles in the <title render="italic">Plan and Bibliography</title>, 2nd edition. Editors Meech, Whitehall, and Rettger, in a report of September 30, 1934, after Moore's death, observed that of the 219,000 quotation slips sent to the <title render="italic">MED</title> from Cornell in 1930, 105,000 "were of such slight value because the words recorded on them were adequately represented in the Oxford material and because quotations in them were short or altogether lacking that we put them aside and probably will never touch them again." The <title render="italic">MED</title> referred to these slips as "Cornell Class B Material," and this category also contained those of the additional quotations sent from Cornell in 1942 that were not filed in the boxes during 1942-1943.</p>
            <p><title render="italic">MED</title> Reading Program (in the center of box 78) comprises a small number of slips taken from the Doncaster Corporation manuscript, prepared at an unknown date; arranged by page.</p>

For many years after the postponement of the <title render="italic">EMED</title> in 1939 in favor of the <title render="italic">MED</title>, it was hoped that work on the <title render="italic">EMED</title> could resume after the <title render="italic">MED</title> was completed, but that hope was abandoned and the quotation slips and related materials were sent to Oxford University Press in 1994 for use in the third edition of the <title render="italic">OED</title> (in progress). Thirteen boxes (79-91) are all that remain at the University of Michigan of the materials from the <title render="italic">EMED</title>. These materials are primarily from the 1930s (with one exceptions in boxes 87-91) and are almost exclusively bibliographical.</p>
          <p>The NON- <title render="italic">MED</title> MATERIALS subgroup consists of two series: Bibliographies and Holdings Lists and Manuscript Concordances and Collections by Charles Crawford.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The second series, Manuscript Concordances and Collections by Charles Crawford, comprises four boxes (88 through 91), containing ten files (with varying numbers of manuscript volumes in each, for a total of 27 volumes), arranged alphabetically by manuscript title: <title render="italic">Avisa Series I</title>, <title render="italic">Avisa Series II</title>, <title render="italic">Belvedere, A Breton Concordance</title>, a Concordance to Ben Jonson's Works, a Concordance to John Lyly's <title render="italic">Euphues, an Index to Wits Treasury</title>, a Concordance and Index to "Lines of Poems by Surrey, Wyatt and authors in <title render="italic">Tottel's Miscellany</title>," a Miscellaneous Volume, and a Concordance to <title render="italic">The Paradise of Dainty Devices</title>.</p>
            <p>The writer of nearly all of these volumes was Charles Crawford, though how they made their way into the <title render="italic">EMED</title> Library is unknown. Crawford was a journalist of some kind, as well as a private scholar; he was born in Manchester in 1860 and lived and worked in London. From documents in the <title render="italic">OED</title> archives, Crawford was suggested for work on the dictionary in 1902, and was offered a position, but decided to withdrew because he felt he was not well enough qualified. He did give occasional help and advice to the <title render="italic">OED</title> in the years following, and it may be that the present volumes came to the <title render="italic">EMED</title> along with the Early Modern English slips donated by the <title render="italic">OED</title> in the late 1920s and early 1930s.</p>
            <p>As a scholar and critic, Crawford flourished during the last decade of the 19th century and the first three decades of the 20th century. He began publishing articles on Elizabethen writings in the 1890's chiefly in the journal <title render="italic">Notes &amp; Queries</title> and continued writing articles on related subjects at least through 1929; two volumes of the early articles appeared in his <title render="italic">Collectanea</title> in 1906 and 1907. He edited <title render="italic">England's Parnassus</title> in 1913 and published concordances of the works of Thomas Kyd (1906-10) and Christopher Marlowe (1911-32). His manuscript volumes in the <title render="italic">EMED</title> Library date from between 1895 and "after 1929," though most were written between 1914 and 1929.</p>
            <p>Box 88 contains the first sub-series <title render="italic">Avisa Series I</title> (four volumes), and the second, <title render="italic">Avisa Series II</title> (three volumes). These are collections of English verse (primarily) and some prose of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, with pages consecutively numbered within each sub-series.</p>
            <p>The third sub-series <title render="italic">Belvedere, or The Garden of the Muses</title>, comprises three volumes and is contained in the first half of Box 89. This is a collection of quotations from the compilation entitled <title render="italic">Belvedere</title> (1600), edited by John Bodenham, arranged by subject, in three volumes, with pages consecutively numbered.</p>
            <p>The second half of Box 89 contains volumes 1 through 4 of the fourth sub-series <title render="italic">A Breton Concordance</title>. This is a concordance to the works of Nicholas Breton (1545-1626) and others in eleven volumes and is based on the quotations presented in the seven volumes of <title render="italic">Avisa Series I</title> and <title render="italic">Avisa Series II</title> in Box 88.</p>
            <p>Box 90 contains the remaining seven volumes (5 through 11) of the fourth sub-series <title render="italic">A Breton Concordance</title></p>
            <p>Box 91 contains the fifth through the tenth sub-series. The fifth is "A Concordance to the 1616 Folio edition of Ben Jonson's Works, and the first edition of <title render="italic">Every Man in his Humour</title>." This is in fact primarily a word index based on Crawford's own concordance (not here); in his table of "Contents" Crawford refers to it as "A synopsis of the Concordance."</p>
            <p>The sixth sub-series contains primarily a concordance to John Lyly's <title render="italic">Euphues: The Anatomy of Wyt</title>. <title render="italic">Euphues</title> was first published in 1578, but this concordance is based on Edward Arber's edition published in 1868 or, more likely, the later reprint of it in 1895.</p>
            <p>The seventh sub-series is an Index to " <title render="italic">Wits Treasury</title>, 1598." <title render="italic">Palladis Tamia, Wits Treasury</title> was written by Francis Meres (1565-1647); Crawford's volume is a combined subject index and concordance, but the primary emphasis is on subjects and proper names.</p>
            <p>The eighth sub-series is entitled "Lines of Poems by Surrey, Wyatt and authors in <title render="italic">Tottel's Miscellany</title> and other places arranged in alphabetical order"; it is in fact both a separate concordance and an index of words in these authors.</p>
            <p>The ninth sub-series is a miscellaneous volume, written by both Crawford and others, containing an edition of a play by Robert Armin, a fragmentary concordance to <title render="italic">Hamlet</title>, various subject-indexes to <title render="italic">England's Parnassus</title> (1600), and a fragmentary list of English names and writings mentioned in Robert Burton's <title render="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</title></p>
            <p>The tenth sub-series is a concordance to various editions between 1576 and 1600 of <title render="italic">The Paradise of Dainty Devices</title>. Most of <title render="italic">The Paradise of Dainty Devices</title> was probably compiled by Richard Edwards (?1523-66), though poems by other, later writers were included in the editions.</p>
