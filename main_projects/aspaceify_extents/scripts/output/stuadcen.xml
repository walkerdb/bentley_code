      <abstract>The Students Advocacy Center of Michigan (SAC), established in 1975 in Ann Arbor, was the only organization in Michigan, providing non-legal advocacy to students and their parents who were eligible for general and special public education programs. SAC was involved in numerous controversies involving public school policies and practices. Ruth Zweifler, founding member and director, led SAC and built a statewide presence through activism for students and parents. The record group includes administrative files and other subject files of executive director Ruth Zweifler documenting the Center's advocacy programs, its management and funding sources; includes clippings relating to the Center's support in 1979 of Ann Arbor teachers having training in Black English.</abstract>

      <p>Beginning as a volunteer tutor in Angell School, 1969-1975, Ruth Zweifler led a group of concerned citizens to form the Student Advocacy Center (SAC). Established in 1975, the Student Advocacy Center provided advocacy services for individual public school students and their families to relieve school-related problems and monitored local and state educational agencies for policies and practices that hurt children. Issues focused on school exclusions, such as, drop-out, "push-out," suspension, and expulsion. SAC concerned itself with the relationship between academic competency and exclusion. Finally, SAC attempted to identify support services and strategies to enhance school success for marginal students.</p>
      <p>The by laws and mission statement of SAC went through several revisions after 1975. The SAC has as its current mission statement (May 5, 2001), "Student Advocacy Center of Michigan operates with the conviction that a vigorous public school system that serves all children well is an essential component of a robust democracy. Toward that end the Student Advocacy Center of Michigan advocates on behalf of, and in partnership with, Michigan's children and young adults and their families in order to ensure that those who are educationally unserved, underserved or ill-served receive a free, individualized and equitable education and become fully participating members of their communities."</p>
      <p>SAC took an interventionist approach on the behalf of identified students. The landmark case that brought SAC into the national spotlight was the 1979 case in the court of Judge Charles Joiner in Ann Arbor. A group of African-American parents, with the support of SAC, sued the Ann Arbor Board of Education on the issue of Black English classroom instruction for their children. The suit was resolved in favor of the parents and the Ann Arbor Board of Education was compelled to provide accommodation to African-American students.</p>
      <p>Initially, SAC acted as advocate for Ann Arbor area students and their parents, but in 1988 (<title render="italic">Ann Arbor News</title>, December, 18, 1988), the volunteer group reorganized on a statewide basis with a board of directors, enlarged to thirty members, and a new advisory board. At this time, SAC expanded its focus from individuals to issues on a statewide basis. Up to this point SAC had operated on an annual budget of about $15,000. By broadening the geographic base through board members, SAC hoped to expand its finances as well.</p>
      <p>In 1998, SAC undertook a data gathering project on public school expulsions, contacting school districts directly with requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The resulting report, "Access Denied, "established that 571 children were expelled from 17 of the state's 554 school districts in a two-year period. A FOIA request from SAC to the State of Michigan revealed that data on expulsions statewide did not exist. By conducting an analysis of the SAC case files for 1999-2000, SAC concluded that 71% of expelled students for that period were either Special Education certified, receiving section 504 protections, or had exhibited identifiable risk factors prior to expulsion. These conclusions were used as a basis for expansion of interventions that SAC promoted. In 1999, a Lawyers Committee was created. The Lawyers' Committee set as goals: to demand accurate information about the number and reasons for student expulsions from Michigan public schools, to "spread the word" about the negative effects of student expulsions, and to actively engage state legislators. This committee was composed of attorneys across Michigan who served voluntarily to review state legislation that negatively impacted public school students' right to an education and to advocate legislative change. An Attorney Network was also formed to provide pro bono assistance to cases referred by SAC if a student problem was beyond the SAC mission. At this time SAC created a website as a resource for parents or students who need to know the procedures for initiating intervention and the free resources available to them. The website was developed through a cooperative effort with Washtenaw Community College.</p>
      <p>In 1999, Project SOAR was developed and funded to provide educational alternatives to expelled public school students. From SOAR the Washtenaw County Intermediate School District spun off another program, School to Youth: Learning for Unserved Students (STYLUS). Ken Ludwig, SOAR case manager, provided services to more than half of STYLUS participants. After a Board revitalization effort in 2000, SAC made a successful effort to submit and obtain grants for several programs, implemented in 2001: Active Voices of Youth and Raise a Strong Voice for Children. Active Voices of Youth, funded by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation with $32,000, enabled SAC to organize high school student focus groups from schools around Michigan to form planning groups with the purpose of creating positive school climates. Raise a Strong Voice for Youth Legal Advocacy Project, a partnership with the University of Michigan Law School, and funded by the Michigan State Bar Foundation, strengthened SAC personnel with the creation of a staff attorney position and brought legal and social work volunteer professionals into SAC staff.</p>
      <p>Fire destroyed SAC offices February 19, 2002 when an arsonist set fire to the United Way Building where SAC was a tenant. It is important to note that many of the SAC files were destroyed in the fire, so there are many gaps in these records.</p>

          <p>The Administration series contains seven subseries. The Board of Directors subseries includes SAC corporate papers, minutes for 1988-1991 and 1999-2001, strategic plans, and the 2000-2001 Board revitalization process. The Clippings subseries highlight SAC activities in the public eye through the three decades of existence and is a primary source for finding details on SAC activities in Ann Arbor and around the state. Included in this subseries are the contents of a scrapbook of newspaper clippings, damaged by the 2002 fire, documenting the Black History case. This case received national attention and was cited in the <title render="italic">New York Times</title> and other major newspapers. The Office Management subseries contains general information used for the public relations and partial information on fundraising activities. No budgetary information was available in the records as accessioned. The Publications subseries includes the SAC newsletter, "Active Voice" from 1975 to 2002. There is also a copy of "The Fourth 'R', Student Rights, A Handbook for Michigan Public School Students and Their Families," an article entitled "Access Denied," and two relevant articles that appeared in the <title render="italic">Administrative Law Quarterly</title>.</p>

          <p>The Program series contains seven subseries. The Casework subseries includes information on the primary activity SAC: student advocacy casework. There were several large cases involving entire school districts: Baldwin and Fennville which are documented here. In the beginning, SAC dealt mainly with individual student cases. There is information in this series including forms, summaries and statistics. The Lawyers' Committee subseries includes information on its creation, minutes, and a topical subseries. The Expulsion Data Collection Project was one of their major activities. The committee also dealt with zero tolerance and 504 policies, among others. The Volunteer subseries contains two training manuals, written twenty-three years apart, reflecting changes in techniques over the decades. Volunteers were recruited and trained to support the student and involved parents to find a resolution to school problems, often stemming from suspension or expulsion. The Website development subseries includes copies of pages from the site as it was accessed on August 10, 2004 at http://www.studentadvocacycenter.org. The website made available sample letters, forms, Attorney Listserv, and Quick Guides for many different types of appeals to school districts.</p>

          <p>Grants and Fundraising series includes both funded and unfunded applications, as well as other materials related to fundraising and cultivating relations with donors. Researchers should look at the grant applications for summary descriptions of SAC and its activities. The Background subseries includes concepts that SAC used in grant applications and a list of funded grants with descriptions. Grants funded include: SOAR, Community Impact, a pass through grant to the Women's Empowerment Project of Monroe, Active Voices of Youth, and Raise a Strong Voice for Children, submitted and funded from 1999 through 2003. These grants demonstrate that SAC was able to form partnerships with Michigan State University and its Institute for Children, Youth, and Family, the Michigan State Bar Foundation, and others, with the purpose of extending their advocacy services throughout Michigan. Student Opportunities and Alternative Resources (SOAR) subseries includes project evaluations and information about STYLUS that, as an outgrowth of SOAR, continued to function within the Washtenaw County ISD. Active Voice of Youth subseries contains the program for a Youth Leadership Conference in September, 2001. The subseries, Raise a Strong Voice for Children Legal Advocacy Project, includes information on the partnership with the University of Michigan Law School and SAC to create an advocacy agenda to be implemented by a staff attorney and volunteer law students. The Michigan State Bar Foundation funded the first year with an Access to Justice grant to address educational equity issues and then continued a second year of funding. The subseries includes the year end report for 2001-2002 by the Project Director/Staff Attorney, Elsa Shartsis. This report documents the losses incurred by SAC in the February 19, 2002 fire in which SAC lost furnishings, equipment, and most of its files, supplies, and reference books. The report outlines the accomplishments of the Project Director and reflects the increasing professionalism of the SAC staff and volunteers. The 2003 grant application evidences SAC's partnership with the University of Michigan Law School and the Michigan Poverty Law Program. SAC's goal was to build a framework for systematic legal advocacy and an attorney network for low-income students and their families. SAC wanted to push beyond non-legal advocacy.</p>
