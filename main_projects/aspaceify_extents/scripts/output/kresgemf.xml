      <p>A.H. Taylor, Jr., President of the Kresge Foundation, described Stanley Kresge in the Oakland Press on August 8, 1982, "He's one of a vanishing breed. He came through an entrepreneur background. He's close to a self-made man and credits first the Lord, and second his Dad."</p>
      <p>Stanley Kresge was born in Detroit on June 11, 1900, the eldest son of Anna and Sebastian Kresge. His devoutly Christian parents and his own active involvement with the church from an early age led to the development of the moral principles which guided his life. He rose to leadership positions in both the S.S. Kresge Company (later K mart Corporation), and Kresge Foundation, organizations that were established by his father Sebastian.</p>
      <p>Stanley's first experience in the retailing business was in the stockroom of the Kresge store in Detroit during summer vacations. After graduating from Detroit Central High School in 1918, he attended the University of Michigan for three years before transferring to Albion College, where he received his A.B. Degree in 1923. In that same year he began his full-time involvement with his father's growing company. He served as a manager-trainee in the Detroit store at Grand River and Woodward where he learned the business by working in the stockroom, and as a buyer and floor manager. He became assistant manager and later merchandise manager of the store. In 1926, Stanley moved to Flint as assistant manager of the Kresge store, and a year later he was promoted to manager of the new Kresge Dollar Store in Detroit at Grand River and Joy Road.</p>
      <p>In 1930, Stanley joined the headquarters staff of the Kresge Company and for the next twenty years worked in a variety of positions, primarily related to sales promotion. He was appointed to the Board of Directors in 1950, became vice-chairman of the Board in 1953, and succeeded his father as chairman in 1966, shortly before his father died.</p>
      <p>Stanley resigned his position as Kresge chairman in 1967, to become chairman of the Kresge Foundation, a philanthropic organization founded by his father in 1924, of which Stanley had been president since 1952. He was named honorary chairman in 1978 and remained actively involved with the Foundation thereafter.</p>
      <p>In addition to his work with the Kresge Company and the Foundation, Stanley was active in religious, educational, political, and civic organizations. He was a longtime member of the Metropolitan United Methodist Church of Detroit and served as a trustee; he was involved in the affairs of Albion College, where he also was a trustee; he was a board member of the Greater Detroit YMCA; he participated in Detroit Rotary Club events; and he was active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Kresge's hobbies included photography, book collecting, and sports--he had played baseball and football in high school and college, and enjoyed playing tennis for much of his life.</p>
      <p>It was on the tennis courts of the Metropolitan United Methodist Church of Detroit that he met his future wife, Dorothy McVittie, in 1915. They courted for eight years and married in 1923. They maintained two residences, one in Detroit and one in Lake Angelus, but later in life the Kresges made their permanent home in Lake Angelus. They had three sons, fifteen grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren. Stanley Kresge died on June 30, 1985.</p>

      <p>The Stanley Kresge Papers, an important source for the researcher interested in the history of the S.S. Kresge Company/K mart Corporation; the work of the Kresge Foundation; and the Kresge family, have been divided into six series: Kresge Company/K mart Corporation; Kresge Foundation; Organizations; Personal; Speeches; and Visual Materials. The collection has now been microfilmed to allow inter-library access to the collection. These 21 microfilm rolls comprise the bulk of Kresge's collection. Excluded from the microfilming have been a few folders of restricted financial materials, two oversize ledgers, and, of course, the motion picture films. The following finding aid is a guide to the entire collection with appropriate indication of files and other materials not part of the microfilm edition.</p>

          <p>The Kresge Company/K mart Corporation series consists of those materials collected and generated by Stanley during his 43 years of experience in retailing. It measures four linear feet and is arranged alphabetically by topic. There is much that will interest the researcher, including the background files, which contain materials on the history of both S.S. Kresge as well as other retailing firms, and transcripts of conversations between Stanley and several company executives regarding their early experiences with the company and its founder. There are numerous financial reports (including reports for S.S. Kresge Company, Ltd., of Canada, and Mount Clemens Pottery); committee reports; materials relating to company employees, including newsletters and employee relation policies and guidelines; and documents which provide valuable insight into the role of Kresge store managers. Among the latter are convention reports, and "general letters" from the 1930s which were sent from headquarters to store managers to guide them in their day-to-day operations. The contents list for this portion of the Stanley Kresge Papers is quite detailed, to assist the researcher in locating specific materials.</p>

          <p>The Kresge Foundation series is one linear foot, and from it the researcher will learn of the Foundation's specific activities in various fields. The background files provide information on the history of the organization, while the Annual Reports for the years 1924-1973 and Stanley's general files, arranged by decade for the years 1930-1985, trace the Foundation's endowments to specific groups and organizations. The general files contain a variety of materials including financial statements, trustee memos, and minutes from meetings. The minutes are helpful in learning what the trustees did and how they worked, but shed little light on why applications for grants were accepted or rejected. Access to grant applications is restricted.</p>

          <p>The Organizations series is two linear feet and arranged alphabetically by organization name. These are almost all organizations to which Stanley contributed time or money. This series reveals the breadth of Kresge's interests in and depth of commitment to religious and educational organizations and institutions, and of the friendships that arose from his interests, including those with the Reverend Billy Graham and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. The researcher will also find materials which assist in documenting his contributions to the state and national Republican party.</p>

          <p>The Personal series measures three and one-half linear feet, is arranged topically, and provides the greatest amount of information on Kresge family members. The background files will assist the researcher in detailing Stanley's corporate career and involvement with outside organizations. The bulk of the series is comprised of "correspondence," arranged by month and year, between Stanley and family members and friends. In the correspondence with family members, the most important is that with his mother, Anna Kresge; his wife, Dorothy; and his father, Sebastian. There is little material available on Anna Kresge, who was an important influence on Stanley as he grew up. The personal nature of the correspondence between mother and son is valuable in documenting their close relationship. From the correspondence with Dorothy (incoming only) one learns a good deal about the couple's personalities and their strong marriage. Finally, the correspondence with Sebastian not only assists in understanding their father-son relationship, but it is also important for the researcher interested in Kresge/K mart history. Quite often in their letters to one another, they would comment on important business developments.</p>
          <p>The correspondence with friends acquaints the researcher with many of Stanley and Dorothy's life-long friends. Because of their wide circle of friends and many activities, the Kresges could not correspond as frequently as they desired. Their letters, therefore, are often summaries of their activities and can provide the researcher with an overview of their more important personal and civic activities.</p>
          <p>The "religious organizations" sequence of the Personal series primarily documents Stanley's involvement with the Metropolitan United Methodist Church in Detroit. There are organizational materials on one of the largest Methodist churches in the country, and particularly interesting documents on Stanley's work with the Pastoral Relations Committee and its efforts to secure a new pastor for the church in 1943, when it sought Norman Vincent Peale, and in 1961. In 1943, Stanley's efforts included writing letters to Kresge managers in towns in which prospective candidates preached, requesting general information, and for 1961, there is a revealing memo from Stanley to other committee members describing his trip to meet one of the candidates.</p>
