    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Percival C. Lowery was born on March 26, 1885 in Harbor Beach, Michigan. Graduating in 1910 from the University of Michigan College of Dental Surgery with a D.D.S., he began his practice in Detroit. On June 29, 1912, he married Myrtle Anne King of Detroit. They had one daughter, Marie Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>Lowery studied at the university in a time when the dental school was transitioning from teaching only dental technique to a more research-oriented approach to dentistry. His career reflected this shift. Lowery avidly pursued improvements in the use of new materials and new techniques and shared his research and practice with his colleagues. Lowery was an expert in the field of maxillofacial prosthodontics and dental esthetics. During World War I, Lowery served as a member of the 32nd war board of Detroit and chief of dental service attached to the U.S. Army Hospital no. 36, achieving the rank of major.</p>
      <p>He served as a lecturer at the University of Michigan Dental School from 1921 to 1924. From 1924 to 1929 he was professor of prosthetic dentistry at the university. The University of Michigan conferred an honorary Master of Science degree upon him in 1940.</p>
      <p>He was recognized by the Pierre Fauchard Academy in 1953 for distinguished service to the profession and selected American Dentist of the Year. In addition to the Fauchard Academy, which he led in 1952, Lowery was a member of the American Academy of Denture Prosthetics, the American Dental Association, the Federation Dentaire Internationale, and the International College of Dentists--U.S.A. Section. Lowery also was a member of and served as president of the Michigan Dental Society in 1929.</p>
      <p>He died in Detroit on June 17, 1978, at the age of 93 after more than sixty years in the dental profession. He was inducted into the University of Michigan School of Dentistry Hall of Fame in 2003.</p>

          <p>The bulk of the collection is the Professional and Personal Organizations series (.5 linear feet, 1926-1960). This series includes correspondence, directories, histories, minutes, proceedings, and reports from professional organizations in which Lowery was active. The best documented are the American Dental Association (ADA) and its War Service Committee. These files describe the problems of insuring that enough dentists were available for servicemen in war service and civilians at home, and that equipment and supplies were on hand for both groups. Lowery was also active in the ADA Research Commission serving on the Advisory Committee on Research in Dental Caries and the Executive Committee. The Pierre Fauchard Academy files include information about his presidency in 1952 and letters of congratulations when he won the Fauchard Award as the outstanding dentist in the United States in 1953.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan School of Dentistry series (6 folders, 1930-1960) documents Lowery's activities on the 1910 Dental School Reunion Committee. It contains some alumni questionnaires from his classmates as well as class directories and correspondence. Researchers will also find correspondence between University of Michigan President Alexander Ruthven and Lowery regarding the perception of waning alumni support for the School of Dentistry.</p>
