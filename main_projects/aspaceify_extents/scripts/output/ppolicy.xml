      <p>In 1914, the Department of Political Science established a graduate program which led to a master's degree in municipal administration. Courses were taken from the curricula of various departments, schools and colleges including Economics, Landscape Design, the Law School, and the College of Engineering. By the mid 1930s, a demand had developed for individuals trained to perform various administrative functions in Michigan. In 1936, the Institute of Social and Public Administration was established as part of the graduate school at the university to address this need. A program was developed to satisfy demands for trained administrators who could work in the fields of public administration, land utilization, and social work. In 1938, the Bureau of Government, a center for research on municipal administration, became part of the University Institute of Public and Social Administration.</p>
      <p>The Regents of the University of Michigan approved a plan for the establishment of the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) on September 28, 1945. A formal announcement of the formation of the new institute was issued in March 1946. The new program had several goals. They included training students in the field of public administration as well as conducting research on matters of public interest such as taxes, employment, etc. Offering services to public officials and legislative bodies was also identified as one of the goals of the program. Finally, the program would cooperate with government offices to offer "in-service training" to advanced students, as well as to offer short courses to public employees. Instruction and research in the fields of law, engineering, public health, and economics, among others, were integrated into the program.</p>
      <p>In 1949, the IPA participated in the first of a series of international programs about public policy and administration issues. The IPA was one of six American universities to host Germans who were instructed in American social/political institutions and democratic skills, as well as other subjects. The second international project in which the Institute of Public Administration was involved in the1950s was the establishment of the Institute of Public Administration at the University of the Philippines in 1952. The goal of this project was to train Filipinos for work in public administration and help Philippine government employees improve their effectiveness. The Institute was staffed by professors from the University of Michigan, although over time they were replaced by instructors from the Philippine University. During the 1960s, the Institute worked on another international project entitled the Taiwan Center for Public and Business Administration. The Taiwan Center was a joint effort by the government of the Republic of China, the University of Michigan, and the Agency for International Aid. The Center offered an undergraduate degree in public and business administration, as well as an in-service training program. In addition to the in-service and undergraduate degree programs, the Taiwan Center also developed the <title render="italic">Chinese Journal of Administration</title>, held seminars for Taiwan's government officials, and sent faculty from Taiwan to the United States for advanced training.</p>
      <p>In 1968, the Institute of Public Policy Studies (IPPS) was formed. The new program synthesized the offerings of the Institute of Public Administration with courses in economic analysis, quantitative methods, and other subjects. It was one of the first graduate programs in public policy in the United States. The program at the University of Michigan was modeled on an interdisciplinary approach to public policy issues that used the techniques and tools of the social sciences to address social problems. Links with the schools of Law, Business, Natural Resources, and Public Health allowed the program to expand the areas of expertise that were offered. The mission of IPPS was to research public policy issues and train students for careers in public services. It also recognized the absence of a program in which public officials could enhance and renew their skills. A series of policy seminars for public officials was established to address this need. Over the time of its existence, IPPS also played a leading role in the development of an international curriculum in public policy studies.</p>
      <p>In 1995, IPPS was established as an independent school within the University of Michigan and was subsequently designated as the School of Public Policy.</p>
      <p>In 1999, the School of Public Policy was re-named the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy in honor of the 38th President of the United States, Gerald R. Ford, who graduated from the University of Michigan in 1935. Since 2001, the school has offered joint doctoral programs with the departments of economics, political science, and sociology. The school began construction of a new home, Joan and Sanford Weil Hall, in the fall of 2004 and dedicated the building in the fall of 2006.</p>

      <p>The University of Michigan Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy record group documents the history and development of public policy studies at the University of Michigan. The records contain some information on the beginning of instruction in public administration in 1915 and the formation of the Institute of Social and Public Administration in 1936. The bulk of the material documents the administration and subsequent reorganizations of the academic unit currently known as the School of Public Policy. Records include correspondence, minutes, historical materials and topical files concerning the Institute, its Lansing Office, its programs in the Republic of China and documented the Philippine Islands, and the Michigan Constitutional Convention of 1961- 1962. the records have been received in three major accessions, 1972 (boxed 1-9), 1997 (boxes 10-14) and 2006 (boxes 15-18).</p>
      <p>Most of the materials comprising the 1972 accession cover the period from the 1950s to the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, few documents about the establishment and development of the public policy studies curriculum between 1915 and 1945 exist. Particular strengths of the record group are the materials on the Philippine Institute of Public Administration and the Taiwan Center for Public and Business Administration Education. The German Training Program files also offer insight into international interests of the public administration faculty at the University of Michigan. The German Training Program was a program established to provide Germans with a knowledge of American political and social institutions, democratic skills, and development of individual competence in fields of knowledge such as journalism, pedagogy, and public administration. Other series in the School of Public Policy records allow for a general overview of the structure of the School of Public Policy. They also demonstrate the composition and research interests of the faculty and students in the department.</p>
      <p>The records comprising the 1997 accession from the School of Public Policy were primarily arranged chronologically. This arrangement has been retained and the record group has been broken down into a Chronological Files series, several Topical Files series, a Sound Recordings Series, and a Photographs series. It should be noted that some of the files in the Topical Files series include documents created after the dates noted in the series heading.</p>
      <p>The 2006 accession consisted of additional administrative files and material relating to the dedication of the Joan and Sanford Weil Hall groundbreaking and dedication.</p>

          <p>The John W. Lederle series (.5 linear feet) primarily contains correspondence to and from John W. Lederle during his tenure as director of the Institute of Public Administration. It covers the period between 1952 and 1960. Lederle's correspondence includes both general information about the day-to-day management of the Institute, as well as information specific to the development of the Institute. Lederle corresponded with individuals involved in creating/developing public policy programs at other institutions around the country. These letters partially illustrate the development of this area of study at various universities.</p>

          <p>The Philippine Institute of Public Administration Project series (3 linear feet) offers insight into the development of a regional training center for public administration at the University of the Philippines in 1952. The records were created between 1952 and 1957, and include budget materials, correspondence, publicity materials, and other general information. The Reports and the Semi-Annual Reports subseries are especially rich as they include detailed information about projects and the development of the Philippine Institute.</p>

          <p>The Chronological Files series (1 linear foot) contains documentation of the Institute of Public Policy Studies between the years 1973 and 1983. The series is mainly comprised of correspondence, however, applications for grants, memoranda to the faculty from the director, announcements for brown bags, among other items are also located here. Since few topical files for the years spanned by the Chronological Files series are held by the Bentley, the materials in the Chronological Files series offer valuable information about this period.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series (3.5 linear feet) includes records arranged topically by year from 1981 through 1993, except for a group of records which were unordered when they were received and spanned several years. These comprise the 1966-1980 subseries. This subseries contains limited information about the administrative and research activities of the Institute. Files which include exceptional information are the Ann Arbor Political History and the Kidney Problem files. Both of these files include information about faculty research at the Institute of Public Policy Studies. The remaining subseries include information pertaining to the daily activities of the Institute for Public Policy Studies. These include documents about the Institute's curriculum, demographics of its students, visitors, and activities. Files which contain information about the administrative activities at the Institute include the Faculty Memos from the Director files, Executive Committee files, the Student Affairs files, and the Visitors files. They allow for a broad overview of how the Institute of Public Policy Studies developed between 1981 and 1993. More detailed information about topics of particular interest at the Institute is offered by the Brown Bags and Lectures files and the European Growth Project.</p>

          <p>The Joan and Sanford Weil Hall Groundbreaking and Dedication Series (.5 linear feet) contains the contents of two binders received by the library documenting the groundbreaking ceremony (November 12th, 2004) and dedication ceremony (October 13th, 2006) of the school's new home. Logistics, those invited and attending, speeches delivered, and the publicity and media coverage are well documented for both events. President Gerald R. Ford and family were in attendance at the groundbreaking ceremony. Speeches delivered at the event include an address by University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman expressing gratitude for Gerald R. Ford's contributions to the University and the beneficence of Joan and Sanford Weil. President Ford also made some remarks regarding his memories of his undergraduate experience at the University of Michigan and the pioneering work undertaken at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. There are a number of photographs in each of the subseries that have been retained in loco to preserve the context of the visual information.</p>

          <p>The Archived Website series (2002-2008, 3.78 GB; 2010-[ONGOING]) documents the academic programs, accomplishments, resources, events, and people at the Ford School of Public Policy as presented on its public website. Content includes important news and announcements, publications including newsletters, course catalogs, and working papers, and information about admissions, curriculum, degree requirements, student life, faculty, and the overall mission of the School. The series is arranged chronologically and includes content captured by the Internet Archive starting in 1997 as well as captures provided by Bentley Library archivists in 2002, 2003, 2006, and 2008. Starting in 2010, this archived website will be captured on a regular, ongoing basis as part of the University of Michigan Web Archives, hosted at http://webarchives.cdlib.org/a/universityofmichigan/.</p>
