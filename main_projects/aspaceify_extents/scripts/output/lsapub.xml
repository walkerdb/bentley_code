          <p>The Unit Publications series contains printed material published specifically by the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. These publications are defined as being widely distributed and may be published at regular intervals. They are arranged by genre of the publication.</p>
          <p>The Unit Publications series (8.4 linear feet) includes addresses, annual reports, bibliographies, brochures, bulletins (course catalogs), by-laws, calendars, catalogs, directories, manuals, newsletters, proceedings, programs, regulations, and reports.</p>
          <p>The annual reports cover the period from 1933 to 1998, with the bulk documenting the period from 1977 to 1998. They briefly describe the activities of the college and list donors to the college's programs. (For earlier annual reports the researcher should consult the <title render="italic">President's Report</title> (call no. Fimu, B3), published from 1853 to 1984). The brochures describe some of the special offerings of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts including collegiate seminars, first year seminars, special foreign language offerings, general studies, and various theme semesters. These brochures cover the period from the 1980s through 1990.</p>
          <p>The bulletins or college catalogs (2.4 linear feet) describe the admissions requirements, course offerings (but not descriptions), degree requirements, facilities, and history of the college. The print version of the bulletin, from 1871 to the present is the authoritative source of admissions information, course offerings, and degree requirements. Under the heading "catalogs" the researcher will find about 1 linear foot of course descriptions under the titles <title render="italic">LSA Course Guide</title> documenting the period from 1976 to 1998, and the <title render="italic">LS&amp;A Brief Course Guide</title> covering the period from 2001 to 2002. These titles also contain information about prerequisites.</p>
          <p>In the manuals subseries there are handbooks for first year students, covering the period from 1988 to the present. These volumes include an alphabetical listing, by department, of detailed course descriptions, even noting differences between the various sections offered. Distribution information (Social Sciences, Humanities, etc.), prerequisites, credits, and instructors are also identified. These handbooks also contain information about LS&amp;A degree requirements, a directory of academic advising and counseling services, advice on distribution requirements, selecting an advisor, concentration course information, in addition to book costs, and special fees associated with the course. The are found under various titles such as the:</p>
          <p><title render="italic">Freshman Course Guide</title>, 1988</p>
          <p><title render="italic">First Year Handbook and Freshman Fall Course Guide</title>, 1988-1994</p>
          <p><title render="italic">First Year Handbook</title>, 1994 to the present</p>
          <p>In 1997 the course information was broken out of the <title render="italic">First Year Handbook</title> into a separate publication entitled the <title render="italic">First Year Course Guide</title>. This publications continues to be published to the present.</p>
          <p>In this subseries researchers will also find handbooks for the faculty, international students, parents, and transfer students. The <title render="italic">Handbook for LSA Instructional Staff</title> was compiled in 1981 from the Faculty Code, the governing document created by the LS&amp;A faculty. The <title render="italic">Information and Regulations Governing the Conduct of Undergraduate Courses</title>, published in 1962 and 1967, was to provide the teaching staff with a readily accessible list of the policies and procedures governing the conduct of LS&amp;A courses. The <title render="italic">International Student Handbook</title> published from 1998 to the present contains information to help ease the transition for incoming, non-American students. There is information on LS&amp;A advising resources, academic resources, learning communities, academic conduct, international student associations, and helpful hints for living far from home for the first time. The <title render="italic">Parent Handbook</title> includes similar information with hints for how parents can help their student succeed at the University of Michigan. The library holds this publication from 1997 to 2002. In later years this publication became the <title render="italic">LSA Guide for Parents</title> and is available as well in the sub series. The <title render="italic">Transfer Student Handbook</title>, dating from 1989 to the present, discusses LS&amp;A advising, but concentrates on the transfer of credits from other academic institutions and planning for the students' academic career at Michigan.</p>
          <p>The <title render="italic">LSA Distribution Book</title>, in conjunction with the <title render="italic">Bulletin</title>, is designed to help students select courses outside of their concentration area in the categories of Humanities, Natural Science, and Social Sciences. By selecting courses not in their concentration or cognate fields they are broadening their intellectual horizons and interests, which is a goal of a University of Michigan education. The <title render="italic">LSA Distribution Book</title> lists various courses, arranged alphabetically by department, with brief descriptions and explains how these courses can be used to fulfill distribution requirements. The library holds this publication from 1989 to 1992.</p>
          <p>The subseries newsletters contains several titles including <title render="italic">Diagonalia</title>, <title render="italic">LSA Checkpoint</title>, <title render="italic">LSA Magazine</title>, and the <title render="italic">LSA Student Academic Affairs Newsletter</title>. The <title render="italic">Diagonalia</title>, published from 1971 to 1975, provides much information about what was going on in the dean's office and the various departments in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. It describes new courses being offered, programs being developed, and long-range planning. There are also articles by faculty members on topics such as creativity or liberal arts education. The <title render="italic">LSA Checkpoint</title> published from 1974 to 1996, and its successor <title render="italic">LSA Student Academic Affairs Newsletter</title> issued from 1996 to 1998, were originally published monthly during the academic year and later three to four times a year. These newsletters discuss summer orientation, registration, new courses, mini-courses, graduation and counseling information. The library does not hold a complete run of these publication. The <title render="italic">LSA Magazine</title>, dating from 1977 to the present, documents the activities of the various administrators, faculty, staff, students, and alumni of the college. Currently published twice a year, the Bentley Library holds a nearly complete run of this publication.</p>
          <p>There are three small commencement programs, from 1992 through 1994, included in this series. A better source for commencement information, including lists of graduates, will be found in the University of Michigan. Chief Marshall records (call no. 8753, Bimu, E3, 2), documenting the period from 1914 to the present.</p>

          <p>The Sub-Unit Publications series contains publications from subordinate offices, departments, programs, and organizations within the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. These publications are arranged alphabetically by the creating sub-unit.</p>
          <p>The Sub-Unit Publications series (2.4 linear feet) includes publications produced by the Academic Advising Center and the Academic Counseling Office, Committee on the Underclass/ Undergraduate Experience, the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, First Year Seminar Program, the Honors Program, and Office of Student Academic Affairs.</p>
          <p>The Academic Advising Center includes proceedings and reports from 1998 to 2001 that discuss and provide information regarding changes and initiatives within the college and the curriculum. In these publications the researcher will find discussions about technology, efforts to engage sophomores, information about specific disciplines from astronomy to romance languages. Researchers will also find manuals for concentration advisors for the period from 1991 to 1994 and for faculty counselors from 1977-1978. The Office of Student Academic Affairs publications include several manuals for academic faculty advisors for the 1990s. There is also a <title render="italic">Summer Orientation Handbook</title> published from 1991 to 1997, as well as annual reports for this office issued from 1980 to 1994.</p>
          <p>In the early 1970s there was concern that the University of Michigan was not providing a balanced program for its undergraduates. In 1972 a report from the Committee on the Underclass Experience was issued. In 1990, a report entitled <title render="italic">A Michigan Education: The Challenges of Undergraduate Education at the University of Michigan</title>, was published by the Committee on the Undergraduate Experience. This report is included with the other publications of the committee. There are also reports regarding counseling and pedagogy. These reports spurred the development of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP). Included in the publications of this sub-unit are undated brochures and a 1992 directory describing research projects, the faculty supervisors, and the participating students. The First Year Seminar was developed to give first-year students an opportunity to have a small class experience. The First Year Seminar Program catalogs, covering the period from 1994 to the present, list the First Year Seminar courses with a brief description, the faculty member leading the class, credit hours, and day and time the course is offered. They are arranged first by LSA general requirements (Introductory Composition, Race and Ethnicity, Quantitative Reasoning, Humanities, Natural Science, and Social Science) then alphabetically by department or center.</p>
          <p>The Honors Program publications include annual reports from 1958 to 1976. There is a 1989 directory describing research opportunities for undergraduate honors. The <title render="italic">Honors Handbook</title> describes the admission process into the Honors Program, thesis policies, academic policies and procedures related to the Honors Program, research programs, and scholarship programs. There is also a series of newsletters entitled <title render="italic">Honorabilia</title> covering the period from 1979 to 1993. These newsletters describe new Honors courses, job opportunities for honors students, thesis information, and new faculty.</p>

          <p>The Student Publications series (.2 linear feet) contains publications published by student groups within the College of Literature, Science and the Arts and document the activities and concerns of students during their time at the University of Michigan.</p>
          <p>The Student Publications series includes brochures, journals, manuals, newsletters, and reports published by and about the LSA Student Government. The journal <title render="italic">Player</title> was published in the 1997-1998 academic year. It is an anthology of writings by students from the college. There are two manuals, <title render="italic">Disorientation</title> released from 1973 to 1976, and the undated <title render="italic">Michigopoly</title> published to help familiarize new students to Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan, and the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. In the 1980s there were three newsletters published by LSA Student Government to inform LSA students of the activities of student government in the college. These included the <title render="italic">LSA News</title> issued in 1984, the <title render="italic">LSA-SG News</title> printed in 1985 and the <title render="italic">LSA Journal</title> published in 1985 and 1988. There are also two reports describing the activities of LSA Student Government in 1997 and 1999 including vision and mission statements, student officers and representatives, committee activity reports, survey results, and copies of <title render="italic">Michigan Daily</title> articles about LSA Student Government.</p>
