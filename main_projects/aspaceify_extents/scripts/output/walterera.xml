    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Erich A. Walter was born in Zanesville, Ohio on July 5, 1897. Despite his early roots in Ohio, Walter was a graduate of the Ann Arbor High School class of 1915. After his graduation, Walter received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Michigan's Literary College in 1919 and immediately joined the faculty as an instructor in rhetoric. He earned his Master of Arts degree in 1921, also from the University of Michigan. Shortly after, in 1922, Walter married Meta Henne, a 1919 graduate of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan, with whom he had three children. Furthermore, he studied at the British Museum, London, England, for a time in 1930 and 1931 and in 1937 and 1938. In 1955, Walter served as the University's delegate to the Installation of H. M. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, as Chancellor of the University of London.</p>
      <p>Walter's career at the University of Michigan was marked by a series of promotions throughout his 53 year relationship with the school. In 1923, Walter was promoted to assistant professor of English and was made chairman of the Freshman English Program in 1927. He was promoted to associate professor in 1935, while also taking on the new role of chairman of Academic Counselors. Then, in 1938 he was made Assistant Dean of the Literary College, and later Associate Dean in 1945. In 1947, Walter was given a full professorship at the university and was appointed Director of the Office of Student Affairs, a title which was changed to Dean of Students in 1948. He remained in this role until his appointment in 1953 as Assistant to the President, who at this time was President Harlan Hatcher. Five years later, in 1958, he was also appointed secretary of the Regents. Walter retired from the University in 1967, at the age of 70, upon which he was appointed Assistant Emeritus to the President, Secretary Emeritus of the University, and Professor Emeritus of English.</p>
      <p>In addition to these roles, Walter was chairman of the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project in 1946 and 1947. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Ann Arbor Public Schools from 1933 to 1939, serving as president during his last year on the board. From 1946 to 1953, he was a member of the Board of Directors of Cranbrook School for Boys, Bloomfield Hills, Mich., filling the role of secretary in 1949. From 1949 to 1955, he was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Ann Arbor Chamber of Commerce. Walter was a member of the Modern Language Association, National Council of Teachers of English, Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters, American Association of University Professors, English Speaking Union, Michigan College Association, Quadrangle Club, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma Rho Tau, and was decorated Star of Italian Solidarity, Second Class, in 1962.</p>
      <p>Walter served as the editor for numerous publications: <title render="italic">University Readings</title> (with C.D. Thorpe) in 1931; <title render="italic">Bibliography of Contemporary Literature</title>, 1932-1937 (English Journal); <title render="italic">Essay Annual</title> (yearly volumes), 1933-1941; <title render="italic">Toward Today</title>, 1938; and <title render="italic">Religion and the State University</title> 1958. He also co-authored <title render="italic">A Pictorial History of the Great Lakes</title> with Harlan Hatcher in 1963. Erich Walter died on April 1, 1977 in South Bend, Indiana, at the age of 79.</p>

          <p>The Editorial papers series (2.1 linear feet, 1933-1949) consists of the materials relating to two of Walter's editorial ventures, the <title render="italic">Essay Annual</title> volumes from 1933-1941, and <title render="italic">Toward Today</title>. There are two subseries within this series, one relating to <title render="italic">Essay Annual</title> and the other relating to Toward Today. The papers included are papers relating to the administrative duties of editorship (including correspondence with authors, of whom E.B. White, James Thurber, and John Steinbeck are among), biographical notices, essays included in the volumes, or, in <title render="italic">Toward Today</title>'s case, excerpts from the volume, permissions, reports and reviews of the volumes, and letters of regret to authors whose writings were not used, and statements of sales.</p>

        <p>Outside of this collection, Erich Walter has a photograph collection and a sound recordings collection, both located at the Bentley Historical Library, that are unrelated but possibly of interest. This collection is of value to those interested on the history of the University of Michigan, the history of the Great Lakes region, and those interested in an in-depth look into editorial work, especially when dealing with authors, and dealing with the ins-and-outs of copyright and publishing. The collection is divided into two series: the University papers series and the Editorial papers series.</p>
