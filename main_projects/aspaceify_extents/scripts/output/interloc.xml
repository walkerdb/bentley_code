    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Joseph Maddy, Interlochen's founder and long-time leader, was born in Wellington, Kansas, on October 21, 1891. Both his parents were educators. His father taught before becoming a banker, and his mother served as county school superintendent. Both also enjoyed performing music, especially his mother, an accomplished amateur musician. Their first son, Harry, a year and a half older, served as a role model in Joe's early musical career.</p>
      <p>As youths, the two brothers joined the newly formed Wellington Boys Band. Its director took the group on a musical camping trip, which Joe greatly enjoyed. Later, the boys graduated to the town band. They also performed in the family quartet, which was expanded during their early teens when another talented musical family, the Petits, moved to town. The Petits' youngest daughter, Fay, who years later eventually became Mrs. Joseph Maddy, and the two families spent part of a summer playing music while camping together.</p>
      <p>Since musical instruction was unavailable in the public schools, Joe Maddy, like his brother before him, dropped out of high school after his freshman year. Following two semesters at Bethany (Kansas) College of Music and Fine Arts, he transferred to the Wichita (Kansas) College of Music, which his brother attended. In 1909, having joined the musicians union, he again followed his brother, becoming the youngest member of the Minneapolis Symphony. Two years later, he married Marie Mangan, and in 1913, the first of their three children was born.</p>
      <p>While his brother remained for almost a half century as violinist with the Minneapolis Symphony, Joe, a violist, chaffed under the group's emphasis on seniority, rather than ability, for promotion. So in 1914, he switched to the new St. Paul Orchestra as Assistant Concertmaster.</p>
      <p>The economic disruptions of World War I brought a quick end to the St. Paul Orchestra and Maddy's symphonic career, leading him eventually into music education. For the next four years, he expanded his knowledge and skills in a variety of musical jobs. He became a clarinetist with a vaudeville orchestra in Peoria, Illinois. Then, he learned conducting as head of the orchestra in his native Wellington (Kansas). In 1915, he moved to Wichita Falls, Texas, as director of the College of Music and Art. There, he started a non-credit orchestra among high school students. Relocating to Chicago, he played saxophone in jazz clubs and taught in several music schools.</p>
      <p>In 1918, when philanthropist George Eastman created the position of superintendent of music in the Rochester, New York, public schools, Joe, because of his ability to play a variety of instruments, got the job. Although he lacked the required teaching certificate, the president of the University of Rochester, following a half hour interview, conferred the needed credential on him "by examination." During his two year tenure in Rochester, Maddy started school bands and orchestras which greatly impressed Eastman. Joe's efforts together with a follow-up survey by Pittsburgh music educator, Will Earhart, helped convince Eastman to endow the distinguished music school which bears his name.</p>
      <p>While preparing the Rochester survey, Earhart approached Maddy about becoming supervisor of school music and director of civic music in Richmond, Indiana, a position which Earhart once held. Maddy hesitated because the job included choral work, but Earhart persuaded him that a summer course at Chautauqua under T. P. Giddings, a specialist in mass choral instruction (and head of the public school music program in Minneapolis), would qualify him.</p>
      <p>The Chautauqua experience (1920) forged a strong bond between Maddy and Giddings. Almost immediately, they began collaborating on a master work of music instruction. Shunned initially by publishers because it contained familiar, and thus works which could not be copyrighted, it found a champion in Carl D. Greenleaf, head of C. G. Conn Company, the instrument manufacturer. Published initially by Conn in 1922, the <title render="italic">Universal Teacher</title> became the standard in the field, presenting the first practical system for teaching all instruments of the band and orchestra at the same time.</p>
      <p>During Maddy's four years in Richmond, he scored a major breakthrough by getting music accepted into the regular school curriculum with credit toward graduation. He also developed the first complete high school symphony orchestra, which, in 1922, performed before the Music Supervisors (soon renamed Educators) National Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. In preparing for the trip, Maddy initiated another major reform. Remembering his frustration with the Minneapolis Symphony, he instituted weekly challenges for position determined by the votes of orchestra members. Following four months of intensive study, Maddy passed the subject examinations for a high school diploma, and he also began teaching part-time at Earlham College in Richmond.</p>
      <p>In 1924, Maddy accepted a joint appointment as supervisor of music in the Ann Arbor, Michigan, public schools and head of the school music department in the University School of Music, which was affiliated with but separate from the University of Michigan. At first, he devoted most of his energies to developing the public school music program, organizing the high school band and other musical groups (where, previously, there had been only a mandolin club). By the fall of 1927, he switched totally to the conservatory, where he initiated the first conducting classes.</p>
      <p>A few months before moving to Ann Arbor (1924), Maddy was named a member of the new Instrumental Affairs Committee of the Music Supervisors National Conference. The committee, with gifts from the National Bureau for the Advancement of Music, headed by C. M. Tremaine, funded band and orchestra contests on both the state and national levels. In 1926, Maddy became its chairman, and with assistance from Giddings, organized the first National High School Symphony Orchestra, composed of outstanding young musicians from throughout America. Its performance at the Music Supervisors National Conference in Detroit led to an invitation to assemble a similar group for the national convention of school superintendents in Dallas, Texas, the following spring.</p>
      <p>The performance of the second National High School Orchestra (1927) led the superintendents to adopt a resolution that music receive "equal consideration and support with other basic subjects" in the public schools. An elated Joe Maddy, at a farewell party for orchestra members, promised to find them a permanent home, a summer camp where they could play music "all day long."</p>
      <p>Returning to Ann Arbor, he placed an advertisement in the Sunday <title render="italic">Detroit Free Press</title> seeking a location for his proposed camp. Willis Pennington, owner of a resort hotel near Interlochen in northern Michigan, responded. He had vacant property close to a railroad station and to separate boys and girls camps owned by his family. After an inspection trip, Maddy and Giddings arranged a deal to board campers at the hotel in exchange for some land between the lakes. Tremaine, who served as their financial advisor, finalized the agreement in his office.</p>
      <p>With a loan from band instrument manufacturers plus a personal gift from Greenleaf and additional funds from Traverse City bankers, construction of the camp began. It opened on schedule, June 24, 1928, as the home of the National High School Orchestra. Representing a pioneering venture in both musical and coeducational camping, it became the first truly independent, non-college, summer camp devoted strictly to music and probably the first to incorporate male and female campers on an equal basis. From the beginning, it also accepted members of all religions, rather than following the exclusionary practices of the time. While a strong Southern constituency delayed admission of African Americans, it became a leader in the post World War II integration of private camps, producing many distinguished black alumni, including Jessye Norman.</p>
      <p>The first year of the National High School Orchestra Camp proved an artistic success, but a financial disaster. Ending $40,000 in the red, Maddy sold debenture bonds among supporters and area residents to meet the deficit. To protect the creditors, a Board of Control was formed to oversee the Camp's finances. It consisted of Maddy, Giddings, and Tremaine plus four creditor representatives (Pennington and three debenture holders).</p>
      <p>When the Camp opened for its second year, it added an alumni or college division and featured band as well as orchestra training. Shortly thereafter, with the Depression effectively ending funds for the National High School Orchestra, the Camp began to advertise itself simply as "The National Music Camp."</p>
      <p>Despite a doubling of enrollment in its second year, the deficit remained and became more of a problem with the onset of the Depression. The sale of nationwide broadcast rights in 1930 helped keep the Camp open. Two years later, Maddy secured enough in gifts and new debentures to make a down payment on purchasing the Camp, but within another year, it faced immanent bankruptcy. Tremaine, the treasurer, saved the Camp by persuading Pennington and the debenture holders to accept a reduction in their payments and by instituting rigid financial controls on Maddy's spending.</p>
      <p>Although the Camp struggled financially, it continued to gain fame musically. In 1930, its orchestra performed in Washington, D.C., before President Herbert Hoover with Senator Arthur Vandenberg's daughter as soloist. Three years later, it played at the Century of Progress in Chicago. In 1937, an affiliation with Illinois State Normal University guaranteed college credit to members of its alumni division, and two years later, its orchestra appeared at the World's Fair in New York, conducted by nine year old child protégé, Loren Maazel. Early campers included Frederick Fennell and Seymour Lipkin, and guest artists and faculty: John Philip Sousa, Frederick Stock, Ferde Grofe, Percy Grainger, and Howard Hanson.</p>
      <p>Despite Maddy's success, his preoccupation with the Camp created problems at the University School of Music where he taught. Although the School became a unit of the University of Michigan in 1929, it remained at first under the control of the University Musical Society. Charles A. Sink, head of the Society, grew increasingly critical of the time Maddy devoted to the Camp, rather than the School.</p>
      <p>In 1930, the newly installed president of the University, Alexander Grant Ruthven, came to Maddy's rescue. Using funds from a Carnegie Foundation grant, he released Maddy from teaching for five years with instructions to promote music education as he saw fit.</p>
      <p>Following Ruthven's mandate, Maddy experimented with the use of radio for music instruction. In 1931, under the aegis of the U. of M. Broadcasting Service, he started band and orchestra classes over a statewide network via WJR in Detroit. Eventually, they were expanded to include string and vocal instruction and a popular hymn program. In 1936, NBC picked up his band and orchestra classes on its national network. In Maddy's radio work, he relied heavily on University of Michigan students. They included announcers Mike Wallace (Myron Wallach) for the instructional and Camp broadcasts and Ward Quaal for the hymn program and technician Jerome Wiesner (later president of MIT), who also helped found the radio workshop at the Camp.</p>
      <p>The same year (1936) as Maddy began his national broadcasts, he assumed the presidency of the Music Educators National Conference (MENC). Not surprisingly, educational broadcasting served as the theme of his inaugural address. Upon completion of his two-year term, he became director (1938-1940) of the MENC program, "Music and American Youth," which featured broadcasts of school music groups throughout the United States.</p>
      <p>In addition to his radio work, Maddy, under the sponsorship of the university Extension Service, served as conductor for all-state, regional, and national high school orchestras and supervised state and national school band and orchestra contests and festivals. Often, he arranged his appearances in conjunction with his broadcasts, and everywhere he recruited students for the Camp.</p>
      <p>Despite the successes, Maddy and the Camp experienced a series of crises at the end of the 1930's. Maddy's first marriage disintegrated, and he and Giddings battled over control of Interlochen. Meanwhile, Camp finances remained tight, and the expiration of Maddy's Carnegie grant at the university brought him into renewed conflict with the head of the University Musical Society. Finally, in 1939, NBC, given the growing commercial demand for air time, canceled his nationwide instructional program.</p>
      <p>In 1937, Maddy divorced his first wife, Marie, who served as Interlochen's secretary. His remarriage a year later to his childhood friend, Fay Petit, a professional musician, restored happiness to his personal life, but the problem with Giddings remained.</p>
      <p>Facing imminent retirement from the Minneapolis school system, Giddings opposed Maddy over the choice of Camp director and university affiliation. In order to force a settlement, Tremaine, who supported Maddy, threatened to resign. The tactic worked; the crisis passed, and amiable relations were restored (lasting until Giddings' death in 1954). Thereafter, Maddy, though occasionally restrained in fiscal policy by Tremaine and the Board of Trustees, lacked a serious rival in operating the Camp.</p>
      <p>The easing of the Depression and a Hollywood movie contract, resulting in Paramount Pictures <title render="italic">There's Magic in Music</title> (1940), finally brought prosperity to the Camp. At the end of the 1941 season, Pennington exchanged the deed to the property for a mortgage on the amount due. Two years later, the mortgage was retired, and in another year, the debentures paid. The Camp also expanded, purchasing Camp Penn Loch (the new Junior Camp for Boys) in 1942 and Interlochen (the new Junior Girls Camp) in 1944 from members of the Pennington family.</p>
      <p>Maddy's situation at the University of Michigan also improved. Early in 1940, Ruthven named Maddy acting director of Broadcasting Service, and soon afterward, the university took full control of the School of Music from the Musical Society. The new dean, Earl V. Moore, supported Maddy's work at the Camp. In 1942, when the contract with Illinois State University expired, the U. of M. assumed responsibility for the college division, and a year later, transferred its summer All-State high school program to Interlochen.</p>
      <p>After the reduction in Maddy's instructional broadcasts, he turned to the civic orchestra movement as a means of utilizing graduates of his programs. In the fall of 1939, he surveyed civic music directors throughout the country, and the following summer, he convened a meeting at the Camp to discuss "mutual problems." Within a year, he assumed leadership of the Ann Arbor Civic (Symphony) Orchestra, and working for the U. of M. Extension Service, formed the Michigan Civic Orchestra Association to promote mass orchestra performances.</p>
      <p>When America entered World War II, Governor Murray Van Wagoner appointed Maddy head of Michigan's Wartime Civic Music program to promote the war effort. As usual, Maddy based many of his activities at the Camp. In 1942, he held the organizing conference there, and the following year, a Clinic for civic music directors. Despite a battle with publishers over copyright, his group produced a patriotic songbook for general use. With university backing, he also led musical performances throughout the state and broadcast patriotic music over a network of Michigan stations fed by WJR in Detroit.</p>
      <p>Just as the outlook for Maddy and the Camp improved, they suffered a double blow. The introduction of wartime restrictions threatened Camp operations. Then, in July 1942, James Petrillo, the new head of the American Federation of Musicians, forced NBC to cancel its broadcasts from Interlochen (after thirteen years), citing a threat to union jobs. While the Camp struggled with rationing, travel restrictions, and the virtual disappearance of college-age men, Maddy worked to remove the limitations on his own and the Camp broadcasts.</p>
      <p>His efforts were two-fold: (1) to develop an alternative radio network, which ultimately, he decided, should use the new FM technology, and (2) to secure national legislation prohibiting union interference with student performances. NBC's cancellation of his instructional program convinced him that educators needed to create their own broadcasting network. In the late 1930's and early 1940's, he began soliciting support for such a project from state officials and leading educators.</p>
      <p>By early 1944, with FM technology presenting a viable alternative, he secured the backing of President Ruthven to travel throughout southern Michigan in support of his proposal. His efforts led to the formation of the Michigan Educational Radio Association to plan FM broadcasting in the state, and in 1945, he became chairman of the new Michigan Community Radio Commission. Only the lack of sufficient state funding prevented the immediate implementation of his plan, which eventually led the University of Michigan to establish its own FM station (1948).</p>
      <p>While Maddy labored to create an educational network, he succeeded in restoring Camp performances to the airwaves on a limited basis. In 1943, Michigan State College's new station (initially, AM) and Traverse City's WCTM resumed broadcasting from the Camp. As with his instructional programs, he also experimented with recordings to widen his audience. Eventually, they replaced live performances for broadcast, especially on the growing numbers of FM educational stations.</p>
      <p>In attempting to secure legislation against Petrillo, Maddy relied heavily on former Camper father and friend, Senator Arthur Vandenberg. The issue was complicated by union efforts to secure compensation for recordings played on commercial radio. By January 1945, when Maddy appeared on the verge of success, Petrillo retaliated by putting the Camp on the American Federation of Musicians' "Unfair List", banning members from teaching or performing at Interlochen. A year later, shortly before Congress enacted relief legislation, Maddy was dismissed from the union for violating the ban.</p>
      <p>While the Lea Act (1946) forbade restrictions on noncommercial broadcasts, Petrillo, through legal wrangling and skillful use of the "Unfair List," was able to circumvent it. In 1947, he reached a compromise with the leadership of the Music Educators National Conference. Under it, Petrillo waived all objections to performances by school groups, but by defining the Camp as a profit-making organization, he continued to limit its broadcasts. For over a decade, until Petrillo retired, the union ban remained in effect.</p>
      <p>Despite the limitation, the Camp prospered. Publicity about Petrillo's actions attracted both students and donors. During the height of the controversy, Camp enrollment doubled, and Maddy began obtaining significant financial contributions from business leaders. In 1944, retailer S.S. Kresge, Jr., made the first of several substantial gifts to the Camp. Other donors followed, often attracted by Maddy's stand against unionization or the Camp's principles of free competition.</p>
      <p>Although Maddy sought to end European dominance of American classical music, his success inevitably led him into international involvement. Early in 1940, he participated in the selection of a National Youth Administration orchestra to tour Latin America. Shortly thereafter, his old friend, Will Earhart, appointed him to the new State Department advisory committee on Inter-American Music. In his acceptance remarks, Maddy emphasized that music afforded the best means to overcome the language barrier. During the war, he encouraged Latin American music leaders to visit Interlochen and solicited support for their students as Campers. At the end of the conflict, he urged funding for a good will tour of Mexico by a high school orchestra.</p>
      <p>Like his friend Vandenberg, the war convinced Maddy of the need for international cooperation, and he became a supporter of the United Nations. In 1946, under his direction, the student council at Camp adopted a "Charter for Youth," which set forth principles of world unity. Two years later, he dedicated Kresge Auditorium, the Camp's new performance center, "to the promotion of World Friendship through the Universal Language of the Arts."</p>
      <p>When a mid-fifties thaw in the Cold War created opportunities for cultural exchange, Maddy lobbied the federal government for a Camp orchestra tour of Eastern Europe. Government, he argued, should aid groups of young amateurs, the world's future leaders, as it did the professionals. Having failed to secure federal assistance, he devoted the Camp's own resources to attracting foreign educators and students. Eventually, in 1964, he started the International (later World) Youth Symphony, composed of Campers from many nations, and two years later, arranged for the Camp to host the first meeting in America of the International Society of Music Educators.</p>
      <p>Maddy and the Camp emerged from World War II in excellent condition. While Maddy was secure at the university, the Camp was successful both financially and artistically. Because of the Camp's growing prosperity, Maddy was able to reduce his university appointment to part-time and devote even more of his energies to Interlochen's development.</p>
      <p>As the waiting list for Campers lengthened, he launched a vigorous program for new facilities and increased enrollment. In 1947, in order to better deal with the increased numbers, the Junior Division was split into Juniors (grades 3-6) and Intermediates (grades 7-9). Two years later, the All-State Piano Institute became the first of what were to be many post-camp programs for adults, and Maddy began to winterize new and existing buildings, so they could be used during colder weather. In the 1950's, loans from the University of Michigan helped considerably in Camp expansion.</p>
      <p>During the two decades following the war, the Camp grew from 155 buildings to 400, from 500 acres to 1,200, and from 900 Campers to 3,000. Although the union effectively barred professional musicians, music educators filled the void, and the Camp continued to produce first-rate alumni, who occupied leading positions with symphonies, opera and dance companies, and in other areas of contemporary life, both inside the arts and out.</p>
      <p>Amidst its growth, the Camp had to defeat threats from local boosters intent on developing the area economically. In 1953, Maddy thwarted a proposed state prison camp, and two years later, a federal air force base. The latter was vigorously promoted by Congresswoman Ruth Thompson of Whitehall, but Representatives Albert Engel of Lake City and Robert Griffin of Traverse City, both members of the Camp's Advisory Board, came to its defense.</p>
      <p>As the Camp grew, Maddy began to dream of making it a year-round institution for artistically talented youth. He envisioned a boarding high school and, eventually, a university that would provide training in both academic and artistic subjects. In planning the curriculum for the school, he relied heavily on Camp Advisory Board member, Martin ten Hoor, a former University of Michigan professor, now a dean at the University of Alabama.</p>
      <p>Nearing mandatory retirement from the university, Maddy initiated a major campaign to fulfill his dream. He added permanent staff, expanded facilities, and increased fund-raising efforts. On November 8, 1956, an alarmed Tremaine, in anticipation of his own imminent retirement as Camp Treasurer, wrote the Trustees a cautionary letter, based on his long experience with Camp finances. While he praised Maddy's vision and perseverance, he warned that Maddy's ambition needed to be restrained lest it put the institution in a precarious financial position as it had earlier.</p>
      <p>Despite Tremaine's admonition, Maddy proceeded with his expansion plans. Prior to 1956, the permanent staff consisted only of himself and a secretary (Peg Stace since 1941). He began the expansion by appointing Roger Jacobi as Camp Secretary and Director of Personnel (succeeded three years later by John A. Merrill). In 1957, he named George Wilson Vice President for Camp Operations, and in another year, Don Gillis, a composer and member of the musicians union, Director of Development. In part because of the Trustees' desire to groom a successor, Gillis received manifold responsibilities: to achieve a reconciliation with the new head of the musicians union, to direct the Camp's fledgling American Opera program, to oversee the Interlochen Press (which Maddy started in 1957 in hopes of generating income), to assist with expansion of the broadcast program, and perhaps most importantly, to aid in fund-raising.</p>
      <p>With Gillis' assistance, the dispute with the musicians union was quickly resolved, and in March 1959, the Camp was removed from its "Unfair List." Two years later, NBC broadcasts, now called "The Best from Interlochen," resumed on tape. The same summer, Maddy scored a major coup by enticing the young international award-winning pianist, Van Cliburn, to make the first of several appearances at Interlochen. Fund-raising went far less well, and in March 1961, Gillis submitted his resignation. Still, Maddy remained committed to converting the Camp into a year-round institution for youthful artists.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 1961, having formally retired from the university, Maddy moved the Camp office, over the objections of the permanent staff from Ann Arbor to Interlochen. Shortly thereafter, Norma Lee Browning Ogg, a <title render="italic">Chicago Tribune</title> writer and Camp publicist, introduced Maddy to Chicago insurance executive and philanthropist Clement Stone. The two hit it off immediately, and Stone agreed to fund Maddy's long-planned boarding school for high school students, the Interlochen Arts Academy. Almost immediately, Stone was appointed to the Board of Trustees, on which he remained a leading force for nearly two decades (becoming its chair upon Roscoe Bonisteel's death in July 1972).</p>
      <p>Within another year (1962), Maddy and the institutions he founded experienced more major triumphs. Van Cliburn again made a special appearance at the Camp, and in August, its dancers and orchestra performed for President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy on the White House lawn. The next month, the Interlochen Arts Academy, a major component of Maddy's dream, opened.</p>
      <p>The following year (1963) witnessed additional achievements. The "Today" Show made a special telecast from Interlochen; the institution's new FM station, WIAA, went on the air, and the Browning biography of Maddy appeared. In another year, the University of Michigan awarded Maddy an honorary doctorate. At the commencement ceremony, his fellow honoree, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, announced plans for a "Great Society." Shortly thereafter, the President's daughter, Lucy Baines Johnson, appeared at Interlochen as narrator for the National Youth Symphony performance of <title render="italic">Peter and the Wolf</title>, which Van Cliburn conducted. The summer ended triumphantly with the first Interlochen Arts Festival, featuring the new World Youth Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra led by Eugene Ormandy.</p>
      <p>On April 18, 1966, as Interlochen prepared for the opening session of the International Society of Music Educators (whose participants included Norman Dello Joyo, Dimitri Kabalevsky, and Zoltan Kodaly), Joseph Maddy died suddenly. Until a successor could be chosen, the Board of Trustees appointed an Administrative Committee to oversee operations. Chaired by John Merrill (Secretary of the Board), its members included George Wilson (Director of the Camp), Thor Johnson (Director of the Academy), Clare Burns (Treasurer of Interlochen), and Margaret Stace (Maddy's long-time secretary, now Assistant to the President).</p>
      <p>Within a year, the Board selected national classical music broadcaster Karl Haas as Maddy's successor. Haas had worked with Maddy for several years as head of Interlochen's Advisory Board, which helped raise private funds. He also served as chair (with Maddy a member) of the Michigan Cultural Commission's music committee and the State Council for the Arts (created by Governor George Romney), which provided state assistance to Interlochen. In addition, the European born and educated Haas offered the strong international ties which Interlochen valued.</p>
      <p>As president, Haas announced his major goal would be to "fulfill Joe Maddy's dreams," by securing funding for the proposed College of the Arts. To assist him, he named John Merrill Vice President for Administrative Affairs and Development. In 1968, a new institutional name, "The Interlochen Center for the Arts," was adopted to cover the Camp, Academy, and proposed college.</p>
      <p>Despite great efforts, fund raising failed to fulfill expectations. The relationship between the Camp and Academy remained strained, and some Board members grew dissatisfied with student behavior (particularly at the Academy, where the new youth culture took hold). Changing tastes in music, especially among the young, and in family vacation patterns as well as the development of competing institutions, such as the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp in Michigan (which opened the summer following Maddy's death), threatened Interlochen's unchallenged preeminence. In November 1969, Merrill announced his acceptance of a development position at Northwestern University, and four months later, after a board meeting at which he outlined his proposals for Interlochen's future, Haas submitted his resignation.</p>
      <p>Until a permanent head could be chosen, George Wilson, who was nearing retirement as Camp director, agreed to serve as Interim President. A year later (1971), the Board named music educator and long-time Interlochen administrator and instructor Roger Jacobi to head the institution. Following his resignation in 1959 as Board secretary, Jacobi continued to teach summers at the Camp while holding a joint appointment with the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor public schools, much as Maddy once did. Then, in 1968, Jacobi became Assistant Dean of the Music School, in which capacity he served as Director of the Camp's University Division (Allen Britton and Paul Boylan, who held the post earlier and later, eventually became Deans of the Music School).</p>
      <p>During Jacobi's eighteen year presidency, he defused tensions inherent in the transition from the Maddy era and put the institution on a solid financial basis. Physical facilities were significantly improved, and for the first time, a major endowment was established. Interlochen continued to attract leading artists and to produce high quality graduates. It also served as the model (with George Wilson's assistance) for a similar music camp in the Philippines, and in 1975, hosted a visit by President and Mrs. Gerald Ford. On the eve of Jacobi's retirement, he discontinued (after the 1988 season) the University Division, an important tie to the University of Michigan for thirty-seven years.</p>
      <p>Jacobi's advance announcement of his intention to retire at age sixty-five gave the Trustees ample time to prepare for an orderly transition. In 1989, they chose Dean Boal, a distinguished college-level teacher and administrator and public broadcasting executive, to became the first Interlochen president who neither knew nor worked with Maddy. Prior to coming for his selection interview, Boal had only visited Interlochen once, and then, just briefly.</p>
      <p>Shortly after his appointment (1989), the National Music Camp was renamed "the Interlochen Arts Camp," reflecting its incorporation into the larger institution and expansion beyond music. Despite a recession-induced cut in state funding, Boal kept the operation financially sound and oversaw the growth of the Academy and Camp to record enrollments. He also increased the scope of summer professional offerings, which attracted growing numbers of outsiders to the Camp. Like all of Maddy's successors, he faced the tensions inherent in trying to balance needed changes with valued traditions.</p>
      <p>Early in 1994, Boal announced his intention of taking early retirement as soon as a successor could be chosen. A year later, the trustees named youth educator Richard F. Odell, headmaster of the Chicago Academy for the Arts, to lead Interlochen into the twenty-first century. Like Boal, Odell lacked previous association with Maddy and the institution he founded.</p>
      <p>On becoming president, Odell spent much of his first year meeting with Interlochen supporters both on campus and throughout the country in order to define the institution's future goals. Then, he announced a major fund-raising program to renovate facilities and increase endowment, adding that he hoped to make Interochen better known both in its home area and beyond. In fact, during Odell's tenure, the camp was named one of the top ten camps in the country and the World Youth Symphony Orchestra performed in the Cultural Olympiad at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, GA.</p>
      <p>Odell was succeeded by Edward J. Downing. During Downing's time in office, Interlochen merged with The Pathfinder School, a local independent day school for pre-school through eighth-grade students. Downing retired in 2002 and was succeeded by Jeffery S. Kimpton in 2003.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The records of the Interlochen Center for the Arts were received in installments over many years. They came from several sources: the Camp office in Ann Arbor, the Tremaine family, an alumni leader, and various administrators at Interlochen, but the greatest proportion was assembled from Maddy's home and Interlochen offices, after his death, by Margaret (Peg) Stace, his long-time assistant.</p>
      <p>The Camp files for 1935-1945 comprise the major portion received in their original order, and they were in disarray because of frequent changes in Camp secretaries and the practice of moving the office (along with relevant files) from Ann Arbor to Interlochen and back each summer. Also, Maddy kept many items of a personal and confidential nature at home.</p>
      <p>In processing the records, an attempt was made both to preserve the original order, where ascertainable, and to highlight major subjects and individuals, some of whose importance only became apparent with the passage of time. A separate name index is available for major correspondents. Where extant, explanatory historical and background information has been placed at the front of records categories. Because of Maddy's influence on the development of Interlochen both past and present, his correspondence with later administrators has been included if practical, under "Administration" in their papers.</p>
      <p>The surviving records have been divided into nine series: Chronological, Subject, Post-Maddy Administrators, Boards, Closed, Printed, Visual Materials, Sound Recordings, and Scrapbooks. The Chronological focuses on Maddy and the Camp until 1966 while the Subject, is composed of two subseries. The first, mainly 1928-1989, though also heavily relating to Maddy, also includes much on developments through the '90s. The second subseries, 1930-2003, Later Acquisition represents a group of files that were acquired in 2005. Many files pertain to the early camp and Joesph Maddy. The Post-Maddy Administrators series begins in the late 1950's when Maddy expanded the staff in anticipation of making Interlochen a year-round institution and continues unto the most recent accession. Boards (governing bodies) starts with the Camp's founding in 1928 and ends in 1989 while the Closed series covers the Maddy, Haas, and Wilson administrations through 1971. Printed offers coverage to the present but is more complete for the early years through the 1980's. While the Visual Materials and Sound Recordings series extend from the 1920's into the 1980's, it offers best coverage from 1924 to 1942 Scrapbooks, with gaps in the early years, documents both Maddy and the Camp, beginning with the National High School Orchestra and ending with the Camp's 50th anniversary celebration in 1978.</p>

          <p>The Chronological series emphasizes Maddy and the Camp until 1966. It is divided into several subseries: Maddy biography, Camp history, Camp files, 1935-1945, Camp files, 1945-1966, and Special correspondence. The first two subseries provide documentation for the earliest years.

            <p>Camp files, 1935-1945, consists mainly of Maddy's correspondence concerning the administration of the Camp, as maintained by Maddy and whoever happened to be his secretary at the time (his first wife Marie until 1937, John M. Lewis until 1938, Helen Hollingsworth until 1941, and Margaret "Peg" Stace thereafter). Its organization reflects the various filing systems of their creators and the seasonal nature of the Camp (with the office being located in Ann Arbor most of the year and then, transferred to Interlochen for the summer). A good overview of decisions regarding the Camp can be found in the correspondence of Giddings and Tremaine. Items of a personal nature on Maddy are usually filed under his name.</p>
            <p>Matters covered in this subseries involve students, parents, staff, faculty, and guest conductors as well as the courses and programs offered, acquisition of instruments and music (including relationships with manufacturers and publishers), maintenance and improvement of facilities, and use of advertising and promotion. Documentation is provided on the introduction of instruction in dance, drama, broadcasting, and art and in such instruments as the saxophone and accordion. Information is also supplied on Maddy's dispute with the publishers association on gifts of music to educational institutions.</p>
            <p>Problems of the Depression are highlighted along with the wartime difficulties of operating the Camp with government controls and limited enrollments (especially the shortage of college age males). Camper and former Camper correspondence provides personal experiences with economic hardship and military service. Pre-war faculty applications reflect the immigration to America of European musicians, many of them Jewish, while wartime files refer to the substitution of women musicians for men, including the development of "all girl" orchestras.</p>

            <p>Far less extensive in nature, the Camp files, 1945-1966 subseries represents what survived from the remainder of the Maddy administration. His correspondence with Giddings and Tremaine, faculty and staff, and others are included. Until Giddings and Tremaine ended their active participation (by the late 1940's and late 1950's respectively), their exchanges with Maddy continued to provide insight into Camp operations: Giddings mainly on personnel and Tremaine on finances. From the late 1950's on, Maddy exercised more independence in making decisions. While faculty and staff are fairly well represented in the later files, little survived from a student perspective other than a few laudatory letters. Researchers will need to examine the earlier Camp subseries as well as the Subject, Printed, and Scrapbooks series for information about Camper life.</p>

            <p>The final subseries contains Special correspondence, mainly 1928-1966. Assembled from the Camp files, 1935-1945, and from earlier and later materials saved by Maddy and his associates, it relates to individuals of prominence or those with close personal ties to Maddy. While most corresponded directly with Maddy, occasionally, a top associate, especially Maddy's secretary, wrote. Where an individual had a continuing relationship with the Camp or reference is made to past association with Maddy, items after his death are included. Apart from the information contained on the correspondents, the subseries should prove especially valuable in association with the Camp files, 1935-1945 and 1945-1966. A name index indicates the locations of their correspondence elsewhere in the collection.</p>
            <p>Almost all the special correspondents can be found in <title render="italic">Who's Who</title> or <title render="italic">Who Was Who in America</title>. Most gained fame in musical performance. Included are Percy Grainger, Frederic Fennell, Ferde Grofe, Pablo Casals, Howard Hanson, Josha Heifitz, Paul Whiteman, Loren Maazel, Eugene Ormandy, and Jan Sibelius. Other fields and individuals represented include music education: Peter Dykema and Will Earhart, educational broadcasting: W. W. Charters and Edgar B. Gordon, commercial broadcasting: Franklin Dunham and Judith Waller, business: S. S. Kresge and the Alden and Herbert Dow family, and politics: Wilber Brucker and Arthur Vandenberg.</p>

            <p>The Subject Files series, is divided into two subseries. The first, mainly 1928-1989, emphasizes Maddy and his administration of Interlochen although later materials, especially for the decade or two following his death, are also included. It has six sub-subseries: Joseph Maddy, Giddings and Tremaine, Interlochen, Camp, Academy, and College. The Maddy sub-subseries focuses on his career activities apart from Interlochen while Giddings and Tremaine contains background information and publications of the two other early Camp leaders. Interlochen covers subjects affecting the institution in general, mainly the Camp before 1962 and both it and the Academy thereafter. The remaining sub-subseries focus on detailed planning and operation of: the National Music Camp, Interlochen Arts Academy, and proposed Interlochen College of Creative Arts.</p>

              <p>The Maddy sub-subseries contains information on his professional activities outside Interlochen. Many of them relate to his role as a faculty member of the university. Although direct ties to Interlochen are lacking, virtually everything he did somehow involved the institution he founded. The sub-subseries consists of six subsections: Appearances, Broadcasting, Civic Music, Music Education, Publications, Speeches and Writings, and University of Michigan.</p>

                <p>"Appearances", 1926-1965, deals mainly with his role as a conductor and judge at band and orchestra contests and festivals. It includes both correspondence and printed programs, and is divided according to Michigan and out-of-state performances. Although the correspondence largely deals with arrangements, it sometimes discusses music education in general and local conditions in particular. Since many of Maddy's early in-state visits were scheduled through the Extension Service, researchers will also want to consult the University of Michigan category of this sub-subseries, and for his wartime appearances, Civic Music. For printed programs, researchers should check the Graduate and Music School Libraries (where, according to his records, he donated a complete set in 1940).</p>

                <p>"Broadcasting", mainly 1931-1948, documents Maddy's non-Interlochen radio work. It includes his correspondence and scripts for instrumental and vocal education programs as well as correspondence, reports, and other records on his attempt to create an alternative to commercial radio, largely using the new FM technology. Scripts include those used by announcers Mike Wallace and Ward Quaal and texts of radio addresses on Americanism by Murray Van Wagoner, Leo Fitzpatrick, and Karl Detzer. Researchers will also want to check "Civic Music" for Maddy's wartime broadcasts and "Music Education" for the professional educators' program "Music and American Youth." Since much of his non-Interlochen broadcasting was done for the university, reports and other information about it can be found under "University of Michigan" (6) in this sub-subseries. Recordings and a movie film of his instructional programs can be found in the Visual Materials and Sound Recordings series.</p>

                <p>"Civic Music" (1939-1961) includes correspondence, programs, reports, and other materials on Maddy's adult orchestra endeavors, including the wartime civic music program. Its coverage begins with the organizing conference for National Civic Music at the Camp and continues with his directorship of the Ann Arbor Civic Orchestra Association and Michigan Civic Music Association, especially the latter's massed orchestra performances. The Wartime Civic Music materials cover his appearances and broadcasts, his battle with publishers over production of a patriotic songbook for public use, and his solicitation of new musical works with a patriotic theme.</p>

                <p>"Music Education" (1921-1966), contains Maddy's correspondence on general developments in the field and on his work with professional organizations. The former mainly concerns responses to inquiries. He deals with overall trends, such as the decline of school orchestras and the need for string instruction, as well as elaborating on teaching techniques for specific instruments. Correspondence of a similar nature with leading music educators can be found in Chronology Special Correspondence and with radio listeners in Subject Interlochen-Broadcasting. The string workshop which he taught at Interlochen is documented in Subject Camp under "Course Materials."</p>
                <p>His major professional work for the Music Educators National Conference (MENC), 1921-1966, begins with background information on orchestra and band contests and festivals. It continues with his work arranging student performances for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago (where he first came into conflict with Petrillo). It also covers his leadership of the Research Council, particularly the publication on Music Rooms and Equipment (including its proposed revisions).</p>
                <p>Records on his presidency and executive committee service follow as do those on his Broadcast Committee leadership, including the MENC national radio program, "Music and American Youth," 1938-1940 (where he again ran into problems with Petrillo). The section concludes with records covering the remainder of his relations with the MENC, including its support of efforts for a postwar youth orchestra tour of Europe and its 1959 meeting at the Camp. His reaction to the MENC leadership agreement with Petrillo (1947) can be found in the series Subject Interlochen "Petrillo" and in the Giddings and Tremaine correspondence of Chronological Camp files, 1945-1966. The archives of the MENC are preserved at the McKeldin Library of the University of Maryland.</p>
                <p>His other professional activities include service on the National Committee for Music in Education, 1938-1940, which lobbied for creation of a Fine Arts Division within the U.S. Department of Education. For organizations associated with Interlochen (institutional support or membership), researchers should consult Subject Interlochen "Organizations" in this series.</p>

                <p>"Publications, Speeches, and Writings"(1920-1968) subsection includes Maddy's correspondence with publishers and collaborators, drafts of his works, articles by and about him, his music education publications, and his music arrangements. Many of his articles were publicity pieces for the Camp. His other publications were largely instructional in nature, both individual and group. His musical arrangements, including for Howard Hanson, reflect his extensive activity in the field. His few attempts at composition are included with them. Maddy's relationship with ASCAP is documented, but researchers interested in its association with the Camp should also check Subject Interlochen "Organizations."</p>

              <p>The Giddings and Tremaine sub-subseries features biographical information on and publications by the other two early leaders of the Camp. The Giddings portion, 1907-1953, contains largely his manuscript and printed writings: radio scripts (for instructional programs), speeches, articles, texts, and life reminiscences. Tremaine's section, 1932-1962, includes publications, reports, and some correspondence, relating mainly to his work with the National Bureau for Advancement of Music (NBAM).</p>

              <p>The Interlochen sub-subseries covers topics relevant to the institution in general, mainly under Maddy but also under his successors until 1989. The sub-subseries has been further divided into seventeen subsections: (1) Alumni, (2) Broadcasting, (3) Campus, (4) Financial, (5) Fund Raising/Development, (6) Interlochen Arts Festival, (7) Interlochen Press, (8) International, (9) International Society of Music Educators, (10) Michigan, (11) Organizations, (12) Petrillo Controversy, (13) Publicity/Promotion, (14) Special Events and Programs, (15) Traverse City, (16) United States Government, and (17) University of Michigan. Materials before 1962 usually relate to the Camp, and thereafter, to both the Camp and Academy. The files often document activities which Maddy initiated, but which were subsequently handled by others.</p>

                <p>"Alumni" (1), 1940-1976, begins with directories and lists of distinguished graduates, but most of it relates to Alumni surveys, 1940-1942, and attempts to form alumni organizations, beginning in 1941 through the mid 1970's. The surveys were done to involve graduates, particularly in recruiting students and funding scholarships. The surveys for 1940 and 1942 are virtually complete except for the "A" section of the alphabet, where only scattered returns survive. They give good information about the respondents, some of whom became quite distinguished in their fields.</p>
                <p>At the time of the surveys, an attempt was made to establish alumni clubs, and periodically thereafter, similar efforts were made, largely in conjunction with fund raising, but it was not until the mid 1960's that the present Alumni Association was formed. Notes, minutes, and other materials document its planning, organization, and work. For more recent activities, researchers should consult the Sheryl Szady segment of the Post-Maddy Administrators series.</p>

                <p>"Broadcasting" (2), mainly 1930-1966, includes correspondence, scripts, and related materials. It is particularly strong for the early years, 1930-1945, and "The Best from Interlochen" era, 1961-1966. The former includes correspondence with listeners and the latter with guest speakers, most of whom were quite distinguished and played active roles in the institution. For the early years, researchers should consult the Judith Waller and Franklin Dunham files in the Chronological Special Correspondents, and for "The Best from Interlochen", the Post-Maddy Administrators Gillis. Information about Interlochen broadcasting, especially WIAA (started in 1963) can also be found in Post-Maddy Administrators Jacobi , Boards, Post-Maddy Administrators Boal.</p>

                <p>The "Campus" subsection (3), 1930-1989, details the development of buildings, facilities, and property shared by the Camp and Academy. Information is included on the planning for and dedication of buildings. Maps help provide an overview of the campus growth. Documentation is also provided on equipment (especially for radio work), grounds (vegetation and wildlife), physical plant (sawmill and generator), property (survey and sale), and the recent introduction of sculptures to campus. Researchers will find additional materials about buildings in Chronological Camp Files, 1935-1945 and Special Correspondence "Alden Dow" as well as the "Fund Raising" (5) and "Organizations" (11) subsections of this sub-subseries. A tape of the Grand Traverse Performing Arts Center dedication is part of the Sound Recordings series. More recent campus planning can be found in the Sheryl Szady segment of the Post-Maddy Administrators series.</p>

                <p>The "Financial" files (4), 1928-1988, have a Maddy era, 1928-1965, and later, 1966-1988, component. The earlier consists largely of detailed papers and records, mainly analyses and reports on all aspects of operations prepared by the Bookkeeper-Assistant Treasurer-Treasurer (Marie Maddy until 1937, George G. Mackmiller until 1962, and Clare D. Burns thereafter) for use by Joseph Maddy. Some correspondence with Maddy and Tremaine is also included. The Tremaine correspondence in Chronological Camp files, 1935-1966, provides a good overview of financial developments in this era. The later portion, 1966-1988, contains largely bound reports prepared for general administrative use. They should prove especially valuable in conjunction with the Boards Trustees series.</p>
                <p>"Fund Raising/Development" (5), 1928-1978 (with some later promotional materials), details efforts to secure financing for facilities and scholarships. It includes correspondence, reports, prospectuses, and promotional materials covering the sale of debentures and the gift of buildings and scholarships. Appeals to alumni, parents, foundations, and the Traverse City business community are covered, encompassing efforts by professional fund raisers, agents, Interlochen personnel and friends.</p>
                <p>Researchers will also want to consult in this sub-subseries: "Alumni" (1) and "Publicity/Promotion" (13) as well as: "Campus" (3) for donations of facilities and art works and "Organizations" (11) for gifts of scholarships and buildings. In addition, they will want to check Post-Maddy Administrators Donald Gillis and Karl Haas under "Fund Raising" and Roger Jacobi under "Development" as well as the Boards series,and the correspondents index for S. S. Kresge and Clement Stone.</p>

                <p>"Interlochen Arts Festival" (6), 1963-1975 with gaps, deals with the development of the professional summer program. Most concern Maddy's efforts to secure a major symphony orchestra, 1963-1965. Printed materials which further document festival events, 1964-1993, can be found in Printed-Interlochen "Camp.".</p>

                <p>The institution's attempt to become a publisher and distributor of music is detailed in "Interlochen Press" (7), 1957-1976. It includes correspondence, minutes, and reports on the Press's active period, 1957-1962, as well as materials on the formal dissolution in 1976. Researchers will also want to consult Don Gillis in the Post-Maddy Administrators series.</p>

                <p>"International" (8), 1940-1981, covers Interlochen's endeavors to broaden its outreach. It includes information on Maddy's Latin American contacts during World War II, foreign visitors and Campers, proposed tours by Interlochen groups, and the development of the World Youth Symphony. The bulk of the material consists of: (1) correspondence beginning in the mid 1950's on attempts to secure government funding for a European tour by Camp musicians and (2) records starting in the 1960's on efforts to develop an International (later World) Youth Symphony. The former includes letters from many prominent American political figures. For Interlochen's role in the creation of the National Music Camp of the Philippines, researchers should see Post-Maddy Administrators Wilson.</p>

                <p>The "International Society of Music Educators" (9), 1963-1967, documents the 1966 ISME meeting at Interlochen, its first ever in America. Maddy's work in securing the convention is reflected in the planning, but the major portion deals with the final arrangements for speakers, performers, and exhibitors by Lyman Starr of the Special Events Office. Copies of conference talks and participant letters from Norman Dello Joio, Demitri Kabalevsky, and Zoltan Kodaly are included. Researchers will also want to check the Scrapbooks series.</p>

                <p>"Michigan" (10), 1936-1988, focuses mainly on Camp relations with state government during the Maddy era, 1936-1965. Included are controversies over the development of Interlochen State Park, the relocation of the main highway, and a proposed prison camp (1953). It also covers gubernatorial appearances and attempts to secure legislative subsidies for performance trips (such as to the 1939 World's Fair) and promotional movies (which received aid from 1939 through 1954). Information on the controversy over the proposed Camp orchestra appearance at the Mackinac Bridge dedication (1958) can be found in "Petrillo controversy" (12) while the attempt in 1979 to locate a state prison camp near Interlochen is documented in Post-Maddy Administrators Jacobi.</p>
                <p>The State's cultural efforts are covered in files on the Michigan Cultural Commission (1960-1963) and the Michigan Council of the Arts (1963-1965). They show Maddy's work with Karl Haas, who later became President of Interlochen. On the Michigan Council of the Arts, researchers should also consult Post-Maddy Administrators Haas and Jacobi and Boal .</p>
                <p>Related materials concern the Michigan Youth Arts Festival, a Michigan Cultural Commission offspring (suggested in 1962 by William Stirton of the U. of M. and promoted by Maddy). Correspondence, minutes, and programs document its origins and subsequent development, especially the Interlochen auditions and Flint Michigan Week performances (sponsored by Harding Mott).</p>

                <p>"Organizations" (11), 1935-1976, concern professional and support groups associated with Interlochen. Many of them provided gifts of buildings, scholarships, and music as well as held meetings there. Arranged alphabetically, the files include mainly correspondence but also some minutes, reports, and articles. Most relate to the Maddy era although items from the Haas and Jacobi presidencies are included. The Michigan Federation of Music Clubs files document the history of the group and its long association with Interlochen. Information on the American Bandmaster Association convention (1936) can be found in Chronological Camp files, 1935-1945.</p>

              <scopecontent>
                <p>The "Petrillo Controversy" (12), 1930-1987, covers the American Federation of Musicians ban on broadcasting from (as well as teaching or performing at) Interlochen. It begins with overview accounts of the controversy and surviving documents on Maddy's earlier dealings with the musicians union. For the origins of the controversy, researchers will also want to check Subject Maddy "Music Education" under "Music Educators National Conference."</p>
                <p>Correspondence, testimony, notes, and newspaper articles document Maddy's efforts to lift the ban. The correspondence includes exchanges with many Congressmen, especially members of the Michigan delegation (particularly Senator Arthur Vandenberg and Congressman Albert Engel). Maddy also dealt extensively with Congressmen Clarence Lea of California and Carroll Kearns of Pennsylvania. Former Governor Wilber Brucker of Michigan, served as Maddy's legal counsel on the issue during the early 1950's.</p>
                <p>Because of bulk, the correspondence is sometimes separated into special (Maddy) and general files. The former includes individuals of particular importance on the issue, to the Camp or in society, while the latter contains general support letters (which often include responses from Congressmen). Researchers interested in the efforts to lift the ban should also consult the Giddings and Tremaine correspondence in Chronological Camp files, 1935-1966.</p>
                <p>The final portion on the Petrillo controversy deals with its settlement and the Camp's subsequent relations with the American Federation of Musicians and other unions, especially the United Automobile Workers. On the resolution of the controversy, researchers will also want to consult Post-Maddy Administrators Gillis.</p>

                <p>"Publicity/Promotion" (13), 1939-1972, covers both staff and commercial endeavors. The former concern Interlochen's own print, film, and recording efforts. Correspondence, manuscript writings, press releases, and publications, 1946-1971, are included. For earlier publicity efforts, researchers should check Chronological Camp files, 1935-1945 under "Publicity." They will also find the Publications and Scrapbooks series useful.</p>

                <p>"Special Events" (14), 1948-1989, documents activities which the Office of Special Events now handles: post-camp conferences, off-campus performances, and domestic visitors. Post-camp conference materials, 1951-1989, include correspondence on planning and arrangements as well as informational literature.</p>
                <p>Similar materials characterize the off-campus performances by Interlochen groups. They are divided into appearances by the Camp, 1948-1972, and Academy, 1963-88. The former covers trips to the Mackinac Bridge dedication, 1958 (see Petrillo controversy), and the White House, 1962. The Academy portion includes in-state outreach tours sponsored by the Michigan Council for the Arts as well as appearances at Lincoln Center (1964), Carnegie Hall (1969), and Kennedy Center (1972) and a Choir trip to Denmark (1973). Information on earlier tours can be found in the Chronological Camp files, 1935-1945 while foreign visitors are covered under "International" (8) and "International Society of Music Educators" (9) in this sub-subseries.</p>

                <p>"Traverse City" (15), 1958-1969, offers fragmentary materials on Interlochen's relations with its home area. Included is a geography master's thesis (1965) on the Camp's economic impact. More detailed information about the relations with the Grand Traverse region can be found in "Fund Raising" (5), "Michigan" (10), and "U. S. Government" (16) in this sub-subseries as well as the Giddings and Tremaine correspondence in the Chronological Camp files, 1935-1966 and the Boards Control series.</p>

                <p>Dealings with federal officials and units are detailed in "United States Government"(16), 1934-1977. Matters covered include the Federal Music Project (1937-1948), operational problems during World War II, postwar construction projects, the Jet Air Base controversy (1954-1957), and the HEW grant for an Honors Musicianship Project (1964-1968). Michigan congressional leaders are well represented in the correspondence. On federal government matters, researchers will also want to consult "International" (8) and "Petrillo controversy" (12) as well as the Giddings and Tremaine correspondence in the Chronological Camp files, 1935-1966.</p>

                <p>"University of Michigan" (17), mainly 1940-1970, concerns Interlochen's relations with its major academic partner. Most pertains to the Camp, especially the University/All State Division, from 1942 on. It also covers the university financial loan to the Camp (1953) when a major building (the hotel) needed replacement. Correspondence with university officials as well as draft and final agreements and reports of the Director of the University Division are included. Researchers will again find the Giddings and Tremaine correspondence in the Chronological Camp files (I-C and D) most helpful.</p>

              <p>Camp sub-subseries, 1928-1989, offers detailed operational materials on the summer program. Coverage is best from the late 1930's through late 1960's and includes much mimeographed material. Rosters, forms, memos, statistics, reports, and similar type items predominate while correspondence is sparse. Unit and divisional reports, constituting approximately half the total sub-subseries, give elaborate accounts of non-musical activities at the Camp, but are confined almost exclusively to the 1960's and are heavily oriented to girls' division. The planning and recommendation files give the reflective comments of staff members on their experiences with programs and suggestions for the future.</p>
              <p>The materials present a variety of potential research uses. While application forms reflect changing admission standards, enrollment statistics (compiled by Maddy) and rosters indicate how many were in Camp, who they were, and what they did. Course materials include items on Maddy's string instrument workshop, to which he devoted increasing emphasis as bands grew in popularity on the high school level. Informational materials indicate the parameters in which students, staff, and faculty were expected to operate. Student government items are also included. The sub-subseries serves as an especially useful supplement to the Chronological Camp files, 1935-1966</p>

              <p>"Alumni" (1), 1940-1976, begins with directories and lists of distinguished graduates, but most of it relates to Alumni surveys, 1940-1942, and attempts to form alumni organizations, beginning in 1941 through the mid 1970's. The surveys were done to involve graduates, particularly in recruiting students and funding scholarships. The surveys for 1940 and 1942 are virtually complete except for the "A" section of the alphabet, where only scattered returns survive. They give good information about the respondents, some of whom became quite distinguished in their fields.</p>
              <p>At the time of the surveys, an attempt was made to establish alumni clubs, and periodically thereafter, similar efforts were made, largely in conjunction with fund raising, but it was not until the mid 1960's that the present Alumni Association was formed. Notes, minutes, and other materials document its planning, organization, and work. For more recent activities, researchers should consult the Sheryl Szady segment of the Post-Maddy Administrators series.</p>

              <p>Interlochen (Subject) College of Creative Arts contains planning materials, 1966-1968. They include the prospectus for the college, which Maddy submitted a month before his death, and subsequent follow-up materials. Researchers should also check the indexed correspondence for Alden Dow, who did the architectural planning for the college, as well as the Post-Maddy Administrators Karl Haas and Boards Trustees sub-subseries during the late 1960's and early 1970's.</p>
              <p>The yearly operational files, 1962-1976, include mainly mimeographed items but also some correspondence and, in the early years, Maddy notes. Information on off-campus tours can be found in Interlochen "Special Events" of this sub-subseries, and Maddy speeches in Subject Maddy "Publications." Researchers interested in the history of the Academy should also consult Printed-Articles, Scrapbooks, Post-Maddy Administrators, especially Haas and Jacobi, Boards-Trustees, and Post-Maddy Administrators.</p>

            <p>The second subseries, 1930-2003, Later Acquisition, contains records that were received in the year 2005 as an addition to the existing record group. Some duplication of materials from the previous accession may exist. However, an effort was made to eliminate such files, and researchers are encouraged to check this subseries for records that are believed to be unique regarding topics such as the early development of the camp, Maddy's correspondence, and Maddy's funeral. There are also materials relating to events that occurred at a later date than are represented in the files belonging to the earlier acquisition. Especially interesting are the Special Events and News Releases subseries.</p>

          <p>The fourth series, Post-Maddy Administrators, contains records of individuals who knew and worked with Maddy and held important positions from the expansion of the late 1950's through 1989. It consists of six subseries: Donald Gillis, director of development (1958-1962), John A. Merrill, board secretary, administrative committee chairman, and vice president (1959-1969), Margaret A. "Peg" Stace, Maddy's long-time secretary (1942-1966) and eventual corporate secretary (1967-1973), George Wilson, director of the Camp (1957-1979) and acting president (1970-1971), Karl Haas, president (1967-1970), and Roger Jacobi, board secretary and director of personnel (1956-1959), director of the university division (1968-1971), and president (1971-1989). Researchers should also check the Subject and Boards series for correspondence and other information on their roles. Also included in the subseries are files that cover the period from 1989 on and the new generation of Interlochen leaders, who lacked ties to Maddy: Dean Boal, who succeeded Jacobi as president, Sheryl Szady, who played an important role in alumni activities, Richard Odell succeeding Boal, and Edward Downing succeeding Odell. Boal documents the first half of the Boal presidency (1989-1992) Szady the second half as well as the transition to the administration of Richard Odell (1992-1995). Odell covers his term of office (1995-1998) and Downing covers the first two years of his term (1998-2003).</p>

            <p>Donald Gillis, 1954-1962, contains personal background information and correspondence, including on his activities as a composer, but the great bulk concerns his administrative duties at Interlochen, 1958-1962. Much of the latter pertains to his leadership of the American Opera Theatre and publication of the Catalogue of American Operas. Included are correspondence, planning and promotional materials, and reports. The subject files detail his other activities at Interlochen. Researchers should also consult the Subject series for his role in planning the Academy as well as Interlochen: "Broadcasting," "Fund raising," "Interlochen Press," and the "Petrillo controversy." His later views on the institution, 1973-1977, can be found in the "Personal" section of Roger Jacobi in this subseries (F).</p>

            <p>Margaret A. "Peg" Stace consists of a small file of biographical information and post-Maddy correspondence, 1966-1979. Following her retirement as Board Secretary in 1973, much of her letters deal with inquiries about the history of Interlochen and its records. The Chronological Camp files includes her earlier correspondence (1941-1966) while the Boards Trustees contains information on both her earlier and later roles, especially as Board secretary, 1967-1973. When Maddy grew increasingly preoccupied with expansion, she assumed much of the responsibility for maintaining contact with organizations, especially women's groups, which traditionally supported Interlochen, so researchers will also find her correspondence in Subject Interlochen "Organizations."</p>

            <p>George Wilson, mainly 1958-1978, consists of biographical/professional information and Interlochen administrative records, most of which he personally selected for placement here. A small file of materials concerns his service as Interim President (1970-1971), and others deal with his association with Presidents Joseph Maddy, Karl Haas, and Roger Jacobi. The great majority of the records consist of correspondence, minutes, reports, and similar items on the operation of the National Music Camp, 1957-1979, especially its challenge system. Information is also supplied on the development of similar music camps abroad, particularly in the Philippines. On his directorship of the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra, 1957-1961, researchers should consult Subject series under Madd "Civic Music" and on his leadership of the Camp, Haas and Jacobi in this series and the Boards Trustees series. For his oral history reminiscences of Interlochen, they should check the Sound Recordings series.</p>

            <p>The Karl Haas subseries covers his appointment, inauguration, and presidency of Interlochen, 1967-1970. Included are biographical materials, newspaper articles, and letters. The presidential portion includes alphabetical correspondence with individuals and organizations outside Interlochen, many of whom are quite distinguished. The administrative and subject sections of the presidential files relate largely to internal matters. They include letters from Merrill and Stace as well as files on fund raising, the Academy, Camp, and proposed College. For Haas' early relationship to Interlochen, researchers should consult the Michigan Cultural Commission and Michigan Council for the Arts files in the Subject series and Advisory Board portion of the Boards series. The Boards Trustees files also contain information on his presidency and resignation. Subsequent attempts to restore his ties to Interlochen can be found in Jacobi in this series and in Post-Maddy Administrators Boal.</p>

            <p>Roger Jacobi, contains mainly materials dealing with his presidency, 1971-1989, which he selected for placement here. His files are divided into five sections: (1) Personal, (2) Interlochen, (3) Academy, (4) Camp, and (5) Alphabetical. Personal (1) documents his biography, honors, publications, and talks, but also includes correspondence of a personal nature with Don Gillis (1973-1977) and Frederick Fennell (1983-1989) about Interlochen and other subjects.</p>
            <p>For further information on Jacobi's work at Interlochen, researchers should also consult the Subject series, especially Campus and the Boards Trustees, particularly during his presidency (his work as Board Secretary, 1956-1959, being largely routine).</p>

              <p>The Interlochen section (2) covers the institution in general, both Camp and Academy. It begins with a small file of Jacobi's pre-presidential correspondence, 1957-1971, mainly with Maddy, and continues with extensive subject files from his presidency, 1971-1989. Major portions concern Broadcasting (WIAA), Development/Fund-raising, Michigan, Organizations, and Special Programs and Events. Under Michigan, the files of Michigan Council for the Arts contain much information on state aid to Interlochen. The Organizations include the Concerned Citizens for the Arts in Michigan, the National Arts Awards panel of the Educational Testing Service, and the Michigan (Civic) Orchestra Association (which Maddy helped found).</p>

              <p>The Alphabetical (5) correspondence files, 1988-1989, represent the only portion of the Jacobi papers received in their original order (having been left for his successor Dean Boal). They include correspondence with faculty and staff (past and present), members of the Maddy family, Karl Haas, parents, students, friends, and performers. As Jacobi nears retirement, he often reflects on his experiences at Interlochen and as a young instructor in the Ann Arbor public school system.</p>

              <p>The Alphabetical (5) correspondence files, 1988-1989, represent the only portion of the Jacobi papers received in their original order (having been left for his successor Dean Boal). They include correspondence with faculty and staff (past and present), members of the Maddy family, Karl Haas, parents, students, friends, and performers. As Jacobi nears retirement, he often reflects on his experiences at Interlochen and as a young instructor in the Ann Arbor public school system.</p>

            <p>Boal contains his correspondence files plus subject files which he considered unneeded for reference by his successor. The correspondence focuses on the administration of Interlochen, including the name change for the Camp and the successful fund-raising necessitated by a cut in state aid. His interchanges with Jacobi show his view of developments at Interlochen, and his correspondence with alumni leader, Gerilyn Turner, reveal the tensions inherent in attempts at institutional change. The subject files emphasize developments at Interlochen's three major units: the radio station (WIAA), the Academy, and the Camp.</p>

          <p>The Boards series covers Interlochen's support and governing bodies: Board of Advisors, Board of Control, and Board of Directors/Trustees. Advisory served in a consulting and fund-raising capacity from the Camp's founding until the early 1970's while Control oversaw its financial operations through the payment of early creditors in 1943. The Board of Directors, whose name was officially changed to Trustees in 1944, constituted the official governing body throughout Interlochen's history.</p>
          <p>The Board of Advisors dates to the Camp's founding and continued through World War II. In 1960, as Maddy was planning the Academy, he revived it, and in 1965, expanded it to cover all operations. During the early 1970's, as the Board of Trustees membership was significantly increased, it apparently became moribund. While operating, it provided counsel, recruited students, and in particular, aided fund-raising. In the 1960's, Karl Haas served as its head before becoming president of Interlochen.</p>

            <p>The advisory board records consist mainly of correspondence for 1940-1945 and 1960-1969. Maddy and board co-chairs, Peter Dykema and Mrs. R. B. Canfield, dominate the early period, and Maddy, Merrill, and Haas the later. While much of the material relates to meeting arrangements, some elaborates on Interlochen developments as well as personal subjects.</p>
            <p>Letters of advisory board members dealing with non-board business can also be found in the Special Correspondence of the Chronological series. In addition, the Board of Trustees subseries contains correspondence from some former advisory board members (especially from the 1960's). Since fund-raising constituted a major focus of the advisory board throughout its history. researchers should also consult that topic in the Subject Interlochen and Post-Maddy Administrators Haas series.</p>

            <p>While the Board of Advisors provided support, the Board of Control oversaw the Camp's financial operations from 1928 until 1943. It represented the interests of the early creditors, especially the debenture holders, a large proportion of whom came from the Traverse City area. Willis Pennington, from whom the Camp property was purchased, played a major role in its deliberations. When the initial debt was retired in 1943, the Board of Control ceased to exist.</p>
            <p>Its few surviving records, 1928-1942, consist of correspondence, papers, and reports of a financial nature. They include the contractual arrangements for the first Camp broadcasts, 1930. Researchers will also want to consult: the Pennington family materials in Chronological Camp History, the Tremaine correspondence in Chronological Camp files, and the debenture files in Subject Interlochen -"Fund raising."</p>

            <p>The Board of Directors/Trustees served as Interlochen's official governing body from its beginning. Rather than being incorporated by the state legislature, Maddy, Giddings, and Pennington formed an association with themselves as members. The members and board were synonymous, but to satisfy legal requirements, the former met annually in advance of the board to add or delete from their number and hear reports. The board session which followed made the policy decisions. Members serving in their capacity on the Board were called Directors until 1944, when the Camp formally altered its name and bylaws, making them Trustees.</p>
            <p>As long as Maddy was president, the Board remained relatively small, and much business, particularly in the early years, was conducted on an informal basis. In 1930, Tremaine replaced Pennington on the three person Board, and a year later, Howard Hanson was added. During the late 1930's and early 1940's, it expanded to seven members with the inclusion of Franklin Dunham (1938), Judith Waller (1941), and J. Joseph Herbert (1942), the latter representing the University of Michigan. In 1943, W. W. Charters replaced Hanson. When first Giddings and then Tremaine became less active, Maddy was able to shape the board more to his liking. Although newcomers were added, it remained less than a dozen members until Maddy's death.</p>
            <p>Following Maddy's passing, the Board underwent a rapid expansion. At Haas' resignation in 1970, it had twenty-two members, and at Jacobi's retirement in 1989, forty-one. As the board grew, much of its work was done by committees. The first, an executive committee, was formed, apparently in the late 1940's, to act in the Board's behalf between meetings. Under Maddy's successors, the number of committees handling specific subjects proliferated.</p>
            <p>The Trustee/Director records are by far the most extensive and complete of the three Interlochen Boards. They are divided into two sections:(1) correspondence and papers, 1928-1988, and (2) minutes and reports, 1930-89. The former includes some supporting documents, and the latter many reports used in decision making.</p>

            <scopecontent>
              <p>The "correspondence and papers" (1), 1928-1988, is divided chronologically into files for (a) Maddy, 1928-1966, (b) the Administrative Committee, 1966-1967, Haas, 1967-1970, (d) acting president Wilson, 1970-71, and (e) Jacobi, 1971-88. The correspondence consists of exchanges between the Trustees and Interlochen officers, especially the president, president's secretary, treasurer, and board secretary. Everything directly relates to board business. Correspondence of a private nature or about Interlochen in general usually can be found elsewhere.</p>
              <p>The Maddy segment (a), 1928-1966, is organized chronologically except for a concluding alphabetical file for significant Trustees, 1959-1966. The latter includes Roscoe Bonisteel, who became chairman of the board after Maddy's death, and Clement Stone, the philanthropist who endowed the Academy. Other than an occasional letter from Maddy's secretary (Stace) or the Camp treasurer (largely Tremaine), Maddy handled almost all the surviving early Trustee correspondence. Additional communications from Trustees can be found under Giddings and Tremaine in the Chronological Camp files, 1935-1966, and especially under Dunham and Waller in Special Correspondence. With the appointment of Board secretaries Roger Jacobi, 1956-1959, and John Merrill, 1959-1969, correspondence with trustees increased markedly. Merrill was especially active in maintaining contact with them.</p>
              <p>The Administrative Committee portion , 1966-1967, (b) provides much of the surviving documentation on the operation of Interlochen immediately after Maddy's death, including the selection of his successor. It also helps illuminate the fund-raising efforts of the era. Merrill, as committee secretary, and Stace, as a committee member and Maddy's long-time aide, dominate the Trustee correspondence.</p>
              <p>Haas' files, 1967-1970, largely reflect his personal dealings with the board but also include letters from Merrill and Stace. During the Haas presidency, six new trustees were appointed, and the President of the Interlochen Alumni Association (David E. Klein until 1970) became an ex officio member. Two of the seven new trustees, Klein and Eugene Power, previously served with Haas on the Advisory Board.</p>
              <p>Files for the Wilson acting presidency (d), 1970-1971, contain some of the best information available on the administration of Interlochen between Haas' resignation and Jacobi's appointment. They include materials on the reaction to the resignation, particularly at the Academy, and the presidential selection process.</p>
              <p>The Jacobi files (e), 1971-1988, are alphabetically organized, reflecting the expansion of the board under his presidency. Correspondence from his first few months in office is lacking, and the files of many important board members end currently in 1984, including with Clement Stone. The latter became chairman upon Roscoe Bonisteel's death in 1972 and played an important role throughout the Jacobi presidency. Jacobi handled almost all the correspondence himself. In a letter to Stone of September 22, 1980, he elaborates on his achievements as president.</p>

              <p>"Minutes and reports" (2), 1930-1989, include minutes and supporting documents such as reports of the president and other officers. The Board met at least once a year both as Members and as Trustees and often created separate sets of minutes for each unit it administered: Camp (1928 on), Academy (1961 on), College (1969 on), and Center (1969 on). Beginning in the 1960's, preliminary drafts of minutes are also included. Executive committee minutes, starting in 1947, are fairly extensive, but the work of other committees is poorly documented.</p>
              <p>Maddy began writing his presidential reports in advance for distribution to Board members, a tradition which was continued until Jacobi. The latter made his orally, but starting around 1981, his hand-written notes are extant. Treasurer's reports used by the Board, 1969-88, are located in Subject Interlochen "Financial."</p>
              <p>From 1930 through 1947, only scattered minutes and reports have survived. Although the 1948-1955 file appears complete, it was marked "incomplete." From 1956 through 1963, there is a good run of trustee minutes, including some of its executive committee, and president's reports.</p>
              <p>From November 1963 on, the documentation consists mainly of packets of materials, including minutes, reports, and supporting information, distributed to board meeting participants. Until 1979, the packets are labeled mainly as belonging to George Wilson and thereafter, Roger Jacobi. Also included are materials (1969-1972) gleaned from the Eugene Power papers which help document the transition from Haas to Jacobi, particularly Power's suggestion for Academy governance and his service on the Ad Hoc Committee and the Trustees Study Commission.</p>
              <p>Except for a gap from Wilson's retirement in 1979 until 1981, the packets appear complete. Wilson occasionally made notes in his, and Jacobi included (in the front pockets) his hand-written remarks to the board. The last, July 22, 1989, contains Jacobi's valedictory to the board in which he reviewed his accomplishments as president.</p>

          <p>The Previously Closed portion series of manuscripts, which opened to researchers in 1998, was selected by Peg Stace, Maddy's long-time assistant, in preparing the bulk of the collection for placement here. It mainly covers the period 1938-1970, emphasizing the Maddy and Haas presidencies. It covers: Maddy's personal/family concerns, administrative disagreements, personnel matters, and reference to ethnic, religious, and racial groups which, though common in the past, are no longer socially acceptable. Most series and many subseries are represented. Major portions concern: Maddy's communications with Giddings (1939-1953) and Tremaine (1938-1959); Gillis' correspondence (1958-1961); University of Michigan letters, agreements, and reports (1954-1961); and minutes and reports on the Haas presidency, especially his dealings with the Board of Trustees (1967-1970).</p>

          <p>The Printed series, 1927-1996, is divided into Interlochen Publications and Published Articles. Both offer good coverage of the Camp and the Academy from their beginnings through the Jacobi presidency (1989) and in some cases beyond. Researchers will find Subject Interlochen"Publicity/Promotion" useful for background information.</p>

            <p>Interlochen Publications, covering mainly 1928-1988, contains sections on (1) the Camp, (2) Interlochen, and (3) the Academy. The Camp (1) features its concert programs (called <title render="italic">The Scherzo</title> until 1938) which are complete from 1928 through 1988 (the mimeographed sheets used in 1942 being photocopies). Other major Camp items include announcements for the Allstate and University Divisions and student publications. Interlochen (2) contains informational and promotional materials covering both the Camp and Academy. The <title render="italic">Prelude</title> (1938-1989) and posters (mainly 1941-1989) originally dealt only with the Camp but later incorporated the Academy. More recent works combining both include the <title render="italic">Crescendo</title> (1964-1993), a newsletter for Interlochen alumni and friends. Academy materials (3) encompass catalogues (1961-1984), student publications (1967-1971), and programs covering performances (1962-1988), commencements (1963-1989), and festivals (mainly 1977-1982).</p>
            <p>Researchers will also find Interlochen publications located elsewhere in the collection. Chronological Camp History contains histories. Subject Interlochen includes promotional materials on "Fund-raising," "Interlochen Press," and "Special Events" while Subject Camp contains items on the Interlochen List and Library Catalogue as well as some programs.</p>

            <p>Published Articles, largely 1927-1978, contain newspaper and magazine accounts about Interlochen mainly from its origins through its fiftieth anniversary celebration. It includes virtually every major overview article published on the Camp and Academy as well as some on faculty and staff. Other articles can be found in the Subject series under Maddy, Giddings and Tremaine, and Interlochen "Petrillo Controversy." Researchers should also check the specialized topics "prison camp" in Interlochen "Michigan and "air force base" in Interlochen "U.S. Government." Since Maddy or the publicity staff prepared many of the articles, background information on them can sometimes be found in the manuscript series: Chronological Camp Files, 1935-1945 under "Publicity" as well as in Subject Maddy"Publications" and Subject Interlochen "Publicity/Promotion." The Scrapbooks provide a good supplement to the articles, especially for individual Campers and staff.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series includes photographic prints, negatives, and glass slides, and motion picture films and negatives. They offer especially good coverage of Maddy's life and the Camp's early years as well as a sampling of later events and personages.</p>
          <p>Interlochen maintains its own photographic and audio archives which offer more extensive coverage, particularly for more recent events. Much of the Interlochen holdings remain in active use for publicity, rebroadcast, and listening purposes. For information about them, researchers should contact the photo archive, music library, or radio station (WIAA) at Interlochen.</p>
          <p>Photographs consist of prints (including a few postcards), negatives, and glass slides. They cover both Maddy's career and Interlochen's history. Since the two are closely interrelated, researchers interested in one should check the other. The Interlochen images were taken by both staff members and professional photographers. Documentation about professionals can be found under "photography" in Chronological Camp files, 1935-1945. Often, the images were used for publicity purposes in publications by, or articles about, Interlochen.</p>
          <p>The Prints (1), circa 1880-1986, has separate descriptions for regular and outsized images, including sections on Maddy, the National High School Orchestra, the Early Camp, Later Camp/Academy, and Later Administrators.</p>

            <p>The Maddy portion, circa 1880-1967, features his parents, brother, family homes, boyhood friends, recreational activities, and major events in his professional career, including his broadcasting, conducting, and other music education endeavors. They also cover his work at Interlochen, including scenes of him with many prominent guests. The prints begin before his birth and conclude a year after his death (with the sculptured bust presented to Interlochen in his memory). Volumes 3 and 4 of the Scrapbooks, 1938-1940, also contain images of Maddy.</p>
            <p>Closely related to both Maddy and the Camp are scenes of the National High School Orchestra. They cover its appearances, 1926-1930 and 1938. The last, a special revival for the MENC convention in St. Louis, Missouri, with Joseph Maddy presiding, celebrated the centennial of music education in America.</p>

            <p>The early Camp segment, mainly 1927-1942, was created by staff members and professional photographers (who visited the Camp to take publicity and group pictures for a fee). It begins with the construction of the Camp and covers faculty, guest conductors, staff, Campers, performances, buildings and grounds, recreation, and other aspects of Camp life. It includes photos of early Camp leaders Thaddeus Giddings, Willis Pennington, and C. M. Tremaine and performers Walter Damrosch, Frederick Fennell, Percy Grainger, Ferde Grofe, Howard Hanson, Lorin Maazel, John Philip Sousa, and Frederick Stock. Researchers should check the name card index for the location of images of prominent individuals. Photographic prints of the construction of the Camp can also be found Volume 1 of the Scrapbooks. The 25th anniversary pictorial history of the Camp done in 1952 serves as a handy guide to many early events and personages.</p>

            <p>The later Camp/Academy portion, largely 1948-1984, is far less extensive. In 1942, having built a darkroom, Interlochen began maintaining its own photo archives. Although some later prints have been added through manuscript accessions, the archives at Interlochen remains the best source of photographs on its recent history.</p>
            <p>Despite the limitations of the post-1942 prints, they include some interesting images. They cover Van Cliburn's and Luci Baines Johnson's appearances, Alden Dow's architectural work, C.S. Mott's building dedication, and Werner von Braun's visit with his Camper daughter as well as the ISME meeting with participants Norman Dello Joio, Demitri Kabalevsky, and Zoltan Kodaly.</p>

            <p>Prints of later administrators, mainly 1957-1978, came with their papers. Wilson's (1930-1978) include a few images of him as an early Camper and as a civic music conductor. Most emphasize his activities as Camp Director, including the visit of Mrs. Imelda Marcos and the dedication of the National Music Camp of the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Don Gillis' photos (circa 1959) highlight his work for Interlochen. They include scenes of American Opera Theatre productions and the visit of American Federation of Musicians officials, which ended the Petrillo controversy.</p>
            <p>The Administrative Committee is shown in session, circa 1966-1967 while the Karl Haas' images, 1967, focus on his selection and inauguration as President of Interlochen. The latter show Haas meeting with members of the Administrative Committee and Board of Trustees and being installed as President.</p>
            <p>Though few in number, Jacobi's photographs (1975-1986) include images of him and his staff with George Wilson (1978) and of President and Mrs. Gerald Ford's visit to Interlochen (1975).</p>

          <p>Less than 100 photographic Negatives (2), circa 1931-1938, are included in the collection (two others made from our print holdings are part of the library's negative files). All are nitrate and date from the 1930's. Six show Maddy's radio band classes at the U. of M. (in studio and on campus), circa 1931-1937.</p>
          <p>The remainder (91) were apparently taken of Camp activities during the summer of 1938. Some of them were used in article about the Camp which appeared in the musical journal <title render="italic">True Tone</title>, in the fall 1938 (a copy of which is included with the negatives) and subsequent Camp publications. They show activities of Campers, adult visitors, and guests as well as an appearance by the Camp band and orchestra at the National Cherry Festival in Traverse City, July 13-15, 1938. Maddy probably took most of them since he appears in only one. Seven of the images have prints (see 1), all apparently from 1938: one of Maddy speaking at Interlochen and six of other Camp scenes.</p>

          <p>The Glass Slides (3), circa 1923-1931, consist of some 182 mainly colored images on 4x5 plates. A short name and subject index serves as an introduction for researchers. Over half the slides show scenes from the Camp, circa 1928-1931, plus some of the National High School Orchestra. The remainder concern music education in general. Until Maddy switched to movies, he probably used them in his Camp and music education lectures. Since the U. of M. Extension Service sponsored many of his talks, researchers may find information about them in Subject Maddy "University of Michigan." The slides housed in two slide boxes (boxes 76 and 77) and arranged by slide number. In this finding aid the slides have grouped by broad subject categories and then alphabetically by title or description.</p>

          <p>Motion Picture Films, circa 1930-1938, consist of 16 millimeter silent footage, both prints and negatives, probably taken by Maddy. A name index at the beginning of each portion will help guide researchers. With two exceptions (a Cherry Festival parade and Maddy's personal life), all are in black and white of Camp activities. Included are early promotional movies of the Camp based on privately shot footage, for which continuity was done commercially. In 1939, with funds provided by the State of Michigan, Camp films began being produced in sound by professionals. All the latter remain in the possession of Interlochen as is a copy of the 1940 Paramount film, "There's Magic in Music." Information about the various Camp promotional films can be found in Chronology Camp files, 1935-1945, under "publicity-movies" and in Subject Interlochen "Publicity" under "Internal" and in Subject Interlochen "Michigan" under "General/Legislature."</p>

          <p>The Sound Recordings series consists of Audio Tapes and Record Discs circa 1922-86 and relate to Maddy's life and Camp/Interlochen history. The Maddy portion contains his reminiscences for a proposed a biography (1958) and a WOOD (Grand Rapids) retrospective on his life (1966). It also includes his talk to the American Association of University Women (undated) and recordings of his Richmond High School orchestra from the early 1920's. In addition, there are many discs of Maddy's instructional lessons from the 1930's.</p>
          <p>The Camp/Interlochen segment features George Wilson's talk (1986) on the institution's history and a WEFM (Chicago) interview (undated) with Thor Johnson, the early Camp conductor and Academy director. It also includes an early performance of "Les Preludes" (circa 1930's), the White House concert (1962), performances conducted by Cliburn and Maddy (1964), Interlochen promotional recordings (1971 and 1973), the concert for President Ford (1975), the dedication ceremonies for the Grand Traverse Performing Arts Center (1975), and 50th anniversary releases (1977).</p>

          <p>Fifty-one Scrapbooks (1928-1930, 1938-1940, and 1944-1978) help document the history of Interlochen and its leaders, especially Joseph Maddy. Arranged in rough chronology, they mainly contain newspaper and magazine articles, but a few include photos and manuscript items. Researchers will also want to make reference to the Printed Published Articles subseries, especially for the missing years. The scrapbooks offer a more comprehensive coverage of individual Campers and faculty, which should prove useful in documenting the growing importance of African-Americans on campus and other specialized projects. A detailed inventory of the Scrapbooks provides information on the contents of the individual volumes. The scrapbooks since 1978 have been retained by Interlochen.</p>

              <p>(The volume follows the roughly chronological, Camp/Academy pattern. Some of the articles are starting to loosen from the pages. Mention is made (May 1977) of the state arts budget coming under attack.)</p>

              <p>(The volume offers a somewhat chronological coverage of articles about the Camp and Academy. It mainly deals with 1977 which is the fiftieth anniversary of the Camp. The same articles often appear in many papers, so small tabs containing the name of each paper are included. The pages are starting to adhere, and the tabs should begin to fall soon.)</p>
