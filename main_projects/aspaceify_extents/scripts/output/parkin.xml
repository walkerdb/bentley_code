    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>William C. Parkinson was born February 11, 1918 in Jarvis, Ontario. He received his BSE (1940), Master's (1941), and Ph.D. (1948), all in physics, from the University of Michigan. His professional association with the University of Michigan began in 1936 when he became a research assistant. In 1942, he left Ann Arbor to become a physicist at the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins University. He also worked at Johns Hopkins' Office of Science Research and Development in 1943-44. Parkinson returned to the University of Michigan in 1946 as a research fellow. In 1947 he joined the faculty as an instructor and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1948 then to professor in 1958. From 1962 to 1977, Parkinson also was the director of the cyclotron laboratory on the Ann Arbor campus.</p>
      <p>The cyclotron was an "atom-smasher" that accelerated particles to relatively high energy, and was a principal instrument for research in nuclear structure physics. The University of Michigan cyclotron program dates back to 1935 when what was then the largest cyclotron in the world was constructed. The facility was remodeled and updated in 1950 with help from the UM Phoenix Project. In 1960, a grant from the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as well as $1.1 million from the Michigan State Legislature provided for the construction of the University-owned building to house both the original 42-inch cyclotron and a new 83-inch cyclotron.</p>
      <p>Parkinson has had four patents issued which are associated with various research projects. These include a method and apparatus for measuring the velocity of a projectile (1961), method and apparatus for remotely controlling an airborne vehicle (1950), and two versions of an automatic timing and sequence-indicating system used in swimming (1966, 1967).</p>
      <p>His swim judging and timing system came from his own love of the sport and his experiences as a timer at Michigan swimming meets. He felt that the human factor in timing and judging led to too many disputes and uncertainties. His impressions were borne out when there was a controversial decision in the outcome of the 100-meter men's freestyle race in the 1960 Olympics. A more universal need for an accurate system led to more interest in the system Parkinson had been working on since 1958 with Michigan swim coach Gus Stager. Parkinson's system used two electrical circuits and contact plates. The timing circuit, started by the sharp report of the starting gun, was stopped by the first contact plate being touched. The judging circuit gave the order or sequence of finish. "Touch pads" were lowered into the pool at the last lap for swimmers to make contact with and record the times. The system effectively eliminated the human link, except for the placing of the contact pads, and was unaffected by waves and splash.</p>
      <p>Parkinson served on various professional and university committees during his lifetime, which highlight his own varied professional and personal interests. He was named a Fulbright Scholar (1952-53) and served as a consultant for Oak Ridge National Lab (1955-1960), Los Alamos National Lab (1958-60), and Argonne National Lab (1959-60). His membership on various university committees ranged from the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics to Rackham Divisional Board policies and the Biophysics Research Division Executive Committee.</p>
      <p>Parkinson retired on May 31, 1988, was appointed Professor Emeritus, and was reappointed to active status for Fall 1989. Parkinson passed away on March 19, 2012.</p>

      <p>The William C. Parkinson Papers consist of 5.25 linear feet of documents relating to the professional career of physics professor William C. Parkinson, spanning years 1950 through 1990 with the bulk of the material dating from 1950 to 1980. The papers were received in two major accession in July 1991 and May 2012.</p>
      <p>The first accession was broken into five series: Cyclotron, Physics Department, Professional Organizations, Swimming Judging and Timing System, and University Committees. There is also a folder entitled "Biographical/Historical Information" at the beginning of the collection which includes a 1974 vita and a publication on the cyclotron laboratory of which Parkinson was director.</p>
      <p>The 2012 Accession included additions to the Cyclotron and Physics Department series and two new series: Consulting and Visual Materials.</p>

            <p>Cyclotron, 1950-1983 (1.3 linear feet) includes material on the research projects and administration of the cyclotron laboratory, and reflect the growth of the laboratory and the various research projects, especially with the 83-inch cyclotron. The series includes correspondence with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), laboratory annual reports, progress reports, and proposals. The AEC correspondence reflects Parkinson's order which accounts for the overlap of dates. The "Equipment Disposal" folder includes a written "History of the Cyclotron Disposal" that describes the dismantling of the laboratory and dispersal of equipment following the 1977 decision to close the laboratory due to lack of funding. Also of interest to the researcher will be the folder entitled "Newspaper Clippings and Photographs." The materials capture some of the building activities and remodeling of the laboratory that took place in 1960 and 1961. This series is comprised of materials received in the first accession and is continued in the 2012 accession.</p>

            <p>Physics Department, 1964-1986 (0.4 linear feet) reflects Parkinson's participation in the physics department administration and professorial duties as well as cyclotron information. The eight folders entitled "Correspondence" include a file index for each year. Included in the "History of Physics" folder is a copy of the paper Parkinson wrote in 1986 regarding the history of nuclear physics at the University of Michigan. Like the Cyclotron series, this series is continued in the 2012 accession.</p>

            <p>Physics Department, 1938-1997 (1.2 linear feet), arranged alphabetically, extends the series from the first accession. The new accession consists primarily of correspondence and teaching materials. Also included are records regarding Parkinson's sabbaticals and international work in China and the United Kingdom. Of particular interest is "Notes Concerning the Far Infra Red Vacuum Recording Spectrograph", a laboratory notebook written by Nelson Fuson, a physicist and conscientious objector during World War II.</p>

          <p>In the Swimming Judging and Timing System series, 1955-1978 (0.4 linear feet), information on Parkinson's invention can be found. Correspondence regarding the methods he used can be found here as well as responses from other companies and schools who tested out his system. The "Patent Information" folders include material on references to his system and correspondence regarding royalty problems. The original patent information can be found in the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics record group in the Bentley Library. In the "Correspondence" files, there are drawings of various components of the timing system with references to their operation. Photographs of the system are located in Visual Materials.</p>

          <p>Parkinson's involvement with University of Michigan committees is well-documented in the University Committees series, 1955-1987 (0.25 linear feet). Committees ranging from athletics to academic policies to research policies are covered. In the "Sigma Xi, Michigan Chapter" folder, handwritten introductions and speeches Parkinson made while serving as president can be found. Many of the committees are documented in other Bentley collections.</p>
