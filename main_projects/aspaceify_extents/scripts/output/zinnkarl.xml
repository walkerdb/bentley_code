      <abstract>Karl L. Zinn, a specialist in computer-assisted instruction, joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1963 as a research associate with the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching. Promoted to research scientist in 1969, Zinn was instrumental in establishing the MERIT computer network and developing CONFER, the first computer-based conferencing systems on campus. Papers document the development and utilization of CONFER and contain extensive examples of print-outs of conferences, particularly those relating to the use of computers in instruction. Topical files chronicle various technological issues, including the development of MERIT and early uses of computers in the classroom.</abstract>

      <p>Karl L. Zinn joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1963 as a research associate in the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) and as a lecturer in psychology. Zinn was promoted to research scientist in 1969 and maintained this title until he retired from active faculty status in 1997. Zinn joined the Information Technology Division in 1995.</p>
      <p>Zinn received his B.A. degree from Swarthmore College in 1959 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1962 and 1964, respectively. Zinn's first work assignment in CRLT was to assist faculty with problems related to testing and evaluation of computer technology for classroom use. Zinns work in this area soon led to him being identified as one of the "best informed individuals in America in the area of computer-assisted instruction, establishing connections with other research centers and setting up demonstration projects using access to the experimental computer systems at IBM, Dartmouth and the University of Illinois."[1] Other significant accomplishments include writing a proposal to the State of Michigan for a possible shared information network to be used among major universities. This proposal resulted in a planning grant for a state-wide computing network. Zinn also authored the proposal to the National Science Foundations that led to the development of the MERIT (Michigan Education and Research Information Triad) computer network in 1966. Zinn was named an associate director of MERIT in 1969.[2]</p>
      <p>Zinn is also credited for introducing computer graphics to the University of Michigan; putting the first interactive programming language on the Michigan Terminal System; programming simulations and academic games for instruction; and setting up the first computer-based conferencing system, CONFER, on campus.[3]</p>
      <p>CONFER was developed in the mid-1970s when experimental psychology graduate student Bob Parnes attended a seminar which Professor Merrill Flood discussed aspects of electronic mail and conferencing on group decision making. Professor Flood had a prototype of such a program and approached Parnes to modify the application for MTS but, Parnes was interested in developing a program from the ground up.[4] With the support of the University, particularly the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, CONFER was developed.</p>
      <p>Parnes' vision of the system was one where the individual group participant would alternate between being a producer and being a consumer of information. The unique CONFER feature in this regard was initially the functionality of the "vote." This feature allowed the consumer to voice their "feelings" or opinion on a statement by voting. Initially, responses were limited in size.</p>
      <p>The first major "test" for the CONFER system was the October 1976 International Society for Technology Assessment (ISTA) Conference held in Ann Arbor. Zinn was interested in testing the technology to facilitate the coordination of tasks among the conference staff as well as using the system to allow conference participants to extend discussions on conference topics. CONFER provided a new opportunity for group discussion and is credited for playing a "tremendous role in enlarging the electronic community" at the University of Michigan.[5]</p>
      <p>CONFER continued to gain in popularity with faculty, students, administrators and staff through the 1980s. By 1991, a group of students established the first computer conference for exclusively for students called MEET: STUDENTS. This very popular conference marked, in a sense, the acceptance of online communications as a culturally accepted mode for student communication and exchange.</p>
      <p>For many on campus, the benefits of CONFER included meeting new people with similar interests, engaging in group discussion, and communicating outside the normal parameters defined by time and space. The CONFER system continued to be a widely used communication tool until 1999. By this time, the university had moved from the Michigan Terminal System to a distributed computing environment and several newer digital technologies replaced the functionality provided by CONFER.

            <p>The CONFER Sessions subseries is comprised of paper printouts from a subset of computer-based conferences that ran on the University of Michigan mainframe computing system (Michigan Terminal System) from 1975 to 1994. These were printed by Zinn, and are indicative of his involvement and interests. This subseries provides an informative view of the introduction, evolution and use of a new technology designed specifically to support computer-based communications. The subseries includes RP.CONFER the original conference that utilized the CONFER I application program; student administered conferences; conferences used to supplement class discussion; and a series of conferences designed for the International Science and Technology Assessment Congress held in Ann Arbor in 1976. The CONFER Sessions subseries is divided into Public Conferences and University of Michigan Class Conferences. Access to the latter is restricted in accord with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.</p>
            <p>The CONFER paper printouts are essentially a static snapshot of an asynchronous communications system. The term "snapshot" is used as the original functionality of the CONFER II system are features that could not be replicated in the paper printouts. In addition, not all entries, once posted within the system, could be captured in the paper printout as some entries were time-dependent and were deleted on a specific schedule. Lastly, the interactive nature of CONFER can not be adequately captured in a static document. As Zinn describes in a welcome message, literally "hundreds of participants passed by this electronic bulletin board from day to day."7 A sense of the features and the evolution of the use and functionality of the system can be gained by consulting the User Reference Documentation series and Robert Parnes' dissertation. The features and use of the technology can also be realized through some of the CONFERS themselves. Robert Parnes used CONFER as a testbed and one will often see Parnes "step" into a particular session to query users about the functionality of specific features and to announce changes to the system.</p>
            <p>CONFER printouts are available in two sizes. For the most part, conferences dating from 1975 to about 1980 were printed on 15" x 11" paper, and conferences dating after 1980 were printed on standard 8 1/2" x 11" paper. For the larger sized conferences, the cover sheet of the printout includes the job number that produced the conference report, the system source, and the date and time the report was generated. Later printouts do not include all of this information but do include the date the session was printed to paper.</p>
            <p>Entries within conferences generally include the item number, date and time, number of lines for a particular entry, author, subject line and a calculation of the number of related items on this topic within the conference. Many of the conferences include an index of topics discussed and a directory of participants. The index is generally found at the start of the conference and the directory of participants at the end. In addition, many conferences also include as one of the first entries a welcome message from the conference organizer that includes a brief description of the purpose of the conference. CONFER II and later CONFER U were in use at the University of Michigan from 1975 until September 1, 1999. A summary of the CONFER sessions located in this collection appears below.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series (6 linear feet, 1964-1997) includes a substantial amount of information on MERIT, MICIS (Michigan Inter-University Committee on Information Systems), Project EXTEND (Extending University Computing Resources into College Learning Activities) and the University Committee on Computer Policy and Utilization (UCCPU). The files in this series are arranged alphabetically. In addition, the subseries is valuable for the range of grant proposals, reports and other initiatives Zinn was involved in during this time period to learn about and integrate the use of microcomputers in education. Zinn includes additional context for many of the project files found within this series by his use of "notes" to the file. These notes, generally hand-written, are typically the first document located within a file.</p>

        <head>Summary of CONFER Session print-outs</head>
        <p>This list was compiled using similar lists located in the manuscripts and by reading through the purpose statements for many of the CONFER sessions. Note that over time, certain conventions evolved within CONFER including a brief welcome message that included a statement on the scope of the conference.</p>
        <p>The names given for the CONFERs were based on a scheme that aimed to start all class conferences with a sequence of numbers (e.g. 2Q1A:Argue) and that included CRLT as the pre-fix for all conferences facilitated by Center for Learning and Teaching staff. Other conventions draw on the use of acronyms (e.g. CAP for Computer Assistance Program of the Political Science Department, ISTA for International Science Technology Assessment) and other abbreviations such as TA for Technology Assessment, Word for Microsoft Word, and MICRO for Microcomputers.</p>
