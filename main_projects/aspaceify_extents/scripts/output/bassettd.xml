    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Born September 7, 1928 in Taunton, Massachusetts, David R. Bassett has been active in pacifist movements, particularly conscientious objection to military taxation, for most of his life. After earning a bachelor's degree in social relations from Harvard College in 1949, Bassett pursued medical training at Tufts University, which he completed in 1953. A registered conscientious objector, Bassett participated in the Alternative Service program, providing health care in rural India from 1955 to 1957. Bassett's experiences in India fostered an interest in preventive medicine. Bassett returned to the United States to complete residency and fellowship training in Philadelphia, where he became a specialist in preventive cardiovascular disease. Bassett served as co-director and director of the Hawaii Cardiovascular Study at Queens Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii, from 1963 to 1968, when he joined the Division of Hypertension at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Bassett retired from his position there as chief of the hyperlipidemia program in 1994.</p>
      <p>Bassett, who was brought up in the Congregational Church, first began attending meetings of the Society of Friends while a student at Harvard. In 1950, after graduating, Bassett served with the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) in Mexico. During his years in medical school, Bassett often worked with the AFSC weekend work camps in Boston, and later completed his alternative service in India under the auspices of the AFSC. In 1960, along with his wife, Miyoko Inouye, Bassett formally joined the strongly pacifist faith.</p>
      <p>Bassett's convictions led him to become active in the anti-Vietnam War effort during his time in Hawaii. After moving to Ann Arbor, Bassett became increasingly involved in peace-related activities through the Ann Arbor Friends. The U.S. Peace Tax Fund Bill (originally the World Peace Tax Fund Bill), grew out of concern that registration with the government as a conscientious objector did not prevent Bassett's taxes from supporting an ever-growing defense budget. Bassett had already begun working for change on an individual level by deciding to withhold war taxes, but felt that the cause would be more effectively advanced through a legislative route. With the help of University of Michigan Law School Professor Joseph Sax and law student Michael Hall, Bassett drafted the peace tax fund bill. Another University of Michigan professor, Robert Lind of the School of Social Work, assisted by making contacts in the U.S. Congress, particularly members of the Black Caucus and other followers of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Representative Ronald Dellums, of California agreed to sponsor the bill, which was first introduced on tax day April 15, 1972. The bill was not introduced in the Senate until 1977, when Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon agreed to sponsor the initiative.</p>
      <p>The National Council for a World Peace Tax Fund (NCWPTF), which began as a small group of supporters in the Ann Arbor area, became, by 1975, an organized campaign on a national level, with a full-time paid staff and offices in Washington D.C. Bassett, after serving for a year as the organization's first chairperson, was named honorary national chairperson in 1976. While other organizations protesting military taxation concentrated on tax resistance and other forms of civil disobedience, Bassett's group focused on a legislative solution to the problem. As stated in the Peace Tax Fund Bill that share of taxes which would ordinarily go to the defense budget could be diverted instead to a special fund if the taxpayer was a registered conscientious objector. Congress would use the fund to foster peace-related activities. In 1985, as part of changes made to the bill in an effort to improve its prospects, the name was changed to the U.S. Peace Tax Fund Bill, and the NCWPTF became the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund (NCPTF). Efforts to pass the legislation continue to the present time.</p>

      <p>The David R. Bassett Papers document Bassett's activities in local and national peace-related organizations, most notably the peace tax fund movement from 1963 to 2002. The collection includes correspondence, minutes, agendas, memos, newspaper clippings, articles, interview transcripts, flyers, brochures, handouts, notes and newsletters, as well as a number of handbooks and manuals. The collection divides into four series. Pacifist Issues concern Bassett's peace-related activities. The next series, which makes up the bulk of the collection, contains the organizational records of the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund. The last two series are devoted to related groups, including Other Organizations based in the United States, or International groups devoted to peace tax funds or other peace-related causes.</p>

          <p>The Pacifist Issues series comprises materials collected and created by Bassett on a variety of pacifist issues, but primarily materials on war tax resistance and conscientious objection. The topical files include correspondence, notes, articles and newspaper clippings. The topical files are followed by a sub-series concerning legal cases, including briefs from trials of war-tax resisters. The next sub-series documents articles written by Bassett, and talks he gave, mainly on the Peace Tax Fund, to various groups around Michigan and the vicinity. A small sub-series contains interviews by and of Bassett, including one cassette tape, two VHS videotapes. There are also several photographs of Bassett and Congressman Ronald Dellums. The articles sub-series includes a draft, along with comments by readers, of "Affirm Life: Pay for Peace," a major article on the Peace Tax Fund, which was later published in <title render="italic">Handbook on Military Taxes &amp; Conscience</title>. A copy of the article can be found in the series, National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund, as part of its publications sub-series in Box 6. The Pacifist Issues series also includes issues of <title render="italic">The DePaul Law Review</title> and <title render="italic">Sojourners</title> with substantial articles on the Peace Tax Fund issue</p>

            <p>The chronological files comprise both NCPTF organizational records, and Bassett's personal notes and correspondence as honorary national chairperson. The chronological files contain correspondence, memos, notes, and agendas and minutes from meetings of NCPTF committees. These meetings include the steering committee from 1971 through 1984 (when the campaign was based in Ann Arbor), and the Board of Directors from 1985 to 2003. The 1985 folders document a series of major changes made in the bill, and its name change from World Peace Tax Fund Act to U.S. Peace Tax Fund Act. The folder titled "Legislation for Peace Tax Fund, 1971-1977" contains a rich collection of material documenting early efforts to acquire sponsorship for the fund in the U.S. House of Representatives. There is also a folder titled "Legislation preceding NCPTF (materials received from others), 1963-1969," which has materials from earlier war-tax resistance efforts.</p>

            <p>The topical files cover a variety of issues, such as the reaction of the Internal Revenue Service to the peace tax fund proposals, the campaign's fundraising efforts, and early drafts of the Peace Tax Fund Bill. There are notable folders concerning NCPTF bylaws and policies, and the experiences of individual war tax resisters (such as the parent/son letters of Bob Blood). The folder "Peace Tax Fund Bill, Congressional records, 1975-1991" contains copies of the official versions of the bill as well as excerpts from debate on the bill in the House and the Senate.</p>
