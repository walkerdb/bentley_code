      <abstract>William Albright--organist, composer, and University of Michigan faculty member--was born in Indiana in 1944 and died in 1998. Albright earned three music composition degrees from the University of Michigan before becoming a member of the composition faculty at the U. of M. School of Music. Albright is probably best known for his piano and organ performance. He helped to bring about a revival of ragtime, and sought inclusion of ragtime and other types of popular music in many of his compositions. He composed for many single instruments--especially the organ--and ensembles, and for orchestra. He also composed hymns, and was the music director for the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Ann Arbor, Michigan. He studied composition with Ross Lee Finney, George Rochberg, and Olivier Messiaen, among others, at Michigan and at summer workshops, and organ with Marilyn Mason. The collection includes biographical materials, correspondence, programs, professional files, University of Michigan School of Music files, and scores and recordings of William Albright works (including notes, sketches, and manuscripts) and works by his friends, students, and teachers.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>William Hugh Albright was born in Gary, Indiana in 1944. He received his early training at Juilliard and Eastman School of Music, and he earned three degrees from the University of Michigan: Bachelor of Music (Composition) in 1966, Master of Music (Composition) in 1967, and Doctor of Musical Arts (Composition) in 1970. He studied composition with Ross Lee Finney and Leslie Bassett at Michigan, with George Rochberg while he was at the University of Pennsylvania, and with Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatory in 1968-1969. He studied organ with Marilyn Mason at Michigan. He was married twice--to Sarah Ann (Kirk) Albright and Pamela Ann Decker--and had two children, John Kirk Albright and Elizabeth Mae Albright.</p>
      <p>Albright is probably best known for his piano and organ performances. He was recognized as a premier organist, performing throughout Europe and North America. He helped to bring about a revival of ragtime, in the vein of Scott Joplin and James P. Johnson, and he sought the inclusion of ragtime and other types of popular music in many of his modernist compositions.</p>
      <p>Albright was a prolific composer for many types of single instruments (especially the organ) and ensembles, and for orchestra. He also composed hymns, and was the music director for the First Unitarian-Universalist Church of Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
      <p>A member of the composition department faculty of the School of Music at the University of Michigan, he participated in a number of innovative projects, such as the famous Once Festival held in Ann Arbor, and the Electronic Music Laboratory.</p>
      <p>Albright composed Organbook I, Organbook II, and Organbook III for his principle instrument. They are some of his most popular works and were inspired by a work by one of his mentors, Olivier Messiaen, Livre d'Orgue.</p>
      <p>He composed during the sixties and seventies a number of works containing features associated with modernism, such as graphic notation and atonality. (See, for example, Tic and Organbook I.) By the early 1990s, Albright had distanced himself from "New Music" far enough to be less interested in making new music for the sake of the new, beginning to allow more conventional elements back into his works. Rustles of Spring, 1994 is an example of the directions he was taking near the end of his life. After 1994, Albright listed "The Four Expressions" that were represented by his works: aggression, sensuality, humor and spirituality. Take That for four drummers with 16 large drums (1972) he classified as aggression, "Fantasy-Mazurka" from Five Chromatic Dances for piano solo (1976) as sensuality, Doo-dah for three alto saxophones (1974) and King of Instruments for narrator and organ solo (1978) as humor, and Chasm: Symphonic Fragment for orchestra (1985-89) and "Recessional" from Organbook I for solo organ (1967) as spirituality. (William Albright Papers, Box 1, series "Biographical Materials," folder "Miscellaneous").</p>
      <p>The range of Albright's music is described in his entry in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians:</p>
      <p>"Although his early organ works reflect the influence of Messiaen in their colorful registration and chromaticism, Albright's later works often combine a complex rhythmic and atonal style with elements of American popular music. Though his works are formally concise, he stresses the value of music as communication and the supremacy in music of intuition, imagination and beauty of sound." (1980 ed. s.v. "Albright, William Hugh," by Don C. Gillespie.)</p>

          <p>The series Correspondence (1.8 linear feet) contains three sub-series: Chronological Files, Topical Files and Correspondence II. The file Correspondence II was accessioned separately from the rest of the correspondence. It apparently contains the bulk of Albright's professional correspondence relating to the exchange among composers of new works. However, all three files contain a mix of both professional and personal correspondence; in addition, small files of correspondence can be found interspersed throughout the collection. For instance, letters from composers (especially from former students) were occasionally kept along with the scores they had sent to Albright; these can be found in the series Scores. The folder of correspondence from William Bolcom was also accessioned separately--it was donated to the Bentley Historical Library by Bolcom in 1999.</p>

          <p>Albright tried to obtain copies of the programs from every performance by him, or of his works. These are retained in the series Programs (3.5 linear feet). The bulk of the programs are arranged chronologically; there are also four folders arranged geographically. The series also contains two folders of program notes arranged by song title, though more program notes are to be found among the programs themselves.</p>

          <p>The Professional Files series documents some of Albright's professional activities, including public lectures, participation in professional organizations, and publicity and reviews of his compositions, performances and recordings.</p>
          <p>The lectures are divided into "Lectures for the road," and Albright's opaque classifications "A" and "B."</p>
          <p>Some of the organizations with which Albright was professionally involved, and on which he kept files, are the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Ann Arbor, Great Lakes Performing Artist Associates, and Karen McFarlane Artists, Inc.</p>
          <p>The file titled Papers contains one paper by Albright, and ten by other authors about Albright. The researcher interested in papers about Albright should also consult the Reviews file in this series, as well as the files of Albright's individual works in the Scores series, where papers about a specific work are located.</p>
          <p>The Publicity files include correspondence and publicity flyers. The Reviews contains clippings arranged into composition, performance, publication and recording reviews.</p>

          <p>The Magic City (.25 linear feet) is an unfinished opera--set amid the 1893 Chicago World's Fair--that Albright planned for at least sixteen years with George Garrett, who helped write (or wrote) the libretto. The series contains files of Albright's notes, research materials and correspondence relating to work on the opera, as well as drafts of the libretto. In 1993 the University of Michigan Museum of Art organized an exhibition, "The Fair View: Alternative Visions of the World's Colombian Exposition," for which Albright gave a lecture/concert about music at the fair, and about the progress of The Magic City. A script of the lecture and correspondence pertaining to the exhibition can be found in this series. The series contains little musical material.</p>

            <p>In the sub-series William Albright Scores, the researcher will find a file for each of Albright's works containing some or all of the following versions: notes, sketches, manuscripts, annotated reproductions of manuscripts, and printed scores. The existing versions are parenthetically indicated following the instrumentation. The instrumentation--if not a part of the title itself--is indicated, in a general way, directly after the title. Dates are listed following the version information. When applicable, the titles of the movements are listed below. The existence of a sketch (or other version), which does not include one or more of the other movements, is indicated following the title of each movement that is included.</p>
            <p>Many of the sketches of Albright's works were kept separately from the rest of the musical texts, and have been incorporated here into the files of the respective titles. Unidentified sketches and fragments of sketches can be found at the end of the sub-series William Albright Scores.</p>

            <p>The next three sub-series--Piano Music, Organ Music and Various Composers--contain the unpublished or annotated scores from Albright's collection of works by his friends, teachers and students. The three divisions retain Albright's original arrangement, though Various Composers contains pieces for the piano and organ as well as the first two. One possible reason for the separation of these particular piano and organ pieces is that these are the works that he performed or planned to perform--many of the scores are annotated, and many of the titles are listed in his programs.</p>

          <p>In the series Recordings (22 boxes), the recordings are listed alphabetically--by song title in the sub-series William Albright Works, by album title in the sub-series Compact Discs and Long-Playing Albums, by type of music (e.g. keyboard or carillon, or works by other composers) in William Albright Performances, by title in William Albright Lectures, and by composer or performer in Other Composers/Performers. There are three media contained in the sub-series William Albright Works and Other Composers/Performers: audiocassettes, Digital Audio Tapes (DATs), and reels (5", 7", and 10 1/2"). The reels are boxed separately from the audiocassettes and DATs.</p>
          <p>Many of the audiocassettes and reels contain several works; sometimes by different composers. Of course, each audiocassette or reel can only be physically located in one place, so one audiocassette or reel may be referenced several times, under different titles. Here is an example of an entry:</p>
          <p>Some of the reels--both Albright works and those of other composers/performers--arrived at the Bentley Historical Library in 1999 contaminated with mold. These have been fumigated. After fumigation, the reels were reboxed, and the labels on the original boxes transcribed on a slip of paper and inserted into the new box with the reel. They have been boxed separately from the rest of the collection (in Boxes 78-81) as a precautionary measure. Though housed separately, the container list reflects the intellectual arrangement.</p>
