      <p>A widely recognized authority in the field of peace research, J. David Singer has been associated with the Political Science Department and the Mental Health Research Institute of the University of Michigan since the late 1950s. Noting the various facets of his career, he has written that "as a researcher, teacher, consultant and activist, my goal has been to bring rigorous scientific methods to bear on the cause of war question, and to encourage the integration of ethical concern and hard evidence."</p>
      <p>Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1925, J. David Singer received his B.A. from Duke University in 1946 and his Ph.D. from New York University in 1956. After serving as an instructor at N.Y.U. and Vassar College and as a visiting fellow in social relations at Harvard University, he came to the University of Michigan as a visiting assistant professor in political science in 1958. He became a senior scientist at the Mental Health Research Institute in 1960 and since 1965 he has also been a professor in the Political Science Department, becoming a Professor Emeritus in 2002. Singer served in the United States Navy as a deck officer at the end of World War II and during the Korean War. He has also worked as a consultant for the United States Department of State, U.S. Department of the Navy, U.S. Foreign Service Institute, Bendix Systems Division, and others.</p>
      <p>Singer was a member of Ann Arbor's Center for Research on Conflict Resolution, which formed in the mid-1950s. Organized by several prominent University of Michigan social scientists including Robert Angell (sociology), Kenneth Boulding (economics), and Daniel Katz (psychology), the center was an outgrowth of the <title render="italic">Journal of Conflict Resolution</title> founded in 1957 to encourage more vigorous research into the problems of achieving international peace. Faculty members associated with the center undertook research into such topics as military policy, arms control and disarmament. In 1963, Singer and the Mental Health Research Institute received a Carnegie grant to "review all international crises since the Napoleonic Wars with the aim of discriminating situations which were resolved in open wars and those which were settled by other means." One product of this research project, (later known as the Correlates of War Project or simply the COW Project), was a large computer data base containing information on past international conflicts as well as on certain economic and political variables which might explain the fluctuating nature of warfare. Over the years, J. David Singer authored a number of major studies (many using data produced by the COW Project) including: <title render="italic">Deterrence, Arms Control and Disarmament: Toward a Synthesis in National Security Policy</title> (1962, with Melvin Small); <title render="italic">The Wages of War, 1816-1965: A Statistical Handbook</title> (1972, with Susan Jones); <title render="italic">Beyond Conjecture in International Politics: Abstracts of Data Based Research</title> (1972, with Dorothy L. Barr); and <title render="italic">Resort to Arms: International and Civil War, 1816-1980</title> (1982). In 1971, the Center for Research on Conflict Resolution was closed. However, the COW Project continued into the 21st Century with funding from various outside sources.</p>
      <p>As professor of political science, J. David Singer has been a consistent advocate of rigorous training in scientific research methods. While acknowledging the value of some types of "pre-scientific" political science, he has urged that graduate courses and faculty recruitment reflect the new needs for statistical analysis, computer literacy, and reproducible research in political science. As coordinator of the World Politics field within the department (1969-1975), he pressed for such scientific rigor especially in the field of international relations. During the 1980s, Singer criticized the general decline in funding for higher education and what he felt to be the dilution of the political science program at the University of Michigan. In addition to his teaching duties in Ann Arbor, Singer has frequently been a visiting professor in Europe. He also participated in many conferences at various international peace institutes in Europe and Asia.</p>
      <p>As a peace activist, Singer has been a prominent speaker at a wide range of public forums and rallies. A critic of narrow nationalist interests in international politics, he has advocated arms reduction as a necessary first step toward world peace. As a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, SANE, and the World Federalist Association he has urged restraint in international conflict through petitions and political endorsements. He also publicly criticized United States government policy on such issues as the bombing of Cambodia in the 1960s and that of Libya in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Besides his role as researcher, teacher, and peace activist, Singer has maintained an interest in certain features of campus life at the University of Michigan. As a bike and motorcycle commuter he sought to improve motorcycle parking at the university as his many letters to the parking operations office will testify. He also took a special interest in the recreational sports program (especially tennis). Other concerns ranging from the quality of programming on the university radio station (WUOM) to the level of noise on the "diag" produced a number of lively letters in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
      <p>J. David Singer died in Ann Arbor in December 2009.</p>

          <p>The Topical File series, approximately 4.5 linear feet, is arranged alphabetically by topic and evidences all facets of Singer's work from the 1940s through the present. Researchers interested in Singer's early association with the <title render="italic">Journal of Conflict Resolution</title> and the Center for Conflict Resolution should consult files under those folder headings as well as "Correspondence, general" for the relevant years. Those interested in more general trends in political science research and Singer's appraisals of those trends should consult "Evaluations of Proposals/Manuscripts, 1966-1999", "Research Proposals, 1961-1983", and of "Editorial Board Assignments, 1985-1993."</p>
          <p>J. David Singer has spent over thirty years as a political science teacher at the University of Michigan and many portions of the collection pertain to that role. Singer took a keen interest in graduate education in political science generally and the world politics field specifically and folders under "Political Science Department" evidence the evolution of political science education from 1960. For those interested in Singer's views on the impact of budget cuts at the University of Michigan in the early 1980s and on the new priorities in political science research during the Reagan administration, the researcher would do well to consult the general correspondence files for those years.</p>
          <p>The folders "Political endorsements and petitions signed" relate most directly to Singer's role as a peace activist. These folders contain letters written on behalf of anti-war causes from the 1960s to the present. Singer's early involvement in the peace movement can be gleaned from the folders "United World Federalists, 1947-1950." It should be noted that Singer was a popular speaker at many academic and non-academic gatherings both in the United States and abroad. Topics ranged broadly from theoretical problems in peace research to contemporary foreign policy issues. Also of particular note are those file folders containing material on international peace associations and Singer's participation in these professional organizations. Hence, researchers interested in peace activism as well as those interested in peace research may want to consult the folders "Conferences and lectures, 1960-1989."</p>
          <p>Finally, those interested in campus life in Ann Arbor (especially during the 1960s and 1970s) should consult "University of Michigan Administration." These folders contain correspondence between Singer and various university administrators regarding topics of special interest to Singer on the University of Michigan campus.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence Series (1978-2000), approximately 6.75 linear feet, is arranged chronologically and topically into two subseries. It consists of incoming and outgoing letters written primarily between Singer and his professional colleagues. Also included are letters to friends, the media, prominent political figures, and various presidents of the University of Michigan. In addition, there is one separate file folder of correspondence between Singer and the economist Kenneth Boulding and his wife Elise.</p>
          <p>Materials in this series provide information on Singer's job search as a young Ph.D. graduate, and a wealth of information on his thoughts on political science, war research, and other societal concerns (found in the "Letters to the Editor" and "Policy Makers" folders). Other items, such as the MacArthur Foundation file and the "Dis-satisfaction" folder, shed light on some of the professional controversies that occurred during Singer's career.</p>

          <p>The Lectures and Conferences series (1960-1996), approximately .75 linear feet, contains information regarding lectures given by Singer and conferences in which he participated. There are a few speech transcripts included, but much of the materials provide only background information. Also included in this series is background information on his lecture tours of the Western United States, Europe and Asia from 1977 to 1978.</p>

          <p>The Programs series (1972-1989), approximately 3 linear feet, contains information on the Law and World Politics and Peace research programs, and include proposals for research.</p>
          <p>There is extensive information regarding the Correlates of War Project, also known as COW. Extant are correspondence which provides an excellent snapshot of the daily operation of the project and discussions regarding the selection and presentation of data. Although the COW, Staff Meeting Notes (1971-1975) are somewhat cryptic, those already familiar with the project will find these notes helpful in understanding the resolution of various methodological problems in the research. There are also hard-copy printouts of data sets.</p>
