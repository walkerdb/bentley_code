      <p>The McDonald / McLellan / Jewell family collection relates primarily to the activities of James Henry McDonald, his second wife Martha Wells McLellan and her family, and his third wife Christine Jewell and her family.</p>
      <p>James Henry McDonald (1853-1934) was a Detroit lawyer. He was educated at the University of Michigan, receiving his B.A. from the Department of Literature, Science &amp; the Arts in 1876 and his LL.B. from the Law Department in 1878. Throughout his life, he remained involved with University events and helping to coordinate his class reunions.</p>
      <p>James McDonald was married three times. His first wife, Martha Ireton, died suddenly in 1889. They had one daughter together, Martha Ireton McDonald. James later married Martha Wells McLellan. Together they had three daughters, Mary McLellan McDonald (Harris), Elizabeth Ann McDonald (Smith), and Margaret McDonald (Parr). Martha McLellan passed away in 1900 leaving extensive land holdings in Detroit, particularly along Cass Avenue and Woodward Avenue. The distribution of these lands among the children became a long-standing debate in the family.</p>
      <p>Christine Jewell became James's third wife. Christine was an active Democrat and increasingly became involved with politics. She worked her way through the party to the position of vice chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee in 1937. She spent a large portion of time in Washington, D.C. and became well known among political figures. She was also heavily involved in the Daughters of the American Revolution and held various positions within the organization. She was also an avid genealogist, compiling histories and collecting materials about the Jewell family, the McDonalds, and the families of McDonald's other wives.</p>
      <p>Christine's father was William Franklin Jewell, a successful Detroit businessman. After working in other faculty positions around the city, he founded the Detroit Business University in 1864. As president, he became a highly esteemed professional. He was involved with many Detroit activities including the Banker's Club, the Municipal League of Detroit, and was a member of the Church of Our Father, Universalist.</p>
      <p>James McDonald retired in 1928. He and Christine moved to their country estate, Glencoe Hills, in Ypsilanti. He passed away in 1934.</p>

            <p>The second subseries within the McDonald Family is the papers of James McDonald. This subseries documents McDonald's personal and professional life. McDonald's career in law is not documented in his papers aside from a few files regarding the founding and development of the St. John's Episcopal Church in Detroit and in Royal Oak. However, traces of his professional life are revealed in his personal correspondence with his children. He handled the business affairs of his children, often fueling stormy relations within the family. These letters detail the widening of Woodward Avenue in Detroit, and land holdings along Cass Avenue in Detroit and Geddes Road in Ann Arbor. McDonald's correspondence reveals his financial decline during the Depression. McDonald's daughters also attended the University of Michigan and describe life from the Sorosis House and the Newberry Residence. A small folder of material regarding McDonald's first wife, Martha Ireton McDonald, is also included.</p>

          <p>Miscellaneous Files are ones that could not be associated with any particular family. One folder details the service and death of Lieutenant Edward B. Gibson in World War I. Another contains old recipes, mainly for wine. There is also a treaty for the Village of Pleasant Ridge in this series. The last folder contains papers of a German immigrant and resident of Royal Oak, John Henry Weber. He was a landscaper and also sold nursery items. His papers were found in a separate shoebox.</p>
