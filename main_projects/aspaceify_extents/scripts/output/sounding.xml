    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Soundings was founded in 1977 by Glenora "Gerry" Brown in order to help women in their middle years regain their footing after widowhood or divorce. This social problem was just beginning to be recognized with the term "displaced homemaker," and there were few if any social programs in place to address the issue. Formerly a librarian at the Kelsey Library of the University of Michigan, Brown returned to school and received her Masters degree in social work. She chose to name her organization "Soundings" as a way to express the double meaning of taking a sounding on a river channel in order to navigate, and for the "sounds" all around, which a person in trouble may need help hearing through support and guidance from others. Since its beginning, Soundings' guiding mission has been to "promote both the economic and emotional well being of women." ("A Brief History of Soundings," History ("Herstory"), Printed Materials, Background, Box 1, Soundings.)</p>
      <p>Brown first ran Soundings from her home and financed the organization with a small personal bequest. She was soon introduced to Esther Donahue, an intern at the Center for the Education of Women (CEW). Esther became the agency's assistant director from 1978 through 1987 and later, comptroller. The first big program the two partners staged was "Anchors and Options" in September of 1978 at Bach Elementary School. This session covered the topics of physical and mental well-being, assertiveness training, financial planning, and strategies for reentering the work force. Over one hundred women showed up, far exceeding their expectations for attendance.</p>
      <p>After the Anchors and Options program, Soundings began to grow. Two local counselors volunteered their services. With startup grants received from the Ann Arbor Area Foundation and the Power Foundation, Soundings was able to pay the counselors and hire a part-time administrative assistant. A grant from the Michigan Department of Labor enabled Soundings to start its cornerstone program, "Target: Jobs for Women." Other grants came from the City of Ann Arbor and the Washtenaw County Department of Social Services. Another major Soundings program has been "Divorce and Beyond," a series of workshops and small group counseling sessions. In addition to grants and donations, Soundings is funded by program fees, which are charged on a sliding scale based on participants' income levels.</p>
      <p>Gerry Brown retired as director of Soundings in 1986. She was succeeded as executive director by Lynne Carbeck, with Lin Orrin and others following.</p>
      <p>As society changed over the intervening years and funding priorities shifted, Soundings faced increasing difficulty in securing sufficient operating funds for all of its programs. In addition, other existing agencies offered similar services, and women were as a whole becoming better equipped to deal with the problems accompanying divorce and widowhood. In the early 1980s, Soundings broadened its focus to include all women, not just those in their middle years.</p>
      <p>Over the next decade, more changes to the organization took place. Soundings' initial focus was on job readiness because this had been the only area for which funding was then available. In the mid to late 1990s, Soundings endeavored to add other programs to meet the needs of changing times. Soundings also made efforts to forge alliances with national and local agencies. These attempts met with varying degrees of success. In order to increase the scope of its mission and to widen its funding base, Soundings sought acceptance as a United Way member agency, explored alignment with Washtenaw Community College, and participated in a pilot project with Michigan Rehabilitation Services and the Department of Social Services. Soundings continues to provide support and services to women in the Washtenaw County area.</p>

          <p>The Administrative series (1.3 linear feet) is comprised of five subseries: Program Materials, Miscellaneous Administrative, Cooperating Organizations, Program Evaluations, and Personnel. The Program Materials subseries consists of workbooks, announcements, and some correspondence from Soundings' various job readiness and counseling programs. It is arranged alphabetically by program name. Also included in this subseries are the Participants files, with poems, letters, and quotes by participants, apparently used for promotional purposes. "Miscellaneous Administrative" contains topical files arranged alphabetically. These files relate more to Soundings' day-to-day administration than to its outreach programs. The "Cooperating Organizations" subseries is arranged alphabetically. The subseries consists of correspondence and other materials from organizations with which Soundings worked. Soundings was either a part of these organizations or received recognition or assistance from them. The Program Evaluations subseries contains evaluations of Soundings' many programs. These evaluations were filled out anonymously by the program participants. Evaluations are arranged chronologically, with an alphabetical arrangement within each year. The Personnel subseries contains contracts, evaluations, and correspondence related to the staff of Soundings.</p>

          <p>The Domestic Violence Project series (0.5 linear feet) consists of minutes, reports, and correspondence from the board meetings and the annual membership meetings of the organization called the Domestic Violence Project (also known as the Domestic Violence Project, Inc.). The Domestic Violence Project records were accessioned along with those of Soundings. The Domestic Violence Project is a Washtenaw County agency dedicated to providing temporary shelter, counseling, and legal assistance to victims of domestic abuse. It also works to change cultural attitudes toward abuse through education and public awareness campaigns. The Domestic Violence Project once shared office space with Soundings and worked closely with Soundings within the Ann Arbor community. For example, Soundings and the Domestic Violence Project were part of a community effort to receive funding for a substance abuse program, "Primary Prevention Services for Women," and the two agencies proposed jointly to form the Women's Resource Consortium, as detailed in the Michigan Office of Substance Abuse Services file (Grants, Box 5, Soundings).</p>

          <p>The Board of Directors series (1.3 linear feet) is comprised mainly of board meeting minutes and other documents (agendas, memoranda, reports, correspondence) that made up the board member "packet" for each meeting. The series also contains early materials such as Soundings' articles of incorporation, bylaws, and Gerry Brown's notes from the first year of meetings. Other material includes budget and correspondence files, as well as files for various committees and a separate file of reports from the executive director (which duplicates reports in the annual minutes files). These files are arranged in the order in which they were accessioned.</p>

          <p>The Grants and Fundraising series (1.2 linear feet) consists of grant applications, correspondence, announcements, and other materials pertaining to Soundings' fundraising activities. There are two types of files in this series: first, files on organizations (both government and private sector) from which Soundings sought financial assistance and second, those files having to do with various events which Soundings staged in order to raise money or increase its public profile. Some of the grant applications, such as the one submitted to the Michigan Office of Substance Abuse Services, were presented as a joint effort with other Washtenaw County social services agencies. The files are arranged in the order in which they were accessioned.</p>

            <p>The Sound Recordings subseries consists of audio cassettes. Most of these tapes are recordings of interviews with Soundings staff members, volunteers, and clients, which aired on local radio programs. In addition, there are promotional radio spots (both initial takes and the final cuts) created by Soundings, also for local broadcast. Musical audio recordings consist of a recording of a former client of Soundings, Bessie Leggett Phelan, singing the Soundings theme song, "Soundings," which she also composed, as well as the "Ode to Gerry," sung by some of the staff on the occasion of Soundings' tenth anniversary. There is also an audio 'letter' to Gerry Brown from the rest of the Soundings staff.</p>
