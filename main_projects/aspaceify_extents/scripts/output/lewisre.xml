      <p>Robert E. Lewis received his B.A. degree from Princeton University in 1959 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from The University of Pennsylvania in 1962 and 1964, respectively. He was appointed to the faculty of Indiana University in 1963 and rose to the rank of professor in 1975. Lewis joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1982 as professor and co-editor of the <title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary</title> (<title render="italic">MED</title>) and research scientist and was promoted to editor in 1983. He was named executive director of the <title render="italic">MED</title> in 1990. Begun in 1930, the <title render="italic">MED</title> survived the Depression and World War II and is the most important research project in the humanities to date at the University of Michigan. In 2001, the printed dictionary arrived at the end of the alphabet, and almost simultaneously the electronic version came on line completely searchable and available for supplementation and correction. With nearly 15,000 printed pages, the <title render="italic">MED</title> is a centerpiece for research in medieval English culture. Lewis also contributed to medieval studies, particularly in his essays on Chaucer and the <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title>. A skilled bibliographer, Lewis was co-editor of the <title render="italic">Index of Printed Middle English Prose</title> (1985). Upon his retirement in 2003, Lewis was named professor emeritus of English language and literature, executive director emeritus of the Middle English Dictionary, and research scientist emeritus.</p>

        <emph render="bold">History of <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title> Studies</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title>, to judge from the number of known manuscripts (120), was the most popular English poem of the Middle Ages, surpassing such popular poems as Geoffrey Chaucer's <title render="italic">Canterbury Tales</title> (its nearest competitor with 64 manuscripts), <title render="italic">Piers Plowman</title> (with 54), and John Gower's <title render="italic">Confessio Amantis</title> (with 51), and was itself surpassed in English only by the two versions of the Wycliffite prose translation of the <title render="italic">Bible</title> and the prose <title render="italic">Brut</title>. The poem exists in three versions: (1) an original or main version (in 99 manuscripts), which originated in the north of England, probably Yorkshire, with a preponderance of manuscripts from that area and the north midlands, but also extending into the west midlands and East Anglia and even into the southeast and the southwest; (2) a shorter, thoroughly revised recension (in nineteen manuscripts) originating somewhere in the south, with a more restricted distribution; and (3) a heavily revised and abbreviated version of the main version entitled <title render="italic">Speculum Huius Vite</title> (in two manuscripts).</p>
      <p>The popularity of the poem is supported by other signs: eighty per cent of the counties of England can claim at least one copy of the poem, some have two or more, and three of the copies are written in the Anglo-Irish dialect; extracts circulated separately (twelve in eight manuscripts); the poem was quoted in a number of other Middle English poems ("Stimulus Consciencie Minor," "Desert of Religion," "Of the Flood of the World," "Wheel of Fortune," for example) as well as in a stained glass window at All Saints Church in York); there was a translation into Latin prose made in the 14th century (six manuscripts exist); and the poem appears in wills and book lists.</p>
      <p>The <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title> is a long verse compilation (over 9,600 lines in rhyming couplets), divided into a prologue; seven books, which treat, in turn, the wretchedness of man's nature throughout his life, the world and the various conditions thereof, death and the fear of death, purgatory and its characteristics, the day of judgment, the pains of hell, and the joys of heaven; and a brief conclusion or epilogue. The poem has a great many sources: ultimately over twenty separate works, primarily Latin, including both well known ones like St. Augustine's <title render="italic">De Civitate Dei</title>, Honorius of Autun's <title render="italic">Elucidarium</title>, Pope Innocent III"s <title render="italic">De Miseria Humane Conditionis</title>, and Bartholomeus Anglicus's <title render="italic">De Proprietatibus Rerum</title> and not so well known ones like Robert Grosseteste's <title render="italic">De Penis Purgatorii</title> (in its French version) and Hugh Ripelin of Strasbourg's <title render="italic">Compendium Theologice Veritatis</title>.</p>
      <p>For a long time the poem was thought to have been written by the well known hermit and mystical writer Richard Rolle (died 1349), to whom it is attributed in five manuscripts, but his authorship is now considered extremely doubtful. Three manuscripts attribute the poem to Robert Grosseteste (circa 1170-1253), Bishop of Lincoln, but he lived too early to be the author. A more recent suggestion is William of Nassyngton (died 1359), chancellor of the Diocese of York and the author of the <title render="italic">Speculum Vite</title>, but there is as yet no proof for this. In genre the <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title> is unlike any other Middle English work in verse or prose, though it has some similarities and has been compared to the <title render="italic">Speculum Vite</title>. Its primary function was probably as a compendium of knowledge from which a parish priest could instruct his flock or draw material for his sermons, and its wide circulation in the 14th and 15th centuries indicates that it must have fulfilled its purpose.</p>
      <p>The poem is worth studying for a number of reasons and from a variety of points of view, and when Lewis came to Ann Arbor in 1982 he had just completed, with Angus McIntosh <title render="italic">A Guide to the Manuscripts of the Prick of Conscience</title> (Oxford: Society for the Study of Medieval Languages and Literature), which they hoped, as they said in their Preface, would "stimulate and facilitate research into some of the important . . . questions connected with [the poem], such as its genre, the reasons for its popularity, its audience, and its influence in Britain in the later Middle Ages"; and Lewis himself was planning to spend whatever free time he had on various aspects of the poem. He had made good progress on two projects: the sources (and the manuscript tradition of the sources) of Book I and an edition of one of the short poems indebted to the <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title>, the "Stimulus Consciencie Minor." But the work of the <title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary</title> took precedence during his official working years, and because of other commitments he was unable to complete these projects during retirement. He deposited his <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title> materials in the Bentley Library in the hope that other researchers would consult them as a starting point either to complete the two projects he began or to study other aspects of the poem.</p>

        <emph render="bold">Scope and Content Note</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The Robert E. Lewis papers relate primarily to research and study of the <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title> the most popular English poem of the Middle Ages. Prick of Conscience material includes reproductions (photocopies and microfilm) of medieval manuscripts and related Middle English texts as well as Lewis's correspondence, notes, and research files on the <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title>. Material relating to the Middle English Dictionary and his professional career is also present.</p>
      <p>The Lewis papers are arranged in five series. The first four series relate to the poem Prick of Conscience: <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title>, Related Materials, Notes on Cards and Slips, and Microfilms of Manuscripts. The content of the first two boxes are all in standard archival folders and are arranged by subject. In box three the materials represent a variety of formats (4" x 6" cards, 5" x 8" cards and slips, and a paperback book), also arranged by subject, with a few microfilms in various kinds of containers. The final box consists of microfilms only.</p>

          <p>The series <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title> contains correspondence 1972-1982, arranged from earliest to latest between Lewis and Angus McIntosh, of the University of Edinburgh, primarily about the preparation of their book, <title render="italic">A Descriptive Guide to the Manuscripts of the Prick of Conscience</title> (1982) as well as correspondence with Derek Britton (also of the University of Edinburgh), another researcher on various aspects of the <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title>, between 1974 and 1980, and occasional other scholars and librarians. Also included are reviews of Lewis and McIntosh's <title render="italic">Descriptive Guide</title>.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the series is devoted to various aspects of the poem: its manuscripts (both on groups of manuscripts and on individual manuscripts, chiefly of the main version); its other versions (the interpolated variants of the main version, the southern recension, and the revised and abbreviated <title render="italic">Speculum Huius Vite</title>); its sources (both in general and specifically for each of four books out of seven, with an emphasis on Book I, which Lewis had spent most of his time on); the authorship of the poem; its popularity and audience; and its influence (both in general and specifically in the short poem "Stimulus Consciencie Minor"), with an additional file on the manuscripts of the latter poem in preparation for an edition, on which Lewis was working.</p>
          <p>In all of the files on aspects of the poem, the organization adheres to the following pattern: general statement(s), if any, on the subject in question; specific correspondence, if any, about the subject, in chronological order; printed articles, if any, on the subject; and notes (chiefly handwritten) on the subject, in no particular order.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the series contains photocopies of manuscripts of the <title render="italic">Prick of Conscience</title>, in alphabetical order by the city and library in which they are housed, and they are followed by Lewis's collation sheets for selected lines of the main version, which he used to determine relationships among and between manuscripts.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The series Miscellaneous Professional Files contain Lewis's selection of such files from his personal archives organized by subject in nine subdivisions, divided into files stored in standard archival folders. The files are: Celebration of Completion of the <title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary</title>, <title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary</title> Miscellaneous, Publications (Articles, Notes, etc.), Books and Reviews, Unpublished Papers on Medieval Topics, Influential Scholars, Grants and Fellowships, Awards, and Appointment and Retirement.</p>
          <p>The Celebration of Completion of the <title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary</title> file chronicles the events, activities, and publications celebrating the completion of the <title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary</title> (<title render="italic">MED</title>) in the late spring of 2001, after 71 years in progress at the University of Michigan. The series contains five files. The first consists of materials leading to, from, or growing out of the biennial meeting of the Dictionary Society of North America (DSNA) held in Ann Arbor from May 6-9, 2001. In the left-hand pocket of the file are the official schedule and a poster for the DSNA meeting; the invitation to and the menu for the celebratory dinner on May 9th; and a copy of remarks by Jay Robinson introducing Lewis before his lecture during the afternoon of the 9th. In the right-hand pocket are announcements of the completion of the <title render="italic">MED</title>, of a celebratory lecture series at the University of Michigan in the spring of 2001, and of four celebratory sessions at the annual medieval conference at Western Michigan University just before the DSNA meeting; catalogues of two exhibits held during the dates of the DSNA meeting; and two printed summaries of the DSNA meeting.</p>
          <p>The second file contains articles about the completion of the <title render="italic">MED</title> written between April 2001 and April 2002 arranged in chronological order. The third file contains congratulatory letters and cards to Lewis (chiefly personal) from 2001 and 2002 arranged in nearly chronological order. The fourth file contains photographs taken during some official events of the celebrations: specifically, (1) the reception at Hatcher Library during the evening of May 7th; (2) the DSNA outing to Greenfield Village during the afternoon of the 8th; (3) Lewis's lecture during the afternoon of the 9th; and (4) the celebratory dinner during the evening of the 9th. The fifth file contains the special issue on the <title render="italic">MED</title> of the journal <title render="italic">Dictionaries</title> published in 2002, which contains some of the papers presented at the DSNA meeting (and others), along with tributes and congratulations from editors of historical dictionaries around the world collected by John Simpson.</p>
          <p><title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary</title> Miscellaneous contains four files. The first consists of articles on the <title render="italic">MED</title> written between 1982 and 1995 and from 2005 (for articles about the completion of the <title render="italic">MED</title> see the previous series). The second file contains three groups of <title render="italic">MED</title>"memory" items: (1) announcements and notes of congratulations on Lewis's appointment as editor of the <title render="italic">MED</title>, clipped together; (2) memorabilia from his time as editor and before (poems, announcements, cards, cartoons, etc.); and (3) "Excerpts from the Muddled English Dictionary," a humorous booklet produced for Alfred S. Sussman when he retired as Vice President for Research in 1985 (suggested by the <title render="italic">MED</title>, one of the units reporting to him). The third file contains three groups of photographs, each arranged chronologically: (1) staff and events at the <title render="italic">MED</title> offices, 555 South Forest, Ann Arbor (mid-1980's-2001); (2) <title render="italic">MED</title> staff and events off-site (1982-2001); (3) visiting Japanese scholars (1992-2002): Akio Oizumi, Hiroyuki Matsumoto, Tadao Kubouchi (not pictured), Matsuji Tajima (not pictured). The fourth file contains a compact disc of "Alphabet Odyssey," a program on the <title render="italic">MED</title> produced by Cindy Bisaillon on the Canadian Broadcasting Co.'s radio program "Ideas" on October 4, 2004; this disc was based in part on her interviews in Ann Arbor with <title render="italic">MED</title> editors and staff in 2001 and 2002.</p>
          <p>Publications contains two files of articles written by Lewis arranged in chronological order, 1961-1989 and 1990-2012.</p>
          <p>Books and Reviews contains files on three books written by Lewis himself or with others (for other books see list in first file). The first item, Lotario dei Segni (Pope Innocent III) <title render="italic">De Miseria Condicionis Humane</title> (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1978; London: Scolar Press, 1980), is an edition of the most popular and influential work (written in Latin in 1194-95) on the subject of <title render="italic">contemptus mundi</title> ("contempt of the world"), appearing in over 670 medieval manuscripts; the 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer was heavily indebted to the work and may even have made a prose translation of it (now lost). The file on the <title render="italic">De Miseria</title> contains: (1) a few miscellaneous items on the edition; (2) printed reviews; and (3) Lewis's correspondence with the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library in Collegeville, MN, about depositing his microfilms and photographic reproductions of nearly 450 manuscripts of the work and related texts there.</p>
          <p>The second file <title render="italic">Index of Printed Middle English Prose</title>, with N.F. Blake and A.S.G. Edwards (New York and London: Garland Publishing Inc., 1985), is divided into: (1) correspondence 1977-91, arranged from earliest to latest, between Lewis and the other editors primarily (Blake and Edwards), as well as other scholars, about the preparation and contents of the <title render="italic">Index</title>; (2) reviews of the <title render="italic">Index</title> between 1986 and 1989, clipped together; and (3) notes (followed by articles) for a possible revised edition or supplement.</p>
          <p>The third file contains the final installment of the printed <title render="italic">MED</title>, <title render="italic">Middle English Dictionary: Plan and Bibliography</title>, 2nd edition (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2007), which contains a thoroughly revised and expanded <title render="italic">Plan</title> (now called "History, Contents, and Guide to the Dictionary") written by Lewis; and a revised <title render="italic">Bibliography</title>, combining the original bibliography (1954), the supplement to it (1984), and the books and articles added made between 1984 and 2001, complied by Lewis and Mary Jane Williams, with assistance from Marilyn S. Miller. Three reviews have been added at the end of the file.</p>
          <p>Unpublished Papers on Medieval Topics contains, first, a list of papers presented by Lewis on various public occasions and, second, a selection of six of these and others. The first two papers are on the list and are checked. (The papers on the <title render="italic">Prick(e) of Conscience</title> (1974-76) are either in Boxes 1 and 2 and/or were incorporated into publications in Box 3 or in the subseries Publications above; the papers on "Word/Linguistic Geography" from 1992-93 are in Box 2; the papers on the <title render="italic">MED</title> were incorporated into publications on that subject either in the subseries Publications or in the subseries Books and Reviews above.) The next three papers, unlisted ("Old and Middle English Language and Literature," "Some Brief Remarks on the Fourteenth Century in England," and "Textual Criticism: M[iddle] E[nglish] Texts"), were presented as guest lectures in graduate courses at Indiana University. The final paper, also unlisted, is a brief appreciation of a former editor at the <title render="italic">MED</title>, Lister Matheson, presented at his memorial service at Michigan State University in 2012.</p>
          <p>Correspondence with Influential Scholars contains files on four scholars who were influential in Lewis's professional career. The influential scholars include: Howard C. Rice, Jr , Robert A. Pratt, Neil R. Ker, and Angus McIntosh. Each of the folders contains a statement written by Lewis on the importance of each scholar to his work. The files typically include correspondence with the scholars, cards, miscellany, obituaries, and correspondence with other colleagues and in some cases the surviving spouses.</p>
          <p>Fellowships and Research Grants contains, first, a list of the fellowships and grants received by Lewis during his career and, second, details of a selection of these awards (as Lewis's remaining records warrant), in chronological order.</p>
          <p>Awards consists of three files. These contain details of awards received by Lewis in the year and a half following the completion of the <title render="italic">MED</title>: (1) a Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, on 2 October 2002 (award letter first, with the other items following, chronologically arranged within the award folder); (2) election as a Fellow of the Dictionary Society of North America at its biennial meeting in Durham, NC, in May of 2003 (the <title render="italic">DSNA Newsletter</title> account of the meeting first, with the other two items following, chronologically arranged within the <title render="italic">Newsletter</title>); and (3) the Sir Israel Gollancz Memorial Prize for English Studies from the British Academy in London, on 13 October 2003 (award letter first, with the other items following, chronologically arranged).</p>
          <p>Appointment and Retirement, contains two files. The first is divided into: (1) letters and memos regarding Lewis's appointment at the University of Michigan in the fall of 1981; (2) his annual reports to the Department of English from his first full year, 1982-83, through his last, 2002-2003; and (3) an up-to-date (2012) copy of his Curriculum Vitae. The second file is about Lewis's retirement on 31 December 2003 (retirement memoir first, with the other two items following, chronologically arranged within the retirement-memoir folder).</p>
