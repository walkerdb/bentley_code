        <p>This collection was originally processed in the 1930s. In that processing, the volumes that make up the bulk of the collection were arranged more by size than by content, obscuring Winchell's organization of his papers. Each volume and folder was numbered. In the 1992 reprocessing, the collection was returned as much as possible to Winchell's original plan. The imposed volume and folder numbers were ignored, as they conflicted with Winchell's original volume numbering. To aid researchers working with references to this collection made between 1931 and 1991, a concordance of the imposed volume and folder numbers and their current locations has been attached as Appendix II.</p>

      <p>Alexander Winchell was professor of geology and paleontology at the University of Michigan, director of the Michigan Geological Survey, and chancellor of Syracuse University, but he was most noted as a popular lecturer and writer on scientific topics and as a Methodist layman who worked to reconcile traditional religious beliefs to nineteenth-century developments in the fields of evolutionary biology, cosmology, geology, and paleontology.</p>
      <p>Winchell was born December 31, 1824, in the town of North East, Dutchess County, New York. After studying medicine and teaching school as a teenager, he entered Amenia Seminary, also in Dutchess County, in the fall of 1842. In 1844 he enrolled at Wesleyan University, from which he graduated in 1847. Over the following years Winchell held a succession of teaching positions at <corpname>Pennington Male Seminary</corpname> in New Jersey, <corpname>Amenia Seminary</corpname>, <corpname>Newbern Academy</corpname> in Alabama, <corpname>Mesopotamia Female Seminary</corpname> in Eutaw, Alabama, and <corpname>Masonic University</corpname> in Selma, Alabama.</p>
      <p><corpname>Masonic University</corpname> opened its doors in the fall of 1853, with Winchell as president. Unfortunately a yellow fever epidemic forced the school to close shortly thereafter, and Winchell accepted an offer of the chair in physics and civil engineering at the University of Michigan. Two years later his appointment was changed to the chair in geology, zoology, and botany.</p>
      <p>By the time Winchell arrived at the University of Michigan, he had already begun his output of scientific publications, beginning with "Solar Spots," published in the New York Tribune, November 5, 1849. Winchell was a prolific writer: his bibliography contains 565 works.</p>
      <p>While teaching at the University of Michigan, Winchell lobbied for the revival of the <corpname>Michigan Geological Survey</corpname>, which had expired after the death of Douglass Houghton, the first state geologist, in 1845. In 1859 the legislature reestablished the survey. Winchell was appointed state geologist, while keeping his position at the University of Michigan. Winchell's survey concentrated on the geology of the Lower Peninsula, which coincided with his interest in the fossils found in the sedimentary rocks underlying that part of the state. A progress report was published in 1861 (<bibref><title render="italic">First Biennial Report of the Progress of the Geological Survey of Michigan</title>, MHC call number EA/153/MG345/F527</bibref>). With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, the legislature discontinued funding for the survey, and officially disbanded it in 1863.</p>
      <p>The <subject>Civil War</subject> brought Winchell an opportunity to return to the South for a time. In 1863 he took up a lease on a cotton plantation near <geogname>Vicksburg, Mississippi</geogname>, that had been seized from rebels. The venture brought him nothing but problems, however, and after Winchell returned to Michigan in 1864, his brother Martin, who was managing the plantation, was killed by guerrillas.</p>
      <p>It was during the 1860s that Winchell seems to have developed his most original <subject>geological theory</subject>. Private surveys of a number of oil-producing areas resulted in Winchell's exposition of the anticlinal reservoir theory of petroleum storage, which was proven and developed further by others in later years.</p>
      <p>Also in the 1860s Winchell first described the lake effect which moderates the climate of western Michigan, making the region suitable for orchard development. This discovery came as a result of a private survey of the Grand Traverse Bay region of Michigan.</p>
      <p>By 1869, the Michigan legislature was once again prepared to fund the Geological Survey, and Winchell was appointed director of the survey. Winchell's plan for a comprehensive survey of the resources of the state was described in <bibref><title render="italic">Report on the Progress of the State Geological Survey of Michigan</title>, published in 1871 (MHC call number DB/2/W759/M678/Set B/v. 1),</bibref> but he never completed the task. After disputes with the Geological Survey board and with the legislature, Winchell resigned his position with the survey in 1871.</p>
      <p>Winchell kept his teaching position at the University of Michigan until 1873, when he was named the first chancellor of Syracuse University. Disappointed with the position, Winchell resigned the following year, but remained at Syracuse as professor of geology.</p>
      <p>In 1876, Winchell accepted a position as professor of geology and zoology at <corpname>Vanderbilt University</corpname>, but was fired in 1878 in a dispute over the teaching of evolution. Shortly thereafter Winchell returned to the University of Michigan, where he remained, as professor of geology and paleontology, until his death in 1891.</p>
      <p>The relationship between science and religion was an interest of Winchell's beginning at least in the late 1850s, when he published <title render="italic">Theologico-Geology, or, The Teachings of Scripture Illustrated by the Conformation of the Earth's Crust</title>, and <title render="italic">Voices from Nature: Creation the work of One Intelligence and not the Product of Physical Forces</title> (both in MHC call number DB/2/W759/M678/Set B/v. 4). His work in this area expanded in the late 1860s, when Winchell began to tour, giving popular lectures on scientific topics. In 1869, while Winchell was directing the Geological Survey and teaching at the university, he also gave 48 public lectures in 5 states.</p>
      <p>Winchell's thinking on the relationship between science and religion was affected by the debate over <subject>Darwinism</subject> that raged in American scientific circles after the publication of <title render="italic">On the Origin of Species</title> in 1859. Winchell was never a Darwinist, but by the 1870s he seems to have accepted evolution without accepting the theory of natural selection.</p>
      <p>Two topics seem to have given Winchell much trouble in his attempts to reconcile his scientific knowledge with his religious faith: the age of the earth and the origin of the human race. Winchell's geological and paleontological research convinced him of the great age of the earth, which he tried to reconcile to the seven days of the Genesis creation story by making each day of creation represent an epoch of great length. In describing the history of the human race, also, Winchell could not reconcile the age of humanity, as revealed by archeological discoveries and explained by evolutionary theory, with biblical chronology and genealogy. Winchell solved this problem by suggesting the Adam was not the first human, but that Africans and other non-whites had evolved separately and were living before Adam was created. This solution caused various difficulties, and was the immediate cause of Winchell's firing from Vanderbilt University.</p>
      <p>Among other organizations in which Winchell was active, he was president of the <corpname>Michigan State Teachers Association</corpname> in 1858 and editor of the Michigan Journal of Education in 1859; an organizer of the University Musical Society of the University of Michigan and the Choral Union in 1879 and 1880; an organizer of the Geological Society of America in 1888 and its president in 1890.</p>
      <p>Winchell married Julia F. Lines of Utica, New York, December 5, 1849. They had six children, only two of whom survived Winchell. Alexander Winchell died February 19, 1891, in Ann Arbor.</p>

      <p>The collection is divided into six major and three minor series:
        <list type="simple"><item>Biographical</item><item>Correspondence</item><item>Diaries and journals</item><item>Writings and lectures</item><item>Reference and research files</item><item>Scrapbooks</item></list>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The papers of Alexander Winchell are those of an orderly man who carefully documented his own life through well-organized correspondence, diaries, notebooks, and scrapbooks. Winchell kept thorough evidence of his activities, writings, lectures, and thoughts, for most of his life. The only area that seems poorly documented is his university teaching. The collection does not appear to include significant material relating to relationships with students in the classroom.</p>
      <p><bibref>"Alexander Winchell, an editorial tribute," published in <title render="italic">The American Geologist</title> (Feb. 1892, MHC call number DB/2/W759/A512)</bibref>, includes a year-by-year account of Winchell's life, based on the papers, and probably written by his brother N. H. Winchell. Although there are no footnotes in this work, it provides a useful summary of Winchell's activities and clues to the existence of documentation in the collection.</p>
      <p>The collection is divided into six major series: Biographical, Correspondence, Diaries and journals, Writings and lectures, Reference and research files, and Scrapbooks; and three smaller series: Visual materials, Processing notes, and Card files.</p>
      <p>Winchell's bibliography is located in Box 1 (the most complete copy is in the "Permanent memoranda" volume), and drafts of many of his writings are found in Boxes 8-14. Copies of many, but not all, of Winchell's publications are found in the MHC printed collection. The card catalog includes details for all separately cataloged items. There are also three collections of pamphlets that are not inventoried: two slightly different bound sets prepared by N. H. Winchell after Alexander Winchell's death (MHC call numbers DA/2/W759/M678/Set A and DA/2/W759/M678/Set B) and a two-box collection of pamphlets collected by the University Library (MHC call number Univ. of Mich. Coll./J/17/W759).</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series (Boxes 1-5 and 25) includes a mixture of personal and business correspondence. The loose correspondence (Boxes 1-3) is chiefly incoming, with a few drafts of outgoing letters. Box 3 contains some incoming correspondence that has been separated from the general chronological series, most of it concerning the <corpname>Michigan Geological Survey</corpname>. Outgoing correspondence is located in the letterpress books in Boxes 3-5. A register of correspondence is found in Box 8. A card file of selected correspondents is found in the MHC reading room. (Ask the reference archivist for details.) In the Processing notes series (Box 23) are found biographical notes about many of Winchell's correspondents, made by Historical Records Survey processors.</p>
          <p>Note that Winchell sometimes cut autographs off of incoming letters. If text is missing it may be possible to reconstruct some of these letters from the autograph file in Box 14.</p>

            <p>The "field books" (Box 7) for 1852-1891 (not all years represented) include notes of geological and other scientific observations made both during Winchell's expeditions and in his daily life. This group also includes journals of his journey to Mississippi in 1863-1864 to manage his plantation. For the period 1859-1860 Winchell transcribed his field books relating to the Michigan Geological Survey into a large volume, which also is located in Box 7. (Field notes of Winchell's associates in the Michigan Geological Survey are located in Box 16.)</p>

          <p>The Writings and lectures series (Boxes 8-14) includes drafts of articles, book chapters, and lectures, and outlines for books and lectures. (Drafts that were identical to published works located in the MHC printed collection were not retained in this series.) The writings are arranged chronologically. The series also contains a group of volumes entitled "Notebooks," in which Winchell copied the text of many of his publications. The notebooks are grouped under three topics: "General" or "General geology," "Michigan" and "Popular." The series ends with two volumes and one folder of Winchell's poetry (Box 14). The writings are arranged chronologically.</p>

          <p>The Scrapbooks series (Boxes 19-22) is divided into seven sections: "General" (1855-1890), "Personal" (1847-1890), "Souvenirs of European travels" (1873-1874), "State" (1857-1890), " <corpname>Syracuse University</corpname>" (1872-1876), " <corpname>University of Michigan</corpname>" (1855-1890), and " <corpname>Vanderbilt University</corpname>" (1878-1880). Except for the "Souvenirs of European travels" these scrapbooks are chronological, indexed, collections of clippings prepared to document Winchell's activities and interests. Winchell read, and clipped, widely. The "University of Michigan" scrapbooks, especially, can be a valuable source for the history of the University in that time period. The "Vanderbilt University" scrapbook covers the controversy over Winchell's firing and his views on the origin of humanity. The "Souvenirs of European travels" contains only tickets, receipts, and other memorabilia of his European tour, with little research value.</p>
