      <p>The Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) is the legally certified collective bargaining agent for the graduate student teaching and staff assistants (GSAs) at the University of Michigan. These GSAs concurrently pursue graduate degrees and teach undergraduates at the University of Michigan. As GEO tee-shirts note, they are "Workers, Teachers, Students." As the bargaining agent for GSAs, GEO has negotiated and sustained a series of contracts improving the conditions of employment since 1975. From the vantage point of GEO, this task was made considerably more difficult by an intransigent university administration, adverse Michigan Employment Relations Council (MERC) decisions, the 30% annual turnover of membership within GEO, and the burnout of unpaid officers. But GEO has endured and at present is the oldest, continually-functioning union of graduate student employees in the country. This longevity is owed to the periodic infusion of new blood, leaders newly committed to "carry it on" in the GEO tradition, and to the continued guidance and support of GEO's affiliates, the Michigan Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of Teachers.</p>
      <p>After an unsuccessful attempt in 1971, GSAs were able to organize a union over the course of the 1973-74 academic year. This union, GEO, was sanctioned by a MERC certification election in April 1974. GEO then began the arduous process of reaching a contract settlement with the university. The first contract was ratified in March 1975 after a five week-strike by GEO. The second contract was tentatively agreed to in November 1976, but the university refused to sign it until GEO dropped pending grievances. GEO filed an unfair labor practice (ULP) suit against the university; the university countered that the ULP did not apply since GSAs were students, not teachers. This began a series of suits and appeals which ended with a 1981 MERC decision that teaching and staff assistants were employees, but research assistants (who had been part of GEO) were students. In November 1981, the 1976 contract was finally signed by both parties and ratified by the members.</p>
      <p>The MERC decision of 1981 marked a watershed for GEO. No longer could the university profitably argue that GEO had no legal right to exist. The university changed the tenor of its bargaining, turning to maximizing productivity in relation to GSA costs. GEO continued to bargain for a fair wage, elimination of tuition for GSAs, control of class size, paid training for teaching assistants, and stronger language on affirmative action. These issues determined the nature of the negotiations and contracts of 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1987. While the bargaining was tense, the confrontations which marked the process in the 1970s were largely absent; only in 1987 did a strike seem possible.</p>
      <p>Over the course of its history, GEO has prided itself on being a truly democratic union. Its constitution provides that any substantive decision has to be approved by a vote of the members. At times this has made for delay and difficulty in transacting union business, but the leaders regard this as a fair trade off. Originally the day-to-day business of GEO was carried out by the executive committee while the stewards council saw to the organizing and outreach functions of the union. In the early 1980s, the administration of GEO was reorganized to include more voices in guiding the union. At this time, a ten-member steering committee was formed to supplant the executive committee. The day-to-day running of the union has fallen to paid office staffers, drawn from the ranks of GSAs. Although not officially disbanded, the stewards council was dissolved, and met only at times of crisis. The council was reinstated in October of 1991 and continues to operate in much the same way as before the disbanding.</p>
      <p>The GEO has continued to fight for the rights of graduate employees delving into issues of race discrimination, sexual harassment, and discrimination based on international student status. The group has also continued to be actively involved in the Ann Arbor community with activities such as Adopt-a-Store and the National Day of Action. Bargaining and negotiations continue to be important functions of the GEO, and issues such as childcare for GSIs and appropriate healthcare benefits have been topics of negotiation. The 2005 negotiations created a particularly broad set of documents, including ballots for a proposed strike.</p>

      <p>The records of the Graduate Employees Organization consist of agendas and minutes of meetings, correspondence, newspaper clippings, newsletters, contract negotiating proposals and notes, and membership lists. These materials document the struggle of GSAs for recognition, fair wages, and good working conditions at the University of Michigan since 1974. The records of GEO came to the library in a series of accessions beginning in 1985. These accessions were arranged into five series: Administration, Bargaining, Office Files, Original Artwork, and Archived Website, reflecting the core structures and functions of the union. Some of the materials in different accessions overlap in dates and information with the prior accessions to this collection.</p>

          <p>The Administration series was created in the course of processing and consists of materials related to the structural organization of the union, its affiliation with MFT/AFT, and its efforts to keep members informed. This series is comprised subseries reflecting different accession of GEO records. Records within each subseries are alphabetically by type of material. The series as a whole reflects GEO's pragmatism and commitment to fairly representing the interests of its members. The researcher should note that decision-making within the GEO hierarchy was mutable with the executive committee, stewards council, and steering committee having final say at different times. The 1975 strike tactics and strategy are well covered in the minutes of the executive committee and stewards council and in The Picket Line, the GEO daily newsletter of spring 1975.</p>

          <p>The bulk of the collection is devoted to the Bargaining series. This is natural given that the primary function of any union is the securing and maintenance of a fair contract. This series runs six linear feet and is arranged chronologically according to the years of negotiations or preparation. Within each bargaining year the contract proposals and counterproposals are assigned primacy so that anyone interested in a particular issue or article can readily find it. Ancillary bargaining material is arranged according to GEO's scheme of background, research, and survey materials. These are quite illuminating in revealing which issues were seen as crucial by the membership and leaders of GEO. Researchers should note that the 1974-1975 Negotiations file contains a wealth of material related to the 1975 strike.</p>

            <p>The Bargaining and Negotiation Files (1971-1979, 1984-86) series is comprised mainly of materials relating to the Unfair Labor Practice suit that GEO brought against the University of Michigan in 1976. Materials include the court reporter's transcripts of the proceedings and testimony of the hearing (boxes 11 &amp; 12), surveys of Graduate Student Assistants and results (box 11), and materials relating to other GEO legal actions taken against the university. This series provides good information on the duties and responsibilities of Graduate Teaching Assistants and their battle to be recognized as university employees instead of compensated students.</p>

          <p>The Office Files series consists of those records necessary for the day-to-day functioning of GEO or those materials generated by the office staff in the course of performing its jobs. These Office files were received in two accessions and are organized into two subseries relating the separate accessions. Within each subseries materials are generally arranged alphabetically by type and comprise nearly 4.5 linear feet of materials. The bulk of the materials in this series consists of the University of Michigan's lists of GSTA appointments. These lists are used by GEO to check membership status and dues payment. The handbooks in box 5 provide excellent insight into GEO's goals and its own sense of accomplishment over the course of time</p>

            <p>The Office Files, 1973-1985 subseries contains documentation on the operations of the GEO office. Included is information on the budget, departments in the university, and other topical information. The complete set of office log books from May 1977 to January 1983 (Box 10 &amp; 11) will give the researcher an insight into the daily workings of the office and to some extent, how GEO functioned as an organization.</p>

          <p>The Original Artwork, 1995-2000 series contains a collection of strike posters, signs and advertisements enlisting the help and interest of graduate employees in the GEO. The variety of artwork is very interesting as the methodology of conveying the cause through mathematical graphs, foreign languages, and scientific formulas is very creative and complex.</p>
