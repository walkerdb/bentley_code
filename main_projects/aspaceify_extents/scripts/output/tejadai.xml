    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Irene Tejada was best known for her love of art and her friendly personality. In her many years of teaching, beginning in 1942, she shared her passion for art with hundreds of students in Michigan schools and abroad.</p>
      <p>Her love of learning equaled her love for teaching as she not only earned a master's degree in design but also took numerous courses beyond her graduate work. Tejada became known as an expert on the use of indigenous materials for the production of arts and crafts, and had a particular interest in multicultural art. Her master's thesis was entitled "Persian Turquoise Glazes."</p>
      <p>Tejada's early teaching career led her to schools in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Detroit, and she also taught at West Virginia State College before coming to the University of Michigan in 1950. During the years 1950 to 1955 she completed her master's degree and served as Staff Artist for the UM Audio-Visual Education Center, working as an illustrator of various materials and designer of educational exhibitions. In 1955 she joined the staff at the UM laboratory school, known as University School, as an art teacher where she taught K-12 students until 1970, when the school closed. In her later career she became an assistant professor in both the School of Education and the School of Art at the University of Michigan and was granted emeritus status in 1989.</p>
      <p>Many students came back to visit Tejada over the years and acknowledged her teaching as the origin for their later involvement in the arts. She believed that children's art education should aim for the same quality as advanced art courses and enthusiastically exhibited student artwork in the schools and in the community. She was awarded Teacher of the Year at University School in 1968, and in 1991, received recognition for her lifelong dedication to art education from the Michigan Art Education Association.</p>
      <p>Tejada's professional work included publication in the <title render="italic">School Arts</title> magazine and <title render="italic">Brown Bag Ideas from Many Cultures</title>, a resource she created for use in multicultural arts units. She was also a member of various organizations and committees including the National and Michigan Art Education Associations, the School Arts Coordinating Committee, Delta Kappa Gamma (a teachers' sorority supporting women in education), the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), and a committee, founded by Tejada in 1972, for incorporation of a multicultural curriculum in Ann Arbor Public Schools. The committee's multicultural courses were in place at the University of Michigan by 1973 and the inclusion of such programs was mandated in the State Legislature in 1974.</p>
      <p>As an artist, teacher, friend, and innovator Irene Tejada was respected by her colleagues and students alike. She died on October 25, 1999, and her obituary can be found in the University of Michigan Publication <title render="italic">The University Record</title> from December 13, 1999.</p>

      <p>The Irene Tejada Papers include materials from the professional career of Irene Tejada, as well as materials documenting the history of University School. Organized into three series, Teaching/Professional Materials, Visual Materials, and University School Related Materials, the papers span the years 1928-1998 with the bulk of the materials from 1950 to 1970. The strength of the collection lies in the many depictions of life and activities at the University School through both visual and non-visual materials.</p>

          <p>The Teaching/Professional Materials series includes two subseries. The first, General Materials, contains a variety of materials from Tejada's career including published artwork, class and teaching materials, correspondence, etc. The second subseries, Exhibits and Displays, focuses on displays which Tejada designed, but also includes non-visual display materials such as exhibit announcements and programs. The largest group of materials comes from Tejada's work on "UM Presidents and the School of Education 1817-1980" which was a display in University School as well as a separate book. Researchers should also consult the "Slides" and "Photographs" areas within the Visual Materials series to see displays by University School art students.</p>

          <p>The last series, University School Related Materials, includes materials which focus on University School as a whole rather than on Tejada's personal work. Examples include school publications, directories, alumni activities, and documents regarding the closing of University School. Some materials in the Publications and the Historical and General Materials folders originate from before Tejada joined the University School staff in 1955. Researchers should observe that notes in this series indicate a few instances where Tejada is specifically mentioned or involved.</p>
