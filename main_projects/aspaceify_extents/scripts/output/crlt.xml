      <p>One of the first of its kind in the country, the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) at the University of Michigan was established in 1962 by the Board of Regents after a faculty committee recommended:</p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1) That the University of Michigan create a Center on University Teaching with the broad aim of providing maximum assistance to the faculty of the University in the task of providing effective instruction of the highest quality; and</p>
          <p>2) That it be of prime importance that the Center be created at the outset as an institution devoted to the encouragement of educational excellence. (Box 3, Folder: History #2, "Regents Proceedings")</p>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>CRLT staff members spend much of their time providing services to the university community. Among the most important programs and services of the Center are Instructor Designed Questionnaires (IDQ), which facilitate student ratings of courses; Evaluations and Examinations, a scoring service for both the IDQs and objective examinations such as foreign language tests, entrance examinations, and machine-gradable examinations from various university courses; instructional workshops and colloquia on matters of interest to teachers; teaching assistant training workshops; the Faculty Development Fund (FDF), a supplement to the base budget of the Center which awards grants to selected faculty in order to encourage new directions in teaching; computer consulting, particularly with regard to the use of computers in the classroom; and program evaluation and consulting. As of 1997, the Center had developed the leading program in the country for training foreign teaching assistants.</p>
      <p>Although primarily concerned with service, the Center's staff have undertaken many research projects. Among the more important have been student development studies of the Inteflex, Pilot, and Residential College programs; studies of computer usage in the Chemistry and English departments; meta-analyses of the effectiveness of computers in teaching, of the factors affecting student evaluations of faculty, and of the use of personalized system instruction; and research on strategies and motivational factors which affect teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>Administratively, the Center has always reported to the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Its staff members are primarily comprised of professors from units within the university with joint appointments in the Center and their home unit, and research scientists hired to oversee research projects and various services provided by the Center. Initially the Center was advised by the University of Michigan Faculty Senate Subcommittee on the Improvement of Instruction. Later, an advisory committee was established of faculty interested in the work of CRLT. One of the tasks to which the Advisory Committee devotes a good deal of time is approving requests from the FDF. Policy matters are primarily decided by the Center director and an elected executive committee of CRLT staff members.</p>
      <p>Due to worsening economic conditions and as part of the move to a "smaller but better" university in the early 1980s, CRLT was one of several units subject to review and budget reduction. Its budget was reduced by 30% in 1981 and a year later the Center participated in a university-wide budget cut of 5%. The Evaluations and Examinations office was closed and its director released, although CRLT continues to provide scoring services. Yearly Provost Office budget allocations are supplemented by various grants, requests and donations.</p>
      <p>CRLT is a central administrative unit reporting to the provost and serving all 19 schools and colleges of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor Campus. It is also available to service the Dearborn and Flint Campuses.</p>
      <p>As a department CRLT recognizes that undergraduates, graduates, instructors, faculty, administration and professional staff represent differing interests, interests which coexist to define the culture of the University of Michigan. The stated goal is to foster an environment of cooperation between these various subcultures and between the various disciplines to contribute to the excellence of the university.</p>
      <p>The Center's URL is http://www.umich.edu/~crltmich/.</p>

          <p>The Budgets series (2 linear foot) is arranged chronologically (1962-1993) and is comprised mostly of budget sheets and correspondence. The materials can be used to study projects undertaken, staffing changes, and how CRLT reacted to the budget cuts of the early 1980s. In addition, the files are one of the few sources of information on the first ten years of the center's existence. [Box 1, 15]</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series (3 linear feet) consists of volumes of outgoing correspondence (1964; 1972-1984; "early 1980s" and 1994) arranged chronologically. Early letters are written by Stan Ericksen in his capacities as director and later, as senior research scientist. There are also letters from other CRLT staff and directors, including Drs. Kulik and McKeachie. The correspondence sheds light on major activities of the center, and the role it played in assisting other universities to set up similar centers. The researcher should note that, on occasion, copies of minutes of staff and executive committee meetings are included in the volumes of correspondence. [Box 1-2, 13]</p>

          <p>The Topical series (4 linear feet) is divided into three overlapping time spans (reflecting separate accessions) and thereunder is arranged alphabetically. CRLT did not produce an annual report until 1975; for information on the its various projects and activities prior to that time, the researcher should consult the Activities Inventories file. The administrative life of the center is well documented in the minutes found in the files of the Advisory and Executive Committees and in the Staff Meetings folder. Use of computers in classrooms around the university can be studied from materials in the Computer file, and the Wolverine Fund folders. The fund supplied grants to assist with computer-aided instruction. The folders include interesting correspondence and grant proposals. The Reviews files contain insightful documents on the reviews conducted to determine whether the CRLT budget was to be cut. The report of the 1983 committee includes a helpful history. Other materials related to the history of CRLT, especially the early years, are found in the History folders. The Vice President for Academic Affairs files are comprised mostly of correspondence on a variety of topics, including the budget, computers, and teaching assistant training. Also of interest are materials related to the orientation of new faculty and graduate student instructors, and papers written by the CRLT staff about a variety of education and teaching issues.

          <p>The Grants series (13 linear feet) consists of correspondence, applications, evaluations and reports relating to grants awarded by CRLT. The series contains three subseries: Faculty Development Fund, Instructional Development Fund, and Miscellaneous Grants. The Faculty Development Fund (FDF) subseries concerns grants awarded through that fund from 1977 to 1999. Through FDF the Center awards up to $6,000 to individual faculty members for smaller projects and up to $10,000 to departments, programs, and groups of faculty. These grants generally support ambitious, relatively large faculty projects. The subseries is arranged chronologically, by the year the grant was awarded and then alphabetically by the name of the professor receiving the grant. [Box 4-6, 9-12, 16-17, 19-22]</p>
          <p>The Instructional Development Fund (IDF) concerns grants awarded by that fund between 1973 and 2000. These projects tended to be more modest than those funded by the FDF. The Instructional Development subseries is organized by year, then alphabetically within each year by the name of the professor receiving the grant.</p>
          <p>The Miscellaneous Grants subseries covers grants awarded from 1965 to 2000. These grants were funded through the Instructional Development Fund , the Wolverine Fund, or the Special Projects Fund. The Miscellaneous Grants subseries is arranged alphabetically by the name of the department receiving the award for the years 1965-1973. After 1973, the Miscellaneous Grants are arranged first by grant, then chronologically by the year the grant was awarded, and then alphabetically by the name of the professor receiving the grant.</p>
          <p>The Grants series includes materials only for projects that received grants, not for applications that were denied grants, before 1998. Some of the unfunded grant applications were included for materials after 1998.</p>
