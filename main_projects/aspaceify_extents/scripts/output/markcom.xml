    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Marketing Communications originated through a subtle shifting of university ownership for its publicity role. A predecessor to the current unit was the Publications Office, once in charge of designing and publishing university-related publications. They originally created and disseminated University Relations publications, including the Proceedings of the Board of Regents, the University of Michigan Bulletin series, commencement programs, and university-wide recruiting materials. They also produced publications for individual university units for special events or serial production. The goal of the Office of University Publications was "effective communication in print." (Administrative Records, 1968 Policies and Procedures, Box 1)</p>
      <p>As the university grew, boundaries adjusted to accommodate additional needs and responsibilities of the university's units and administration. The Publications Office underwent several leadership alterations throughout their history. Their original administrative body, the Director of University Relations, became the Vice President for University Relations in 1964. This title was adjusted to reflect its responsibility for monetary support to become the Vice President for University Relations and Development in 1969. The office redefined itself once again when the university's financial difficulties forced a greater emphasis on fundraising and development during the 1980s. It became the Vice President for Development and Communications in 1985. In 1988, the office was further broken down into Vice President for Development and Vice President for University Relations. The current Marketing Communications office reports to the Vice President for Communications, one of the three units created out of the previous University Relations vice presidency in 2001.</p>
      <p>While still active with commencement and recruitment materials, Marketing Communications has otherwise diversified and expanded their operations from their preceding incarnation, focusing on additional services and multimedia presentation. Marketing Communications currently provides the University of Michigan community with custom products and services to advertise and promote campus programs and events. The office offers consultations, project planning assistance, graphic and website design, and editorial services. Print and digital products include brochures for departments and special events, announcements, posters, invitations, stationary and cards, class bulletins, campus maps, periodicals, event programs, logos, banners, conference brochures, recruiting mailers, annual reports, videos, and websites. A small sample of their creations include the Faculty and Staff Directory, University Profile, LSA Magazine, Business School's Alumni Relations Website (http://www.bus.umich.edu/alumni), and the M Card logo.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Marketing Communications record group is divided into three series including Administrative Records, Products, and Visual Materials. Materials within the Products series were sampled to produce a representative body of the office's work. Some items were removed to existing publication record groups. Many photographs within the Visual Materials series originated from University of Michigan News and Information Services. These items were removed from the Marketing Communications records because they can be found within the News and Information Services record group at the Bentley Historical Library.</p>

          <p>Administrative Records (1968-1987) consisting of three folders. The series sheds light on the origins of the Marketing Communications office. The policies and procedures are the record group's link to past incarnations of the unit. It includes organizational charts, job descriptions, office roles, and procedures for standard activities within the Office of University Publications. These records reveal not only procedural and focus changes between the offices but also the dramatic differences in the use of technology and today's focus on multimedia communications. The Undergraduate Recruitment Literature Committee minutes and correspondence reveals a time when admissions advertisement played a larger role within the office's mission.</p>

            <p>The Photographs subseries contains two folders of images of Ann Arbor (ca. 19 80-1988) and Detroit (1969-1994) and 3.5 linear feet of University of Michigan images, mainly faculty and staff portraits. There are two groupings within the Faculty and Staff heading. Folders listed under A Legacy of Commitment to Scholarship: Named Faculty Positions at the University of Michigan contain the photographs used in the creation of the publication. They are arranged by department. The remainder of the faculty and staff photographs are general portrait files arranged alphabetically. Most of these images are from the 1980s although there are few exact dates on the photographs. General subject files comprise the rest of the photographic images. They are listed alphabetically by topic. Dates were listed when identified on the images.</p>

            <p>The final visual material format is videotapes. It includes a group Business School interviews filmed in 1999. This raw footage, apparently intended for an unidentified promotional video, documents key Business School professors' opinions about the program, identifies their current and past studies, and has him or her describe the school's doctoral programs. The two other videotapes within the record group are finished products from Marketing Communications. The Center for the Education of Women promotional video, filmed in the late 1980s or early 1990s, describes the services and achievements of the program. The Michigan Engineer, a 1983 promotional recruiting video for the College of Engineering, includes commencement footage, student commentary, and an interview with James Duderstadt.</p>
