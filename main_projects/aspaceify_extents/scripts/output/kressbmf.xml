      <p>Sebastian S. Kresge, founder of the S.S. Kresge Company with more than 850 retail outlets in North America by the end of his life, was born in 1867 at Bald Mount, Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>The son of Pennsylvania Dutch farmers, he attended rural schools and later - by teaching school, working for a grocer, and working on his father's farm - the Fairview Academy and Polytechnic Institute. With earnings from his bee-keeping enterprise, he later attended and graduated from Eastman's Business College at Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1889.</p>
      <p>After graduation, Kresge worked as a bookkeeper for three years and a traveling salesman for five years. Not only was he successful in his travels selling hardware and tinware (he saved more than $8000 during those years), but he also became well acquainted with the leading entrepreneurs in the field of five and ten cent retail stores, including Frank W. Woolworth, S.H. Kress, J.J. Newberry and W.T. Grant. He was impressed with the industry, and in 1897 approached one of his customers about forming a partnership. John G. McCrory, who owned several five and ten cent stores, agreed to the deal, and Kresge spent several months learning the business first-hand from the manager of McCrory's Jamestown, New York, store, G.C. Murphy. Shortly thereafter, McCrory and Kresge opened two additional stores, one in Memphis, Tennessee, which was managed by Kresge, and the other in Detroit, Michigan, managed by Murphy for McCrory. When Murphy decided to branch off on his own in 1899, Kresge assumed control of the Detroit store and later that year traded his half interest in the Memphis store to McCrory for complete ownership of the Detroit outlet. A year later, Kresge and his brother-in-law, Charles J. Wilson, formed the firm of Kresge and Wilson and opened a second store in Port Huron, Michigan. By 1907, when Kresge bought out his partner and changed the name of the firm to S.S. Kresge, there was a total of eight stores located in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Over the next five years, Kresge expanded his chain to 85 stores by buying out smaller chains or opening new outlets, and in 1912 incorporated the business in Delaware as the S.S. Kresge Company. Four years later, with 150 stores, the company was reincorporated in Michigan. Kresge remained president of the firm until 1925, and thereafter served as Chairman of the Board until his death. The company continued its phenomenal growth and expanded into Canada (the S.S. Kresge Company, Ltd., in 1929) and Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>In addition to his business involvement with S.S. Kresge Company, Kresge was the sole owner of Kresge Department Store in Newark, New Jersey, which he established in 1923. He became involved in the field of the full-range department stores when he served as president of Kresge Department Stores, Inc., which owned the Palais Royal department store in Washington, D.C., and controlling interest in The Fair from 1925-1957. In 1920, Mount Clemens (Michigan) Pottery Company was acquired and, as a subsidiary of S.S. Kresge Company, made the dinnerware that was sold in Kresge stores.</p>
      <p>Throughout his life, Kresge was concerned with improving the lot of his fellow man and in 1924 established the Kresge Foundation with an endowment of $2 million. Over the next thirty-five years he gave an additional $60 million to the Foundation, which provided assistance to religious, medical, educational, and youth organizations and institutions. As trustee and treasurer, Kresge devoted a good deal of his time to Foundation work.</p>
      <p>In addition to his Foundation work, Kresge was a supporter of the prohibition movement. He donated many funds to church organizations (he was a Methodist). Furthermore, he was a member of the Republican party.</p>
      <p>Sebastian Kresge was thrice married: in 1897 to Anna E. Harvey, by whom he had five children: Stanley Sebastian, Ruth Harvey, Howard Carrington, Catherine Harriet, and Ann Elizabeth; in 1924 to Doris (Mercer) Harden, and in 1928 to Clara Katherine (Zitz) Swaine. He died at the age of 99 in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania, in 1966. Clara survived him.</p>

      <p>The Sebastian S. Kresge Papers are divided into two series: Business Records, and Personal Records. The papers were microfilmed in 1994 and are available for inter-library loan.

          <p>The Business Records (1937-1966) series is comprised of two subseries, the Chronological Files and the Topical Files, and pertains to Mr. Kresge's tenure as chairman of the board of S.S. Kresge Company, and his involvement with Kresge Department Store, Newark, New Jersey, and Kresge Department Stores Incorporated. The series consists almost entirely of the records of Kresge's nephew and personal secretary, Amos F. Gregory. When Gregory wrote to Kresge, he sent along a carbon copy of each letter so that Kresge could make notes on the copy and return it to him. Incoming correspondence to Gregory includes letters from Kresge and his wife Clara.</p>

            <p>The Chronological Files subseries (5.5 linear feet) is arranged by year, and within each year by topic. Financial records and correspondence, the majority of which concern loans and securities transactions, predominate in these files. Matters pertaining to real estate, investments, incorporations, and capitalizations are also documented, and there are scattered materials related to the Kresge Foundation. (For specific locations of these types of materials, see the line entries in the contents list.) Of particular interest are the 1937 S.S. Kresge Company, C.B. Tuttle files which contain enlightening materials on the attempts by Kresge to keep the price of the company's stock at $26 during the early years of the depression. In addition, the Howard Baldwin files from the 1950s contain correspondence from Baldwin to Kresge regarding a wide variety of important business concerns of The Fair, Kresge-Newark, and the Kresge Foundation. The researcher should also note the Kresge Correspondence files which contain letters to and from Kresge and Gregory. Much of their content concerns financial matters, and on occasion the researcher will find Kresge reflecting on other topics, including politics, causes in which he was interested, and his home life.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files subseries (one-half linear foot) is also primarily concerned with financial matters. In the Biographical folders, the researcher will find a number of interesting biographical sketches of Kresge which focus on his business career. There are fairly extensive records documenting his stock (Kresge and non-Kresge companies) and bond holdings during given periods of his life.</p>
