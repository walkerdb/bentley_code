      <head>Narrative History</head>
      <p>The Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) is a division of student affairs that administers the Code of Student Conduct (Code). The OSCR investigates and adjudicates violations of the Code, training students, faculty and staff as members of the arbitration panel.</p>
      <p>The Code of Student Conduct is the University of Michigan policy detailing the non-academic rights and responsibilities of its students, the most recent in a succession of attempts to establish a policy for student behavior.</p>
      <p>In 1970 the Board of Regents approved Bylaw 7.02, delegating to the University Council the responsibility for formulating and proposing regulations for student conduct. Any code created by the University Council was subject to approval by the Regents, the Michigan Student Assembly, and the Senate Assembly.</p>
      <p>In March 1973, the Board of Regents adopted the Rules of the University Community, which were to be enforced by a pre-established university judicial system. This judicial system was revised at the October 1979 Regents meeting; however, the rules and judicial system were never employed due to inadequate procedures and a cumbersome amendment process.</p>
      <p>By June 1982, the university executive officers charged the University Council, under the authority of Bylaw 7.02, to develop a new set of rules and procedures. The Council over the next six years attempted to develop a new process, but was unsuccessful in adopting such a policy. In response, the Regents, at a 1988 meeting, passed a resolution by which Bylaw 7.02 would automatically expire at the end of May 1989, unless the University Council recommended and the Regents adopted amendments to Bylaw 7.02 that would allow it to function effectively in making recommendations to the Regents. In May 1989 the Regents extended the sunset on Bylaw 7.02 to December 31, 1989. As no amendments had been adopted by December 31, 1989, Bylaw 7.02 expired.</p>
      <p>While the University Council struggled to develop a university judicial system, the Regents adopted in April 1988 the Policy on Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment in the University Environment (the "Policy"). The Policy was intended to provide a mechanism for addressing incidents of sexual harassment, racial harassment and other types of discriminatory harassment by students that interfered with the university's educational mission. The Policy went into effect on May 1, 1988, implemented and administered by the Office of the Vice President for Student Services (later renamed Vice President for Student Affairs) with substantial assistance from the Affirmative Action Office and the Office of the General Counsel.</p>
      <p>On May 25, 1989, a lawsuit filed against the university in U.S. District Court sought to overturn the Policy on grounds that it violated the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. On August 25, 1989, the Court struck down portions of the Policy as unconstitutional, particular those portions related to verbal behavior and verbal conduct. As a result, President Duderstadt, with the assistance of the General Counsel developed and enacted an interim policy to address matters of discriminatory harassment, to remain in effect until a more comprehensive policy could be written in accordance with the court ruling.</p>
      <p>It was 1992 before the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs began working to draft a new policy establishing a set of rights and responsibilities for students, including procedures for hearing violations of the Policy. Two pieces of federal legislation helped precipitate the process - the Drug Free Schools and Colleges Act of 1990, and the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. These policies required an on-campus policy and hearing procedure for violations of alcohol and other drug laws and for sexual assault and rape, respectively. The end result, the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities (SSRR), was adopted on an interim basis, taking effect on January 1, 1993, and was administered by the Vice President for Student Affairs, Maureen Hartford.</p>
      <p>In April 1995, the Board of Regents mandated that the Vice President for Student Affairs, Maureen Hartford, write a new code that was to be a "statement of shared values" and a "process to facilitate the resolution of differences." The Code of Student Conduct, written during the summer and fall of 1995, with input from the campus community, was submitted to the Regents and approved in November 1995, taking effect on January 1, 1996, replacing the interim SSRR policy. Nomenclature is still unclear at times - some offices on campus presently refer to the Code of Student Conduct as the SSRR.</p>
      <p>During the summer and fall of 1998, a Code Implementation Review Committee conducted an internal assessment of the Code of Student Conduct and the Office of Student Conflict Resolution; an external review was also conducted at that time. Maureen Hartford officially presented the Code report to the Regents at their February 1999 meeting; at the same meeting, the Regents approved an amendment to the Code of Student Conduct, giving the university president the final say in code changes (the right had been previously held by the Board of Regents).</p>
      <p>Additional information about the development of standards for student behavior is available in the Vice President of Student Affairs record group; further information about the Office of Student Conflict Resolution is available as of 2008 at the following URL: http://www.oscr.umich.edu/</p>

      <p>The Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) records include materials related to the creation of standards for student behavior at the University of Michigan. These records include minutes from groups assigned to create standards of conduct; drafts and final policies implemented by the university; correspondence between campus administrators, legal counsel, and students and staff; formal evaluative reports on policies and their effectiveness; and original forms from students and staff telling administrators of their opinions on various issues related to standards of conduct.</p>
      <p>A second accession was received from the Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) in August of 2008 and added 5.0 linear feet to the record group. The scope of the new records consists mostly of printed and produced materials including guidelines, worksheets, newspaper clippings, training materials, and reviews. The material also touches on the Code of Student Conduct including reviews, completed student and faculty surveys, and newspaper clippings of articles about the Code.</p>
      <p>The OSCR records (7.0 linear feet) date from 1962 to 2006 and are organized into eleven series: Background Material; University Code for Non-Academic Conduct and University Judicial System; Policy on Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment; Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities (SSRR); Code of Student Conduct; Guidelines, Worksheets, and Forms; Training Manuals; Pubic Relations; Reviews and Reports; Surveys; and Publications.</p>

The files contain the text of the policy as it applied to students as well as faculty and staff, and outline procedures for its resolution, adjudication and implementation. While the record group does not document the legal case whereby the policy was found unconstitutional, the Interim Policy files summarily document the establishment of an interim policy. Typical policy infractions can be ascertained from the Harassment Report files, which were prepared on an annual basis.</p>

          <p>The Code of Student Conduct series, 1994-1998, (1.0 linear foot), is an alphabetically arranged series containing materials related to the development, review and implementation of the Code of Student Conduct. The process and work of the Code Workgroup is detailed by minutes and agenda. The development of the code is particularly well documented, and the series contains a good number of code drafts with comment by committee members, campus administrators, and outside consultants, reflecting the ongoing development of the code and the thought-process behind it. Faculty and student input into the code is also well represented in the record group; feedback and opinions are contained in the drop box response and focus group files. In 1998, the code was subject to both an internal and external review process; final reports in this series succinctly reflect their work and provide an evaluative tool for the effectiveness of the code after its implementation.</p>

          <p>The Surveys series, 1992, (2.0 linear feet) is arranged alphabetically and includes the completed surveys of 171 faculty and 3050 students. Issued in the summer of 1992, OSCR distributed the survey to ascertain faculty and student opinions on the proposed Code of Student Conduct. The student surveys are housed in their original three-ring binders. Some of the data mined from the surveys is present in Box 1 of the earlier accessioned record group. A few surveys were removed and arranged based on subject; they are present in a folder in this series.</p>
