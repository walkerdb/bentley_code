    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Edward Howard McNamara was born in Detroit, Michigan on September 21, 1926. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, from July 1944 to June 1946. Under the G.I. Bill, McNamara attended the University of Detroit, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and political science in 1959. He also completed one and a half years at the University of Detroit law school.</p>
      <p>From 1948 to 1970, he was employed at the Michigan Bell Telephone Company. While employed there, McNamara was elected to a two-year term as Livonia city councilman in 1962, and re-elected to four-year terms in 1964 and 1968. He became the council president in 1968, and was elected Mayor of Livonia in 1970. He served as mayor until 1986. He was then elected as Wayne County Executive, and served in that position from 1987 to 2002.</p>
      <p>As county executive, McNamara's lasting contribution was in improving the Detroit Metropolitan Airport. His efforts led to a $1.6 billion renovation of the airport, which included the addition of two runways, a new access road, an 11,000 car parking structure and a 97-gate terminal for Northwest Airlines. The terminal was dedicated to McNamara for his efforts, and was formally named the Edward H. McNamara Terminal.</p>
      <p>He was also known for eliminating Wayne county's significant debt, renewing social services to the elderly population in the county, and negotiating deals for new baseball and football stadiums in downtown Detroit.</p>
      <p>McNamara's political career was brought under suspicion in November of 2002, when Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and state police raided his office, seeking evidence for a federal grand jury investigation dealing with corruption in airport contracts and campaign fund-raising by his administration. No hearings were ever called, and all charges against McNamara and his staff were dropped in early 2007.</p>
      <p>In late 2002, shortly after leaving office, McNamara was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer of the lymphatic system. He died of heart failure on February 19, 2006.</p>

      <p>The Edward H. McNamara papers largely concern his public political career. These papers do not include the records of his various office and administrations. Instead, they largely present a favorable picture of the political life of McNamara, and highlight his achievements.</p>
