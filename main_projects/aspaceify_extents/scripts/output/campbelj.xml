      <p>While called the James V. Campbell papers, this collection is actually a collection of papers of Campbell's family, prominent in legal affairs in Detroit, Michigan, during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
      <p>Henry Munroe Campbell (1783-1842), and his wife Lois Bushnell Campbell (d. 1876), brought the family to Detroit in 1826. Henry M. Campbell was born in the upper Hudson River Valley of New York, moved to Buffalo and then in 1826 to Detroit. He worked as a merchant, banker, and judge. Henry and Lois had five children, Valeria (1815-1895), Henry Munroe (1821-1835), James Valentine (1823-1890), Lois, and Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>Children of Henry M. Campbell:</p>
      <p>Valeria Campbell (1815-1895) was a teacher in Detroit and during and after the Civil War served as secretary of the Soldiers' Aid Society of Detroit, later known as the Michigan Soldiers' Aid Society and the Michigan branch of the U.S. Sanitary Commission.</p>
      <p>James Valentine Campbell (1823-1890) was born in Buffalo, New York, and came to Detroit with his family in 1826. He was admitted to the bar in 1844 and entered partnership with Samuel T. Douglass. Campbell served as secretary of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan 1845-1846, justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan 1857-1890, and Marshall Professor of Law at the University of Michigan 1859-1890. In 1849 he married Cornelia Hotchkiss Campbell (1823-1888). Together they had six children, Henry Munroe (1854-1926), James Valentine (1856-1894), Charles Hotchkiss (1858-1927), Douglass Houghton (1859-1953), Edward DeMille (1863-1925), and Cornelia Lois (known as Nellie).</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Campbell Douglass in 1856 married Samuel Townsend Douglass (1814-1898), the law partner of James V. Campbell. Douglass moved from Fredonia N.Y. to Detroit in 1837, where his cousin Douglass Houghton was a leading physician and State Geologist, and entered the law office of Henry N. Walker and Asher B. Bates. In 1840 Bates retired and Douglass became Walker's partner. In 1844 James V. Campbell became a member of the firm now called Walker, Douglass and Campbell. Elizabeth (Campbell) Douglass and Samuel T. Douglass had three children: Mary Campbell Douglass, who attended the University of Michigan, 1874-1876, and married Frederic P. Anderson of Grosse Ile, Michigan; Benjamin Douglass (1859-1911), an 1882 engineering graduate of the University of Michigan and engineer for several Detroit companies; and Elizabeth C. (Lily) Douglass.</p>
      <p>Children of James V. Campbell:</p>
      <p>Henry Munroe Campbell (1854-1926) graduated from the University of Michigan in 1876 and University of Michigan Law School in 1878. He became the law partner of his brother Charles and of Henry Russel. He served as a delegate to Michigan's 1908 Constitutional Convention.</p>
      <p>James Valentine Campbell (1856-1894) was a broker in Detroit.</p>
      <p>Charles Hotchkiss Campbell(1858-1927) graduated from the University of Michigan in 1880, and became law partner of his brother Henry and of Henry Russel.</p>
      <p>Douglass Houghton Campbell (1859-1953) graduated from the University of Michigan in 1882, and received his Ph.D. there in 1886. He later studied in Germany and became professor of botany at Stanford University.</p>
      <p>Edward DeMille Campbell (1863-1925) graduated from the University of Michigan in 1886 and became professor of chemistry there. He was blinded in a laboratory accident in 1892.</p>

          <p>Family Materials is the largest series and consists of visual materials and a chronological sequence of family correspondence, 1834-1941. The photographs include portraits of James V. Campbell, and a lesser number of other family members. The earliest portion of the family correspondence includes letters of the first Henry M. Campbell and several of his children. During the 1850s and 1860s letters of James V. Campbell to his wife and children predominate. These letters concentrate on family matters but also explain to his family Campbell's reactions to his work on the Supreme Court. The bulk of the series consists of letters to Valeria Campbell and Nellie Campbell, most from family members. Many letters from Charles H., Douglass H., and Edward D. Campbell describing their student life at the University of Michigan are found in the 1870s and 1880s. Later letters describe Douglass's studies in Germany, Edward's blindness, and the later lives of all three brothers. Also in the 1870s are found letters to Mary Campbell Douglass while she attended the University of Michigan (no letters from her are included). In the period 1885-1887 a number of letters are found from women active in Soldiers' Aid Societies during the Civil War, collected by Valeria Campbell for a publication of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. This series also includes newspaper clippings and other materials not easily identified with a specific family member.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Valeria Campbell Materials series consists chiefly of correspondence, reports, and other papers created or collected by Campbell in her work as secretary of the Soldiers' Aid Society of Detroit (known after 1863 as the Michigan Soldiers' Aid Society), which served as the Michigan branch of the U.S. Sanitary Commission. (The history of these organizations is complex, and is explained in detail in "History of the Michigan Soldiers' Aid Society, 1861-1865," by Robert Spiro [MHC call number EA/69/S759/H673].) The papers document the societies' efforts to aid soldiers during the war as well as to care for the needs of returning veterans at the war's end. Also included are papers relating to the Detroit Soldiers' Home, Harper Hospital and Soldiers' Home, the Michigan Committee for the Relief of the South, and the Northwest Sanitary Fair. One item unrelated to soldiers' aid is Campbell's Sunday School record book from St. Paul's Church in Detroit.</p>
