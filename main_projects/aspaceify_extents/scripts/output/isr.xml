        <emph render="bold">Introduction</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The Survey Research Center, forerunner of the Institute for Social Research, was established at the University of Michigan in 1946, under the direction of Rensis Likert, as a center for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences. Fifty years after its founding, the Institute for Social Research (ISR), had become the nation's longest-standing laboratory for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences. ISR surveys are a national resource and have set the standard for research design across the country. Findings from ISR studies have contributed to policy and practice on issues ranging from racial prejudice and drug abuse to health, retirement and welfare. Largely self-supporting through grants and external contracts, ISR had a budget of approximately $33 million in 1997.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Survey Research Center and the Research Center for Group Dynamics</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Prior to coming to the University of Michigan, Likert worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture developing a survey facility to provide data on the problems of farmers and their reactions to federal farm policies. During World War II, Likert's survey work expanded to provide data for several federal agencies. The studies were on public finance, morale, and government policies, among other topics. After the war, Likert and others sought a university setting that would provide a facility for large-scale sample survey research and greater opportunities for teaching and research in the social sciences. The University of Michigan was selected and Likert was appointed as director. Likert brought with him Angus Campbell, George Katona, Charles Cannell and Leslie Kish. Initially skeptical of the establishment of a research institute not closely connected with a teaching department, the executive officers of the university stipulated that the Survey Research Center (SRC) was to operate through outside grants. The university would provide office space and general university services. Those working for the Center originally were not eligible for tenure. To promote its interdisciplinary nature, the Center was administratively separate from other schools and colleges and its executive committee was made up of members from a variety of relevant disciplines.</p>
      <p>From the outset, Likert and Campbell, working together, provided excellent leadership. Committed to delegation of authority and group involvement in major decisions, Likert promoted the Center's contributions to national life and Campbell provided superior administrative skills. The senior staff met weekly as a group to discuss and decide upon a wide range of issues.</p>
      <p>In 1948 the Research Center for Group Dynamics (RCGD) moved from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where it was founded in February 1945, after the death of its founder Kurt Lewin. Dorwin Cartwright continued as the director of RCGD in its new location. In 1948, an umbrella organization for SRC and RCGD was created and named the Institute of Social Research.</p>
      <p>Administratively, ISR is composed of several centers, each strongly autonomous in their research and administration. The development, design, administration and reports of research are center functions. The history of ISR is best understood through each of its research centers. Although the centers have undergone significant change, the core center remains the SRC.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Survey Research Center (SRC)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Structurally, the SRC consisted of several research programs as well as four technical sections which were involved in most research projects and conducted their own methodological investigations. The sections included: sampling, field office, coding and computer support group. Sampling selected national household samples and consulted on sample design and other statistical questions with research from ISR, the university and other places outside the university. The field office managed the data collection operations of SRC and provided technical assistance to the research staff in preparing data gathering instruments, developing study designs, and analyzing various modes of data collection. The coding section converted the survey data to numeric codes for use in data processing. The computer support group developed and maintained hardware and software for computerized data processing and analysis.</p>
      <p>One of the earliest integrated research programs of SRC was the Economic Behavior Program which was related to economic decisions made by consumers and businessmen. Initially under the direction of George Katona who was trained in economics and psychology, the program included annual national surveys undertaken for the Federal Reserve Board from 1946 to 1971 and the annual Survey of Consumer Attitudes which were conducted from the early 1950s several times a year until they became a monthly survey vehicle in 1978. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics was initiated in 1968. A panel study on consumer's debt behavior, it involved interviewing a national sample of 5,00 families to be followed annually over a five-year period. Continuing to the present day, the study has had significant implications for the study of poverty.</p>
      <p>A second major sphere of activity within SRC, initially known as the Human Relations Program, focused on leadership, motivation and organizational structure and effectiveness in formal organizations. Under the direction of Daniel Katz, the program was renamed the Organizational Behavior Program in the late 1950s. It continued through the 1980s and was a national resource for organizational research. New programs in SRC evolved over time. In the late 1950s and early 1960s members of SRC's Organizational Behavior Program and members of the Research Center for Group Dynamics established the Social Environment and Mental Health program. From 1960 to 1970, research in the program focused on the assessment of stress in work settings and the effects on health. By the 1970s, research in the Social Environment and Mental Health unit focused on job-related transitions, the study of social support as a buffer against the effects of stress, and off-the-job factors that enter into the management of stress. In the late 1980s and 1990s the program's focus had extended to assessing the development of intervention programs to alleviate stress and adverse mental health consequences, the role of psychosocial factors in the determination and maintenance of health in middle and older age populations, as well as the source of inequalities in health, especially by race and socioeconomic status. The staff included psychologists, sociologists and epidemiologists with joint appointments in their departments.</p>
      <p>A nationwide longitudinal study, "Youth in Transition," was launched in 1965 under the direction of Gerald Bachman to study young men as they entered tenth grade and following them until five years after most had graduated from high school. The study found that the socioeconomic level of a family had the most pervasive influence on a boy's development of any of the background characteristics measured.</p>
      <p>A new program within the Youth and Social Issues program, "Monitoring the Future," was launched in 1975 and would sustain funding through the 1990s. "Monitoring the Future" was originally a five-year series of national surveys to collect data on senior classes and the use of drugs. Eighth and tenth graders were added to the survey in 1991 and in 1992 the survey received an $18 million federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The survey has had a major impact on national policies on public health and education, especially regarding use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco and helps set the agenda for national drug control policies.</p>
      <p>SRC organized a summer session beginning in 1948 to offer courses in survey methods. A special program for training survey sampling statisticians was initiated under the direction of Leslie Kish in the 1960s in conjunction with the summer session.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Center for Political Studies (CPS)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Another early and continuing interest of SRC was the study of political attitudes and behavior. The first national election study was conducted after the 1948 election and the program expanded into other areas of political behavior. The program became the Center for Political Studies (CPS) in 1970 under the direction of Warren Miller. Research expanded to include political socialization of young adults in the mid-sixties, as well as studies of political structures and comparative politics. Between 1952 and 1976 national studies of the American electorate were conducted in 1948, 1952, 1956 and biennially thereafter. These studies were formalized in 1977 as the National Election Studies (NES) and funded by the National Science Foundation. Established in 1977 through the National Science Foundation, the National Election Study (NES) formally established a national resource to sustain and enhance the diversified data that support basic research on voting behavior and public opinion. By the mid-1980s, most of the senior staff had joint appointments in political science.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Research Center for Group Dynamics (RCGD)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The original goals of the RCGD were to conduct research on group behavior and on the relationship of the individual to the group, and to apply its research findings to the solution of social problems. Early projects of RCGD included research on fraternities, communities and schools, and research on group functioning. Research for the Office of Naval Research was conducted on various aspects of leadership and authority in the 1950s. Research on the formal structure of groups received attention in the 1960s. In subsequent decades research included group processes, interpersonal coping and control, and social cognition. By the mid-1980s, the major emphasis in RCGD was on the study of social cognition, the processes whereby individuals deal with information about themselves and others, and how that information enters into social behavior. By the 1980s almost the entire research staff had joint appointments in the social psychology area of the psychology department.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1962, in cooperation with twenty-one other universities, the Inter-university Consortium for Political Research (ICPR) was established at ISR. The Consortium's goal was to work toward external collaboration in the area of research on political behavior. The aims of the Consortium included joint planning of new surveys, data gathering and sharing of the common pool of data, as well as coordinating analysis plans to minimize duplication of effort and encourage exchange of current theory and results. After the establishment of CPS in 1970, ICPR was housed within CPS, although decisions about acquisitions are made by the ICPR board. In 1975 the name was changed to Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) reflecting its increasingly multidisciplinary nature. Since its inception ICPSR has maintained an annual summer training program in methods of quantitative political and social research. Courses carry university credit and attract hundreds of research scholars and students each year.</p>
      <p>
        <emph>The Center for Research on the Utilization of Scientific Knowledge (CRUSK)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1961, Ronald Lippitt and other ISR staff members began exploring the questions concerning knowledge utilization as a coherent and viable domain of inquiry. In the fall of 1962 with the aid of funds provided by the Ford Foundation, Vice President Roger Heyns appointed a university-wide committee to study the need for the development of a new university activity focused on the more effective, practical utilization of scientific knowledge. As a result of the committee's recommendations, the Center for Research on the Utilization of Scientific Knowledge (CRUSK) was established in 1964 as part of ISR. Its charge was to research the processes by which scientific knowledge is disseminated and utilized, bridging the gap between the creation of new knowledge and the use of knowledge. Floyd Mann was the first director of CRUSK. Early work at CRUSK focused on how scientific knowledge and innovations were used by different entities and how other programs generated social research designed to be of use to policy makers. In the first 15 years CRUSK also included action-oriented staff interested in changing organizations. In later years CRUSK research focused on health and education policy. By 1971 CRUSK was at its peak in terms of number of programs and size of staff with seven senior staff. By the mid-1970s much of the staff had left, including Mann and Lippitt. A large component of CRUSK, which had been concerned with making improvements in elementary and secondary education was dispersed. In 1986 with many vacant staff positions and a financial struggle, a decision was made to dissolve the center.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Institute for Social Research (ISR)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Throughout its history, funding sources and staff compensation have been important issues. In the mid-1960s, research expanded in many different directions and new research techniques were being explored. ISR staff expressed concern regarding the direction of research, fiscal constraints, and the ability to attract new senior staff members. The University of Michigan Board of Regents granted tenure privileges to senior members of the professional staff of ISR on November 15, 1968, although as early as 1952 a report to the president requested tenure be extended to Institute personnel.</p>
      <p>By the early 1950s, the staff of ISR had grown from a dozen to over 200. After a series of temporary locations which included the basement of the University Elementary School and space in Old University Hall, ISR moved into its own building on Thompson Street in 1965 with a second wing added in 1976. Construction on a third wing was begun in 1988 and was completed the following year.</p>
      <p>Early support from the psychology and sociology departments was important in the decision to establish ISR at the university and ties between those units were strengthened and enlarged over the years. ISR staff have taught in a variety of disciplines including economics, journalism, mathematics, political science, psychology, sociology, education, public health, law, social work, business administration, and engineering. Staff also collaborate with different schools, colleges and departments on various research projects or make available the sampling, coding interviewing and data processing staff. Over the years, ISR members have become increasingly involved in departmental activities.</p>
      <p>ISR was characterized in its early years by rapid growth; in the 1950s research volume increased from an annual rate of less than $1 million to about $2 million. Annual volume in the 1960s increased from about $2 million to $7 million, and in the 1970s from about $7 million to $14 million. In 1981, ISR confronted severe revenue losses due to decreased revenue support at the federal level, forcing ISR to look for support from local and state governments and private industry. In 1982/83 the Institute's Computer Service Facility was dismantled and its IBM 360/40 given to the Computing Center, in an effort to reduce administrative and support services. The development of a computer-assisted telephone interviewing and direct-data entry system was developed in the late-1970s at SRC and is still used.</p>
      <p>Rensis Likert retired as director of ISR in 1970 and was succeeded by Angus Campbell from 1970 to 1976. Thomas Juster became director in 1976 and completed his second five-year term as director in mid-1986. He returned to the Economic Behavior Program within SRC. Philip Converse assumed the ISR director role in 1986 and stepped down from that position in January 1989. Robert B. Zajonc was director from 1989 to 1994 when Harold K. Jacobson became acting director, in addition to his role as director of CPS. David Featherman assumed the role of director in 1995.</p>
      <p>In 1986, at the suggestion of President Shapiro and Vice President Frye, an outside committee was asked to review ISR. Chaired by Professor James Tobin of Yale University, its report made a number of recommendations regarding possible directions and developments, some of which were subsequently implemented. As of 1997, ISR is the nation's longest-standing laboratory for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences. Its professional and administrative staff number over 350 and the research staff represent the disciplines of psychology, political science, economics, and sociology, among others.</p>

      <p>The records of the Institute for Social Research are arranged in four subgroups reflecting the organizational of ISR and separate subgroup for photographs. The subgroups and principal series include:

      <p>Comprised of 52 linear feet of material spanning the years 1936 to 1992 these records document the founding and subsequent development of ISR and its related centers. The records provide an overview of the administration of ISR and the evolution of social science survey research methodology.</p>
      <p>The records are divided into five subgroups: ISR ADMINISTRATIVE FILES, CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON THE UTILIZATION OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE (CRUSK), RESEARCH CENTER FOR GROUP DYNAMICS (RCGD), SURVEY RESEARCH CENTER (SRC), and PHOTOGRAPHS. There are gaps in the records. No records exist within the ISR record group for the Center for Political Studies, and there is little documentation for the early years of ISR and SRC or the later years of RCGD. These gaps can be addressed in part through the papers of Rensis Likert, Angus Campbell, Dorwin P. Cartwright and Philip E. Converse, which are all held at the Bentley Historical Library. When viewed in conjunction with other ISR-related personal papers in the Bentley Historical Library, a rich and detailed picture of the growth of ISR as a center and a social science research discipline emerges.</p>

            <p>Governance Committees consists of nine feet of records documenting the decision making bodies of ISR including the Administrative, Executive and Policy Committees. Core documentation in these files provides an overview of broad issues of concern before ISR such as relations between ISR and university departments, methods of conveying the value of social science research, as well as other more focused subjects such as key personnel changes and promotion policies.</p>

              <p>The Administrative Committee records date from 1949 to 1992 and consist of agendas, minutes and proceedings, and notes and indexes for scattered years. The agendas and minutes are arranged in a separate chronological series. The agendas for the Administrative Committee meetings include attachments such as project proposals, promotion review material, and memos regarding topics to be discussed at meetings. Issues and actions taken by the Administrative Committee concern the administration of ISR, such as physical space, budget and overhead, project proposals, salaries and promotions, and security and safety. Some of the minutes for the years 1959 to 1968 include agendas for the next meetings. There are gaps in the minutes, especially for the years 1963 through 1966.</p>

              <p>The Executive Committee minutes and agendas, date from 1949 to 1990 and are arranged in one chronological series. Minutes for meetings prior to 1949 can be found within the records of the Survey Research Center. The minutes offer insight into key issues such as the creation of new centers, the types of researchers ISR sought to recruit and promote, research design and sources of funding, as well as the institute's relationships with the university. There are occasionally broad discussions of the social sciences; for example in 1990 the committee explored the idea of a Social Sciences Consortium.</p>

            <p>The Director's Files (10.2 linear feet) date from 1946 to 1986 and are primarily those of Thomas Juster and Angus Campbell but there is some material of Rensis Likert.

              <p>The largest portion of the correspondence files, which measure 1.5 feet, are arranged alphabetically and are primarily those of Angus Campbell, documenting communication with publishers, researchers, and former ISR employees, among others. The correspondence dates from 1952 to 1986 and there is some overlap between these correspondence files and the University of Michigan and Foundations segments of the Director's files. Of note is the folder of correspondence with Milton Moss who was funded by ISR from 1973 to 1975 to assist in communicating research findings to federal agencies which might find them relevant. There is also a folder relating to King Features, dating from 1972 to 1975, which documents an attempt to familiarize the public with the findings of social research through a syndicated column.</p>

              <p>Director's Advisory Committee (DAC) (1 linear foot) documents a committee formed in 1976 as a forum to advise the director on substantive long-range issues involving ISR. Initially five staff members representing the ISR program directors met twice a month in meetings open to any program director or senior study director. The function of the committee was to discuss and make recommendations about various subjects selected by the director. Topics discussed include programmatic review, promotion policies, and computing. DAC was discontinued during Juster's six-month leave in 1983 and upon his return he did not resume the committee but instead convened ad hoc groups of senior staff to discuss particular issues as they arose. These records are most useful for Juster's position papers on such issues as the functions and roles of the Centers and the Institute, Institute level reviews, and development activities.</p>

              <p>The Federal Budget and National Priorities segment (.5 feet) documents the impact of the Reagan budget cuts on ISR and the initiatives the director and staff took to minimize those cuts. Included are interviews conducted by Patricia Gurin with business executives and foundation officers in the private sector and congressional testimony by ISR staff, as well as correspondence with congressional representatives. These records make apparent the severity of the impact of federal government funding cuts to ISR.</p>

              <p>Foundations, Associations, and Other Groups (1.5 feet) documents efforts to secure funding sources as well as to develop ideas for research projects. The files are primarily those of Angus Campbell although there are some of Thomas Juster's. Worth noting are the files under National Science Foundation which include the successful proposal for a three-year-grant for $3.1 million. The grant was awarded to ISR in 1971 to provide the sustaining funds necessary to strengthen ISR as a national center for social science research, including expanding the national sampling operation, improving methods and technology, and providing better access to data.</p>

              <p>The Topical Files (4 linear feet) date from 1946 to 1986 and are primarily those of Juster. They do contain material from earlier directors, notably the General Funds files. Although these files cover a variety of subject areas, there are several files of note. The Teaching Titles files and the Promotion Policy files are important for discussion of the relationship of ISR staff to the university and include discussions of tenure and compensation issues as they relate to ISR staff. The folders under Computers and Computing provide documentation of the use of computers at ISR. The Development folders document an effort by ISR to establish funding sources other than government agencies. The folder on Organizational Structure contains correspondence between Provost Adams and Rensis Likert regarding the establishment of ISR at UM. The Executive Officers visit files dating from 1976 to 1982 provide profiles of ISR prepared for visits by senior UM officials. Also of note are the folders on ISR staff retreats and the Visiting Site Committee folders. The 1986 report of the external review committee, known as the "Tobin Report," and the reaction and discussion following the report are useful for insight into the goals as well as strengths and weaknesses of ISR in the mid-1980s.</p>

              <p>The University of Michigan Files (1.25 linear feet) date from 1946 to 1986 and include the correspondence of three ISR directors: Likert, Campbell and Juster. The files document, in part, the interaction between ISR and other university units and the involvement of ISR in university-wide activities. Of note are the Provost file, which contains correspondence relating to the establishment of SRC at UM and the Vice President for Academic Affairs file, for discussions of the use of general funds and salary policies.</p>

            <p>The Assistant Director's Topical Files consist of 2 linear feet of material and date from 1949 to 1989. They are primarily the files of James Wessell, although some files of Stanley Seashore are included. These files reflect the responsibilities of the assistant directors who had oversight of ISR policy and personnel. Of note are the Affirmative Action files, the files on the building addition, and tenure. The files of the Center Administrator Group document this group's focus on administrative issues, space needs of the staff, services and facilities, and the recommendations given to the Administrative Committee.</p>

          <p>The subgroup Center for Research on Utilization of Scientific Knowledge (CRUSK) dates from 1962 to 1985 and consists of 1.25 linear feet of material. There is good documentation in this series for the formative years of CRUSK, including transcripts for the planning sessions of the University Advisory Committee which met from 1962 to 1963. The Director's correspondence, although not complete, includes notes from Ronald Lippitt and others about the formative ideas of such a center. The reports are especially useful for the first six years of CRUSK, when the center was funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Documentation of the decision to close CRUSK in 1986 exists in the ISR Director's Topical Files and the ISR Executive Committee minutes.</p>

          <p>Research Center for Group Dynamics (RCGD) records date from 1936 to 1960, measure 1.75 linear feet and include primarily the papers of Director Kurt Lewin, including manuscripts and talks. The talks and manuscripts are arranged alphabetically although the titles given are a mix of the name of the talk and the place the talk was given. These documents are especially useful for insight into research Lewin was conducting on issues relating to minorities, especially the Jewish minority, and how he saw his research as contributing to social change in this arena. The correspondence with the Field Foundation is useful for documenting the initial years of RCGD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the UM correspondence documents communication between Dorwin Cartwright and UM before RCGD moved from MIT to UM.</p>

              <p>The Executive Committee was responsible for executive actions such as approving proposals, requesting use of overhead, appointing committees and receiving their reports. The minutes and agendas of this committee date from 1946 to 1982 and provide an excellent outline of issues of importance to SRC such as salary and promotion policies, the organization of SRC and its relationship to other units within ISR, and funding sources. There are gaps in the minutes for the 1960s.</p>

              <p>Rich documentation of SRC staff concerns and working relationships in the early years of the organization is available in the Senior Staff Discussions (1950-1953). Questions reflected in the discussions include what kinds of research SRC should be conducting, organization within the Center and the issue of programmatic research. The goals of the Center as a social science organization and its role in the international arena, discussions of proposals, its relationship to RCGD, how policy is formed in the Center and discussions of committee reports are all touched upon in these records.</p>

              <p>Correspondence is arranged in two segments, chronological and general. The chronological correspondence dates from 1976 to 1990 and is almost exclusively between ISR staff; it concerns meetings, issues relating to hiring and interviewing, and other administrative issues relating to SRC. The general correspondence dates from 1976 to 1990 and is primarily to and from individuals outside ISR. Arranged chronologically, it is useful for information on proposed surveys and projects as documented through correspondence with funding agencies. Correspondents also include potential researchers and visitors to ISR and those requesting information on the work of SRC.</p>

              <p>The Topical Files date from 1976 to 1990, with a gap from 1986 to 1989, and document the responsibilities of the SRC director in his role overseeing the research and administrative aspects of SRC as well as the interaction of SRC with other units in ISR. The files are arranged topically within each calendar year. Much of the information relates to the administrative details, especially financial, of various projects and programs. Included in the project and program files, however, are status reports and requests for additional resources which often provide an overview of specific research projects or discussions of proposed projects. One can also follow the development of various computer related projects within SRC, an integral part of the work done at ISR, by looking at the computer-related files for each year. They include documentation on the development of the Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing system and OSIRIS, an integrated system of general-purpose computer programs developed by the SRC and CPS computer support groups and designed to handle the large data sets and complex management and analysis procedures that typify much social research. The files on teaching document the courses taught each year by SRC staff and the policies files include discussions of various policies and their implementation within SRC.</p>

            <p>Policies, Press Releases and Reports includes policies for SRC, press releases on early research projects and reports from various SRC committees, primarily from the 1970s. Also included is an annual report for 1985/86. Policies and job descriptions for the years 1950 to 1987 are also in this portion of the records, although both do not exist for all years. Of note as well is a file of annual reviews done of senior staff in 1952/53.</p>

            <p>Projects initiated from 1946 to 1968 and proposals presented for review from 1972 to 1986 are included in the Project and Proposal Files. In the project files, which are arranged by project number and chronologically, only the earliest date in the file, usually the date of the proposal, is listed. The files often contain the proposal as well as correspondence relating to the project, and sometimes progress reports. The early studies contain additional documentation, such as survey questions and tabulating information, some of it artefactual in nature. The proposals are arranged chronologically and contain proposals from 1972 to 1986 submitted to the SRC Executive Committee for review. Collectively, the Project and Proposal files provide an excellent overview of the topics and nature of research at SRC and how it changed over the years.</p>
