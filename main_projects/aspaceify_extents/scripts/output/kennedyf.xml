      <p>Frank Robert Kennedy, a distinguished legal scholar on the subject of bankruptcy law, made a lifetime of contributions to the scholarship of bankruptcy law in the United States, and to the formation of bankruptcy law and procedures. His work in the field of bankruptcy over fifty years helped shape bankruptcy law and what was to become the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 through his involvement in many of the conferences and committees that drafted the legislation for congressional debate. He was a professor of bankruptcy law at the University of Iowa and at the University of Michigan. He taught bankruptcy law and related subjects at the University of Michigan from 1961 to 1984.</p>
      <p>Kennedy was born July 27, 1914, in Strafford, Missouri. He attended Southwest Missouri State University from 1931 to 1935 and received an A.B. and a teaching license. He received his law degree from Washington University School of Law, attending from 1936 to 1939. While at Washington University, he was first in his class all three years and was a member of the law review. It was while at Washington University that he took courses in secured transactions and debtor's estates. It was as a result of these classes that he decided to pursue his interests in bankruptcy and corporate reorganization. After completing his law degree, he received the Sterling Fellowship at Yale University Law School which allowed him to pursue a Juris Scientia Doctor (J.S.D), an advanced law degree. This was common practice at that time for those lawyers who wanted to become law professors. While at Yale, he was a protégé of J.W. Moore, a leading academician on Chapter X reorganization, and helped him revise Collier on Bankruptcy. Professor Moore also helped him gain membership to the National Bankruptcy Conference.</p>
      <p>World War II interrupted Kennedy's work on his J.S.D. thesis. He spent the war (1943-1946) in the Navy working as a personnel officer at the Naval Air Station, Quonset Point, Rhode Island. He became a law professor at the University of Iowa in 1940 and continued to work on his J.S.D. thesis which he successfully completed in 1953. He taught at the University of Iowa from 1940 to 1942 and 1946 to 1960. His primary subjects of instruction were: bankruptcy, secured transactions, creditor's rights, restitution, trade regulation, federal jurisdiction, and constitutional law.</p>
      <p>In addition to his academic career, he participated in the bankruptcy law profession as a member of committees and conferences whose mission it was to examine, supervise, and revise the bankruptcy laws and procedural bankruptcy rules of the United States. In this role, he has served as a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference (NBC) since 1947. The purpose of the NBC is to study bankruptcy case administration and develop needed amendments when requested by the United States House and Senate Judiciary Committees. As a member of the NBC he has acted as chairman of the Drafting Committee and member of the executive committee, 1959 and as secretary, 1981-1990. In 1959 he was also invited to become the reporter for the first Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States (ACBR), of which he was a member from 1960 to 1976. The ACBR was formed to draft rules of procedure for bankruptcy courts. This included drafting a statute that authorized the Supreme Court to promulgate procedural rules even if they conflicted with the existing Bankruptcy Act, an unusual grant of powers considering the separation of powers under the Constitution. This authority was later removed by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Professor Kennedy was appointed executive director of the Commission on Bankruptcy Laws (CBL) in 1970. The CBL was authorized by Congress to study the current bankruptcy laws and process. The CBL grew out of a long-standing issue in the legal community regarding the status of bankruptcy courts and whether the bankruptcy process should be an administrative rather than a judicial procedure. It held hearings all over the country regarding issues in bankruptcy law. In 1973, the CBL produced bankruptcy legislation to propose to Congress. Although the legislation did not pass that year, it helped to lay the foundation for the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.</p>
      <p>Professor Kennedy's relationship with the University of Michigan began in 1958 when he was a visiting professor. The university was looking for a professor in bankruptcy and reorganization after the death of professor Edgar Durfee, and Michigan persuaded him to return. He returned as a permanent professor in 1961, and remained at the university until 1984 when he was given emeritus status. He came to Michigan because of the opportunity to dedicate more of his teaching and scholarly time to bankruptcy-related issues. While at Michigan he taught creditor's rights, bankruptcy, reorganization, secured transactions, and consumer credit. He received the Distinguished Faculty Achievement award in 1971. He was named the Thomas M. Cooley Professor of Law in 1979. Over time he has contributed prodigious scholarship to the field of bankruptcy law by having almost 170 articles published in law reviews or contributed to legal treatises. In 1997 he was recognized for fifty years of membership in the Association of American University Professors.</p>
      <p>He also served as Of Counsel to Sidley &amp; Austin in Chicago, IL from 1983 to 1994. His civic involvement includes membership in the Ann Arbor Rotary Club where he served as president from 1979 to 1980.</p>

          <p>The sixth series, National Bankruptcy Conference, (7 linear feet) represents his 40-year membership in the Conference, and his work as chairman of the Drafting Committee. The first subseries tracks the history of the NBC prior to Kennedy's membership in papers from James MacLachlan, one of the first members of the NBC during the period which resulted in the Chandler Act. The Chandler Act was the first major bankruptcy legislation in the United States. This subseries consists of correspondence arranged in reverse chronological order. Correspondents included in this subseries are Henry Cabot Lodge, as well as other conferees, John Gerdes, Paul King, Watson Adair, Jacob Weinstein, Charles T. Adams, and W. Randolph Montgomery. The second subseries covers the period of Professor Kennedy's membership in the NBC and span 1954-1998. The subseries consists of annual meeting materials, correspondence, Drafting Committee materials and topical files. The annual meeting materials spans 1954-1998 with the bulk of the meetings represented from 1956 to 1979. In some cases the material covers two meetings held in the same year. The collection contains only a few examples of the summaries of proceedings that were produced following the meetings. The materials collected from the annual meetings include the reports of subcommittees, annotated agendas, executive committee papers, as well as some correspondence specifically related to the annual meetings. The correspondence is arranged in alphabetical order by the last name of the correspondent. Correspondents in this series include Vern Countryman and Charles Horsky. The Drafting Committee materials consist of reports, drafts and correspondence. The drafts and the correspondence are arranged in reverse chronological order. In the case of the correspondence, if a specific section of the Act is referenced in the letter it is noted in the upper right-hand corner of the letter. Members of this committee included Vern Countryman, professor of law at Harvard, and Lawrence King, law professor at New York University. The topical files include correspondence and reports in reverse chronological order. Topics include drafts of approved revisions of amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, American Bar Association committees, special meetings of the NBC, and the materials of special NBC committees.</p>

          <p>The seventh series, Other Organizational Affiliations, (.5 linear feet) contains materials from the many organizations where Professor Kennedy held membership. Many of the organizations represented are professional in nature, the Association of American Law Schools and the American Association of University Professors. Other organizations relate to law and bankruptcy -- the American Bar Association (ABA), the American Law Institute (ALI), American College of Bankruptcy, and Order of the Coif. The last organization listed is a community organization, Rotary.</p>
          <p>The ABA papers focus primarily on his work on the Ad Hoc Committee to Study the Federal Priority in Insolvency. Those papers are organized in reverse chronological order. For the most part they consist of correspondence with other members of the committee. The American College of Bankruptcy is an honorary professional and educational association of bankruptcy and insolvency professionals. The purpose of the organization is to set standards for achievement and professionalism. In 1996, Professor Kennedy was the first recipient of the College's Distinguished Service Award. The papers consist primarily of correspondence on bankruptcy issues. Professor Kennedy was a life member of the ALI, which is an educational association that promotes clarification and simplification of the law and encourages scholarly legal research. The papers consist primarily of newsletters, annual reports, and correspondence. The Rotary papers include chapter histories for the Ann Arbor, Michigan chapter and membership directories. There is also information regarding the establishment and operation of the chapter's endowment fund. There are also the personal Rotary papers of Professor Kennedy which include the certificate granted to him as a Paul Harris Fellow of Rotary International.</p>

          <p>The tenth series, Writings and Research, (9.5 linear feet) contains sub-series of articles, collected research, speeches, workshops, and research for lectures. The articles, speeches and workshops are all works written by Professor Kennedy. The collected research topics include: "Fresh Start" provisions, international comparative law of bankruptcy, and municipal debt adjustment. Also within the collected research sub-series is research done by Antonio Bautista, Professor Kennedy's research assistant from the Philippines, on the topics of the Uniform Commercial Code and bankruptcy, as well as the Bankruptcy Laws. Also included in collected research are six volumes of a casebook on creditors' rights written by Edgar Durfee, Professor Kennedy's predecessor at the University of Michigan, and inherited by Professor Kennedy when he came to Michigan. The final sub-series is the research for lectures, this is a collection of seven linear feet of articles, citations, and notes collected by Professor Kennedy from the 1960s through the 1980s. The series covers a wide range of topics in business law, creditor law, and commercial law. The papers were used as the basis for lectures and topics for discussion, as well as for background research for his writing.</p>
