    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The Sligh family of Grand Rapids, Michigan have been prominent businessmen and furniture makers for over one hundred years. The first generation of Slighs to come to western Michigan was <persname>James W. Sligh</persname> (1821-1963) who was a clothier and not a furniture maker. Immigrating from Scotland to Canada in 1833, and from there to Rochester, New York, in 1838, James W. Sligh finally settled in Grand Rapids in 1848. When civil war broke out, he entered service as captain with <corpname>Company F, 1st Michigan Engineers and Mechanics.</corpname> He died November 15, 1863, from injuries received from a train derailed by Confederate guerrillas.</p>
      <p>Though still a boy at the time of his father's death <persname>Charles R. Sligh</persname> (1850-1927) worked to help support his family. Following a series of odd jobs, Sligh was apprenticed for four years to a local tinsmith. He clerked for one year at the Foster and Stevens Hardware Store, and then in 1875, he went to work in the finishing room of Berkey and Gay, Grand Rapids furniture manufacturers. He was soon promoted to foreman of the finishing department and then became one of the salesmen for the company. Sligh was probably the first furniture salesman to make extensive use of photographs in his sales presentations. Up until that time, salesmen usually followed carloads of their companies' furniture into various cities along the train route. From the railroad yards, they would call the local dealers down to examine their wares, and sales would be made directly from the train. Using photographs enabled Sligh to open up new markets without being tied to the railroad.</p>
      <p>On February 24, 1880, Sligh and his brother-in-law <persname>Lewis Hawkins</persname> organized the <corpname>Sligh Furniture Company.</corpname> With Sligh as president and chief salesman, the company prospered and grew. In the 1890s, with bicycling a new and popular fad, Sligh attempted to diversify his company to include the manufacture of bicycle wheels. This venture proved a failure, and thereafter, Sligh devoted most of his business energies to furniture manufacturing in general and the Sligh Company in particular. He developed new sources for the mahogany needed in his production by organizing a company which cut lumber in Honduras and then transported it to Grand Rapids. He established an agency in England for the sale of his furniture. He was president of the <corpname>National Furniture Manufacturers Association</corpname> (1888-1892), and was for many years president of the <corpname>Grand Rapids Furniture Manufacturers Association</corpname>. And in 1900, when his supply of mirror glass was restricted by a cartel of French, German, and Belgian manufacturers, Sligh traveled to Europe and sought out a supply of glass from a number of small, independent Belgian manufacturers.</p>
      <p>With his company well established, Sligh began to devote more of his time and effort to politics and public service. He was a member of the Grand Rapids Board of Education in 1882 and 1883, and was active in local Republican politics. In 1895, Sligh split with his party over the question of bimetallism. He advocated free silver and was one of the organizers of the <corpname>Silver Republican Party in Michigan</corpname>. In 1896, he was nominated by the Free Silver Republicans, the Democrats, and the Populists to be the fusion candidate for governor. He was defeated in this election by Hazen Pingree. In 1906, Sligh ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Grand Rapids. In 1912, Governor Chase S. Osborn appointed him to the state's Workmen's Compensation Commission; and in 1915, he was made a member of the Grand Rapids Charter Commission which drafted that city's charter. Sligh was elected state senator for his district in 1922, and in 1924, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican gubernatorial primary.</p>
      <p>Sligh was also involved in local philanthropic pursuits, including the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, and the planning for a proposed (but never completed) Sligh Memorial Hospital for Children. Among other business interests, Sligh was president of the <corpname>Santiam Land and Timber Co.</corpname>, president of the <corpname>Clark-Sligh Timber Co.</corpname>, and secretary-treasurer of the <corpname>Clark Iron Co.</corpname>, which had large holdings of mineral lands in the Mesabi Range. Sligh died September 15, 1927.</p>
      <p>With his death and worsening business conditions in the furniture industry, the Sligh Furniture Company floundered and failed. Its assets were liquidated in 1932. <persname>Charles R. Sligh, Jr.</persname> (1906- ) who had gained experience in his father's business, was forced to begin anew a business which would have the family name. In 1933, this Sligh together with O.W. Lowry, who had been the company's superintendent, pooled their resources to purchase an idle furniture factory in Holland, Michigan. The <corpname>Charles R. Sligh Company</corpname> gradually grew. In 1940, the two men opened another plant (the Sligh-Lowry Company) in Zeeland, Michigan. This was followed in 1945 by a third company, the <corpname>Grand Rapids Chair Company</corpname>, then by a fourth, the <corpname>Sligh Furniture Showrooms</corpname> in New York City.</p>
      <p>Charles R. Sligh, Jr., like his father, was concerned with national economic issues. As a skilled debater, he became a spokesman first for the furniture industry and then for all of American business through his work with the NAM, the <corpname>National Association of Manufacturers</corpname>. Sligh was chairman of the NAM's taxation committee, and in 1952 was vice president of the NAM's Michigan-Ohio region. He was elected president of the NAM in December 1952, and after his term expired in December 1953, he was elected chairman of the NAM Executive Board. In April 1957, he was elected chief administrative officer and executive vice president of the organization. While with NAM, Sligh gained fame as spokesman for the business point of view in a series of debates with labor leaders, notably <persname>George Meany</persname> and <persname>Walter Reuther</persname>.</p>
      <p>Though a Republican like his father, Charles Sligh Jr. never ran for high public office, preferring instead to express his political views through his NAM activities. He did serve as chairman of the Kent County Republican Party in 1952 and was an acquaintance of many national Republican leaders.</p>
      <p><persname>Robert Lewis Sligh</persname> (1928-2012), was Charles Jr.' son. Robert "Bob" Sligh got his first job as a hand sander at the <corpname>Baker Furniture, Inc.</corpname> in Holland, Mich. in 1945 at the age of 17. In 1946 he enrolled in the Furniture Course at the University of Michigan, a course established by Charles R. Sligh Jr. and Chuck Kindel of <corpname>Kindel Furniture</corpname>. The course was headquartered in the Wood Technology Department of the Forestry School. Robert Sligh graduated with a B.S. in Wood Technology in 1949, followed by a summer at Wright-Peterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, becoming a Reserve Air Force officer. Robert Sligh served with the 32nd Air Division Defense as Officer in Charge of Intelligence Flight. In 1954 he was released from active duty and joined the Sligh-Lowry as Assistant to the Sales Manager. Two years later he was promoted to Sales Manager of Sligh-Lowry reporting to Bill Lowry, the Vice President. He became the Sligh Company's President in 1968 and continued in this capacity until 1990.</p>

          <p>The first series covers the period 1842-1865 and largely concerns the activities of James W. Sligh, though there is also a mixture of his son's papers (James M. Sligh), particularly during the period of the Civil War. The files have been arranged into three subseries: correspondence, business receipts and related materials, and bound records, principally daybooks and account books, and Civil War diaries. The correspondence for the 1860s includes the letters written by James W. and James M. Sligh when they served with the 1st Michigan Engineers and Mechanics as well as scattered letters which were written by the following men: <persname>Sidney Abbot</persname>, <persname>Charles Cudney</persname>, <persname>Edson Gifford</persname>, <persname>Enos Hopkins</persname>, <persname>William Innes</persname>, <persname>David Jewell</persname>, <persname>Don Lighthall</persname>, <persname>John McGrath</persname>, <persname>Clement Miller</persname>, <persname>William Nevins</persname>, <persname>George Walker</persname>, <persname>Walder Warner</persname>, <persname>Albert Wells</persname>, and <persname>George White</persname>.</p>

          <p>The second series covers the period 1866-1927 and centers around the career of <persname>Charles R.

Sligh's first wife, <persname>Mary Stowell Sligh</persname> and her family. The bulk of this series, however, relates to the business and political activities of Charles R. Sligh. There are three subseries here, consisting of correspondence, business and political materials, and bound records, principally political scrapbooks, business and land records, personal account books and diaries, and a volume written by Sligh containing a combination family history and <genreform>autobiography</genreform>. Among the topics covered in this series are the Grand River improvement scheme (1889-1905); the furniture industry (especially 1887-1890, 1911, and 1926); the Grand Rapids mayoralty election of 1906; the <subject>state constitutional convention</subject> in 1907; the election of 1912; <subject>World War I</subject>, including the preparedness movement, the <geogname>Plattsburg Training Camp</geogname>, the <corpname>National Security League</corpname>, and airplane production; Sligh's election to and activities in the <corpname>Michigan State Senate</corpname>, 1922-1924; the gubernatorial primary election of 1924; and miscellaneous business investments in California and Arizona, especially in the California Land and Water Co., the Lakeview Oil Co., the Interstate Oil Co. of California, and a variety of Arizona irrigation and land companies (1920-1927).</p>

          <p>The third series of the Sligh papers largely concerns the interests of Charles R. Sligh, Jr. (1928-1967) There is early scattered material, approximately 1928-1939, concerning the estate of his father, but the bulk of the materials covers the 1940s and 1950s, and relates to his involvement in the <corpname>National Association of Manufacturers</corpname> and his interest in national economic policy. There are several subseries, including correspondence, papers, speeches, audio-tapes and phonograph records of NAM speeches and programs, and bound records, including scrapbooks concerning his furniture business, his NAM activities, and his interest in water-skiing, and personal financial ledgers. Correspondents in this series include <persname>Clyde H. Geerlings</persname>, <persname>John A. Hannah</persname>, <persname>George Meany</persname>, and <persname>Arthur H. Summerfield</persname>.</p>
