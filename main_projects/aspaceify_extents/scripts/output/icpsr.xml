      <p>The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) is an organization of member institutions that provides access to the world's largest archive of computer-based and instructional data for the social sciences. Its primary purposes are to 1) acquire, develop, archive, and disseminate social science data and documentation, and 2) offer training in quantitative social analysis. ICPSR has over 325 members in the United States and Canada and serves hundreds of institutions in Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Latin America. Headquarters and central staff of ICPSR are located at the University of Michigan. Although originally conceived to meet the needs of political analysts, ICPSR serves a wide spectrum of social scientists, including economists, sociologists, psychologists, geographers, and historians, as well as other specialists in education, public health, social work, public administration, urban affairs, foreign policy, business administration, law, criminal justice, and gerontology.</p>
      <p>The Inter-university Consortium for Political Research (ICPR) was founded in the summer of 1962 as a partnership between the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan and twenty-one universities in the United States. Warren Miller, director of the Political Behavior Program of ISR, became director of the ICPR. ICPR addressed several current problems, including the increasing amounts of political science data collected by a variety of investigators and agencies, the duplication of effort gathering data, and the lack of availability of data to other researchers. One catalyst for cooperation was the development of computer technologies for rapid processing of large amounts of quantitative data. The first members affirmed the following four objectives:</p>
      <p>(1) the development of data resources; (2) the establishment of a formal training program for graduate students and faculty; (3) the stimulation and facilitation of new research; and (4) the operation of a clearinghouse for the improved communication of information about ongoing research.</p>
      <p>To implement its goals, a council of five representatives was chosen to work with the Survey Research Center (SRC). Furthermore, a summer program for faculty and graduate students was planned for 1963. A computer for data processing was acquired, and ICPR processed data and distributed code and analysis books for SRC studies and other accessions. ICPR also obtained funding to develop a major data repository. Finally, it planned publications to coordinate research and publicize ICPR.</p>
      <p>Within the next decade, ICPR concentrated on increasing the number of collections in the data archives beyond SRC's survey data and building a technological infrastructure for storing, processing, and retrieving data. It also expanded professional research training and increased their membership <title render="italic">.</title> Advisory committees, composed of leading researchers from member institutions, were formed to develop subject-specific data archives for the repository, such as the Survey Research Archive and the Historical Archive. The staff at ICPR also increased to manage the data archives, input the raw data into machine-readable form, program the computers, provide hardware and software consultation, and furnish complex combinations or computations according to researchers' requests. As membership grew, membership structure was revised into categories based on facilities. Each member institution had one representative on a committee of representatives, which served to elect a council of ten.</p>
      <p>In 1970, the Political Behavior Program of ISR became a center in its own right, known as the Center for Political Studies (CPS). ICPR was housed in CPS, although decisions were still made by the ICPR board. Warren Miller became director of CPS, and Richard Hofferbert later became head of ICPR. In 1975, Jerome Clubb assumed directorship of ICPR. At this time, the name was changed to Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) to reflect the increasingly multi-disciplinary focus of its resources. Under Clubb, data holdings were expanded in the fields of social and political history, international relations, quality of life, work patterns, historical and contemporary consumer attitudes, and the roles of women. ICPSR relied heavily on outside funding for augmenting existing data collections and building new ones. In addition, ICPSR provided networked access to its resources and accommodated microcomputers using data. Furthermore, the educational mission was broadened to include undergraduates. Membership reached over 240 institutions by 1979.</p>
      <p>The 1980s saw new challenges and opportunities for ICPSR. ICPSR faced greater magnitudes of data with increasing complexity, changes in computing technology, and the institutional distribution of social scientists. Because many institutions lacked the software and hardware to manipulate new forms of data, ICPSR was well positioned to supply specific subsets of data in forms compatible with members' computing systems. To meet the increasing popularity of microcomputers, ICPSR concentrated resources on the development of exportable computing technologies. Indexing was also improved to help researchers identify consortium data remotely. Moreover, the development of the Consortium Data Network and the National Science Foundation Network enhanced transfer and dissemination of consortium data. By automating processing and documentation, converting documentation into machine-readable form, and providing on-line storage for documentation and data, ICPSR thereby eliminated the need for tapes and human management. Throughout these changes, ICPSR remained committed to instructing professionals and students in quantitative analysis methodologies in the context of social science research. ICPSR also continued to acquire, process, and disseminate data collections on a wide variety of topics, including the census, media polls, health, aging, election returns, and criminal justice. In 1989, ICPSR had over 340 member institutions.</p>
      <p>In the 1990s under the leadership of Richard C. Rockwell, ICPSR continued to grapple with the rapidly changing technology environment. A foremost priority was the distribution of data sets to users' desktop computers, either through the Internet or CD-ROMs. Other paramount concerns were data migration and the adoption of lasting hardware and software standards. Nevertheless, ICPSR continued to emphasize its commitment to promote and facilitate research and instruction in the social sciences. They also underscored its purpose as a central data repository and dissemination service, and developed proactive acquisitions policies to respond to changes in the social sciences.</p>
      <p>Because ISR administers the activities of the ICPSR, the researcher should also consult the records of ISR at the Bentley Historical Library. Current information about ICPSR, including council minutes, membership structure, the constitution, and mission statement, is available on its web site (as of 2007) at:</p>

          <p>The Organization and Administration series, (1962-2005, 6.0 linear feet) contains documentation from 1962 to 2005. The series is organized alphabetically. Organizational charts have been placed at the beginning of the series. Documentation of ICPSR committees is very strong, especially for earlier years. Included here is the 1962 "memorandum of organization." It served as the constitution. Various revisions of the memorandum of organization are contains here (1963, 1967, 1970, 1973, 1981, 1982). In 1991 a formal constitution and bylaws was created along with a memorandum of agreement between ICPSR and ISR. The advisory committee files mostly contain correspondence among scholars at various institutions who directed acquisition of data sets. These files document acquisition decisions and provide insight into the changing priorities of the data archives. Reports and surveys in these files show the status of the data archives at various points in time. Records of the Summer Program Advisory Committee complement materials in the separate Educational Activities series. Other committee files contain internal administrative records, including documentation of strategic planning decisions and revisions to the constitution and bylaws. Also included in this series are summary budget reports, and information about the membership structure.</p>

          <p>The Meetings series, (1965-2007, 8.0 linear feet) consists of materials from various types of governance meetings held by ICPSR from 1965 to 2007. Materials from Council, Official Representative, and other meetings included here, consist of agendas, lists of attendees, meeting minutes and background materials. The largest part of the series contains Council meeting materials. The Council is made up of twelve people elected by the ICPSR members, and tends to consist of scholars and data professionals. Six new Council members are elected every two years to serve four-year terms. The Council meetings are currently held three times annually, though in the earlier days of ICPSR they were held more frequently. The Council serves as the executive committee of the members and is authorized to act on their behalf in matters pertaining to budgetary, administrative, and organizational policies and procedures for ICPSR.</p>
          <p>Materials from the meetings of Official Representatives constitute the second-largest portion of this series. As a membership organization, each ICPSR member institution is represented by a locally designated "official representative." These Official Representatives ("ORs") met annually in Ann Arbor from 1963-1975, and then biennially from 1977 onward. (The 1972, 1974, and 1981 OR meetings were cancelled). These meetings are intended to inform representatives about current ICPSR activities. In a letter from June 2004 (located in the donor file), Erik Austin described the value of the materials from these meetings in the following way: "Over the years, the ICPSR staff has 'pointed to' these periodic meetings of ORs as an opportunity to summarize present and future developments and activities of the ICPSR. Documents prepared for the periodic OR meetings, therefore, provide capsule summaries of the activities in which ICPSR has engaged, and the deliberations at these meetings condition policies and future directions that the organization has taken."</p>

          <p>The Individual Council Chairs' Papers series (1988-2002, 1.0 linear feet) consists of materials from five former Chairs of the ICPSR Council (representing the time period from 1988 to 2002), which were solicited for the archives by Erik Austin, former Director of Archival Development. The papers document primarily the time period during which the individual served as Council Chair, but they also pertain to activities the individual may have participated in when serving as a regular council member, or in another capacity associated with the ICPSR. The contents of the collection vary from individual to individual, but contain primarily correspondence relating to various topics (notably, many of the Council Chairs' papers contain material on governance documents, such as the Memorandum of Agreement).</p>

          <p>The Grants and Project Proposals series, (1963-2003, 3.5 linear feet) covers the period 1963-2002. The series is organized chronologically, with the most recent grant proposals at the end of the series. At the beginning of the series, there is an index of all ICPSR grant proposals, compiled by Erik Austin (Director of Archival Development) in 2005. Austin's list is reasonably complete, however, he notes that his list is lacking in proposals from 2001-2002, and there are several earlier grant proposals that exist in the collection that are also not on his list. The series includes information on both nascent ideas and successfully implemented projects. The grant proposals provide a synthesized narrative about ICPSR's significance to various areas of social science. They also provide documentation about the purposes of various data archives, the history of ICPSR's development, and technological advancements.</p>

          <p>The Educational Activities series, (.75 linear feet) includes materials from 1967 to 1991, with a concentration in the 1970s and 1980s. The series mostly contains documentation of the summer workshops on data librarianship and management. The records contain a variety of materials, including correspondence, lecture notes, handouts, course evaluations, workbooks, bibliographies, computer software manuals, and course descriptions. Documentation of the other summer training workshops is sparse.</p>
