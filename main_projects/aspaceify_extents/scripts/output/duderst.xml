      <p>Nuclear engineer and eleventh President of the University of Michigan, James J. Duderstadt worked both to position the university as a leader in higher education and to transform the university into a new institutional "model" for higher education --an institutional model that could readily adapt to the changing needs of society.</p>
      <p>Born on December 5, 1942 in Iowa, Duderstadt was raised in Carollton, Missouri, a small farming community of 4,000 persons. Duderstadt earned his B.S. in electrical engineering (summa cum laude), Yale University (1964); M.S. in engineering science, California Institute of Science (1965); and Ph.D. in engineering science and physics, California Institute of Technology (1967). Duderstadt's dissertation won the American Nuclear Society Mark Mills award, an honor presented to the nation's most outstanding Ph.D. dissertation in nuclear science and engineering. He married a high school classmate, Anne Marie Lock, in 1964. The Duderstadts have two daughters: Susan and Katharine.</p>
      <p>After completing his master's and doctoral degrees in just three years, Duderstadt held a postdoctoral fellowship at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission located in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The project involved the development of a nuclear rocket intended to fly to Mars. However, the NASA project lost funding, and in 1969 Duderstadt accepted an appointment as assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Duderstadt was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 1972 and achieved the status of full professor in 1976.</p>
      <p>In the classroom, Duderstadt was the recipient of many awards for both his teaching and research efforts including Outstanding Nuclear Engineering Educator Award in 1974 and College of Engineering Outstanding Teacher in 1980. He was the primary supervisor for twenty-two doctoral dissertations, co-authored several engineering textbooks, and published over sixty journal articles in the areas of nuclear reactor theory, radiation transport, kinetic theory and statistical mechanics, plasma physics, and computer simulation.</p>
      <p>In 1981, Professor Duderstadt was appointed dean of the University of Michigan's College of Engineering. At age 38, he was the youngest person ever to be appointed dean in the history of the college. His appointment occurred at the same time the state of Michigan was suffering from a downturn in the economy due to the effects of a national recession in the automobile industry. However, despite the economic atmosphere of the early 1980s, Duderstadt established the college as a "high priority" both in the university and in the state. He secured additional financial support from state, corporate, and private sources. During this period, the College of Engineering general fund went from $11 million to $34 million; private fund-raising grew from $2 million per year to $7 million per year; and federal and industrial sponsored research support rose from $16 million per year to $36 million per year during the last year of his tenure.</p>
      <p>As dean of the College of Engineering, Duderstadt was also instrumental in the development of several high technology research initiatives. Major programmatic initiatives included: The Center for Research on Integrated Manufacturing; The Center for Machine Intelligence; The Center for Advanced Electronics and Optics Technology; and the Computer Aided Engineering Network (CAEN). Academic programs introduced under his direction were the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Applied Physics programs.</p>
      <p>By 1986, Duderstadt had "rebuilt" the Engineering campus and reestablished the prestige of the college within the university and state of Michigan. In that spring, Duderstadt stated, "The job in Engineering is winding down. We've accomplished what we set out to do." That spring he was appointed University of Michigan's Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.</p>
      <p>As provost, Duderstadt's role was that of chief academic and chief budget officer. He also held approval responsibility for all faculty and academic staff appointments. The composition of the Ann Arbor campus at that time included 35,000 students, 3400 faculty, 15,000 staff members, a total operating budget of $1.2 billion per year, and a General Fund budget of $430 million per year.</p>
      <p>Duderstadt's appointment to Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs marked another "first" at the University. He was the first engineer to be appointed to this position. Duderstadt's appointment began during the final year of the university's "Five Year Plan" a plan focused on budget reallocation and reduction implemented by the university in reaction to a dramatic decrease in state support that began in the early 1980s. As provost, Duderstadt worked to shift the university's stance from "reactive to pro-active" by instilling an approach towards the external environment that was challenging rather than threatening. To achieve this objective, he implemented a series of well planned strategic retreats with key university administrators and academic units.</p>
      <p>Duderstadt was just in the second year of his appointment as provost when President Harold Shapiro announced on April 28, 1987 that he had accepted the presidency at Princeton University. Former President Robben W. Fleming served as Interim President and on June 10, 1988, the Regents of the University named James J. Duderstadt the 11th president of the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>As president of the university, Duderstadt maintained a full steam ahead, energetic management style. He can be credited for instituting several changes in the cultural and physical landscape of Michigan. Most significantly, Duderstadt worked to alter the ethnic and racial composition of students, faculty, and staff at the university. His vision was to "build a community that values and respects and, indeed, draws its intellectual strength from the rich diversity of peoples of different races, cultures, religions, nationalities, and beliefs." His vision of a multicultural community for the twenty-first century resulted in a strategic plan for the university titled <title render="italic">The Michigan Mandate: A Strategic Linking of Academic Excellence and Social Diversity</title>. In addition to the "Michigan Mandate," Duderstadt worked to create a more equitable environment for women at the university as evidenced in "The Michigan Agenda." In this paper, Duderstadt challenged the university -- "By the Year 2000, the University of Michigan will become the leader among American universities in promoting and achieving the success of women of diverse backgrounds as faculty, students, and staff." Taken together, the Michigan Mandate and the Michigan Agenda outlined his vision for the future of minorities and women at the university.</p>
      <p>The contours of the campus landscape also shifted significantly during the Duderstadt tenure. New construction, renovation, and major improvements were realized through an enthusiastic fund-raising campaign called the "Campaign for Michigan." The Campaign effort raised over $1 billion dollars and paved the way for the implementation of a major plan to strengthen the university's infrastructure. In sum, the Campaign effort led to the rebuilding of the Central and Medical campuses, expansion of the North Campus, renovation of the Athletic Campus, and the development of a landscaping plan for the entire campus. New construction included the Lurie Engineering Center, the Media Union, Cancer and Geriatrics Center, Institute of Continuing Legal Education, and the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Building for Aerospace Research.</p>
      <p>In addition to his efforts in shaping the campus both culturally and physically, Duderstadt can also be credited with overseeing the development of several research initiatives. A selection of new initiatives includes the Media Union, the Institute for the Humanities, the Institute of Molecular Medicine, and the Davidson Institute for Emerging Economies.</p>
      <p>On September 27, 1995, President Duderstadt shocked the university community with the announcement that he would be leaving the position effective June 30, 1996. In an open letter to the community announcing his decision Duderstadt stated, "Working together, we have indeed built a truly extraordinary university. But we have built a university for the twentieth century, and that century is rapidly coming to an end. It is now time to lead the University in new directions, to transform ourselves to better serve a rapidly changing world. And I believe that such new directions may benefit best from new leadership, fresh visions, and untapped energy."</p>
      <p>Upon his departure as president of the University of Michigan, Duderstadt returned to the classroom as Professor of Science and Technology at Michigan. In addition, he heads the Millennium Project. The Millennium Project is a research center in the Media Union concerned with the impact of technology on research and teaching. Information about current research and a selection of Duderstadt's "legacy documents" are available on-line at: [http://milproj.ummu.umich.edu].</p>

      <p>The James J. Duderstadt papers (19 linear feet and 160.5 megabytes in 2,144 computer files) span the years from 1963 to 1997, although the bulk of the material covers 1970 to 1996. The collection, consisting mainly of Speeches, Position Papers, and Presentations, effectively documents Duderstadt's vision, agenda, and planning process. There are two subgroups in the collection: Paper Documents and Digital Documents.</p>
      <p>The Paper Documents subgroup is comprised of ten series: Biographical / Background Material, Speeches and Accompanying Material, Computer Printouts of Speeches, Position Papers, Publications, Presentations, Correspondence, Research, Topical Files (Pre-Presidency), and Teaching. It includes a few papers from his years as engineering dean and his term as provost, along with a substantial amount of material from his years as professor of nuclear engineering and as president of the university.</p>
      <p>A second subgroup, Digital Documents, is comprised of material created and maintained in electronic form (utilizing a number of software programs), and is particularly strong for representing Duderstadt's entire term as president of the university. The subgroup includes eight series: Speeches, Idea Files, Strategy, Position Papers, Presentations, Write Files and Legacy Files. The digital files of speeches and position papers frequently contain various and well-organized iterations of key documents. Of particular note are the Strategy Files, which hold substantial planning documents, many designed to encourage and promote vigorous response to change at many levels within the university. The subgroup also contains a series of Digital Images, most of which appeared in the 1996 publication <title render="italic">Rebuilding the University: 1986-1996.</title></p>

          <p>The material in the James J. Duderstadt Paper Documents subgroup was transferred to the Bentley Historical Library shortly after Duderstadt's presidency at the University of Michigan ended in 1996. It includes a few papers from his years as engineering dean and his term as provost, along with a substantial amount of material from his years as professor of nuclear engineering and as president of the university. Researchers should note that there is also paper documentation specific to the Duderstadt presidency (as well as audio and visual material) held at the Bentley in the following record groups: University of Michigan, President; University of Michigan, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs; and the College of Engineering. The Paper Documents subgroup is organized into ten series:</p>

            <p>The Biographical / Background Material (.50 linear ft., 1970-1996), including resume, newspaper clippings, personnel papers, and some correspondence, although sparse, provides context and background to the other series in the subgroup. This series contains detailed biographical data and lists of published work for 1968 to 1996. Additional papers for the years 1981 to 1987 chronicle Duderstadt's rise from 1981 at age 38 as the youngest dean in the history of the College of Engineering to 1987, the year before he became eleventh president of the university.</p>

            <p>The Speeches and Accompanying Material series (4.50 linear ft., 1981-1992) is by far the bulk of the subgroup, containing files created during Duderstadt's provost years through the earlier half of his tenure as president. There are speeches in the series for the years 1986 through 1992, with the greatest concentration 1988 to 1990. During these later years Duderstadt often gave numerous speeches a day across the state and on the Michigan campus. Topics range widely from key policy statements, such as various iterations of the Michigan Mandate, to legislative addresses and routine welcomes and alumni addresses.</p>
            <p>The speeches are, for the most part, arranged chronologically with approximately one foot arranged by subject. The files in this series are particularly valuable because they are enriched with "accompanying material" --guest lists, programs, correspondence, notes, overheads, various versions of the same speech, annotated copies of speeches and drafts, and similar documents. It is sometimes possible to trace the evolution of an idea or to gather understanding of the audience for which a speech was prepared. Particularly for completeness (and also for more efficient subject access across the files through keyword searching) researchers interested in Duderstadt speeches should also review the large number of speech files in the Digital Documents subgroup.</p>

            <p>Computer Printouts of Speeches (3 linear ft., 1988-1994) are printouts for the years 1988 to 1990 and 1992 to 1994. As such, they are often duplicates to the Speeches and Accompanying Materials series, but hold none of the contextual data. Most are dated, but there is no documentation as to whether this is a printout date or the date of creation. Researchers should note that many of the printouts are also available electronically, along with relevant data about them, in the Digital Documents subgroup. While this may on the surface seem redundant, preserving versions demonstrates some of the ways Duderstadt's office functioned, particularly in the evolving years of electronic record keeping. It becomes evident when the paper series are considered alongside the digital versions, that Duderstadt's office became over the years, more and more committed to functioning wholly in the electronic realm. Finally, since the papers were not processed at an item level, keeping these diverse versions offers the best likelihood that the collection will fairly comprehensively hold most of Duderstadt's speeches for this period.</p>

            <p>The Position Papers (.25 linear ft., 1984-1991) are sets of documents in expandable folders, each focusing on a specific topic and each with a listing of its contents. The files are a combination of Duderstadt authored papers (some published in booklet form) and background material and articles about the subjects. Topics pertain to public service and the university; values, community, civility (diversity and the Michigan Mandate, for example); positions on vision and mission (includes 1986 environmental assessment); papers on acquisition and management of resources; and articles and papers on teaching and undergraduate education. As might be expected, this is an excellent source for attaining a broad view of the Duderstadt presidency. There is a master list to all of the documents in the first folder in the series.</p>

            <p>The Publications series, along with Position Papers, is a fine source for obtaining overviews of the goals and accomplishments of Duderstadt's presidency. These several items, published toward the end of Duderstadt's years in office are collectively entitled Legacy Documents. Handsomely housed in a hand-crafted clamshell box, the fourteen publications highlight the dramatic agenda pursued by the university under Duderstadt leadership from 1988-1996. Many of Duderstadt's speeches initially created in an outline form, which he considered the "poetic" version, are here finely reproduced in what he called the "full-prose" version.</p>

            <p>The Correspondence series (1.5 linear ft., ca. 1967-1982) is largely comprised of correspondence between Duderstadt and various publishers regarding the publication of his numerous manuscripts and textbooks. The series also contains letters from a number of research fellows who wrote Duderstadt with updates on their research. The folder titled Ziya Akcasu is an example of the type of correspondence one will find in this series. The series is largely comprised of incoming correspondence.</p>

            <p>The Research series (6.0 linear ft., ca. 1969-1981), along with the Teaching series, provides an excellent reflection of Duderstadt's academic pursuits in nuclear engineering. The series contains a number of Air Force Office Scientific Research and National Science Foundation grant files as well as manuscripts and related materials for over fifty published manuscripts. The series also includes a sample of the reference files Duderstadt maintained on various nuclear engineering topics such as energy and rarefied dynamics. Overall, the series is a good example of nuclear engineering research activity in the 1970s as well as Duderstadt's role in the education of students at all levels. His keen interest in education can be seen in the development of an undergraduate engineering textbook authored with G.F. Knoll and G.S. Springer titled <title render="italic">Principles of Engineering</title> and through his role in the development of the nuclear engineering program at Michigan.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files (1.50 linear ft., 1971-1991) is limited in scope, holding papers mainly from Dr. Duderstadt's involvement on various committees within the Department of Nuclear Engineering. The bulk of these materials are from the years just preceding his appointment to Dean of the College of Engineering. An interesting, yet not dated, written document titled, "Thoughts on A Rainy Day, on moving the College of Engineering to North Campus" may be the initial seed for the ultimate move of the College of Engineering from central campus to the North Campus in the mid-1980s. The remainder of the series is comprised of papers associated with his term as provost. The largest file is entitled "Contacts," and includes memos, cards and letters, message slips, lists of meeting attendees, hand-written notes, and other miscellany. Of particular significance is a list of key activities for 1981 to 1985 relating to Duderstadt's accomplishments in the College of Engineering, and the farewell address (with annotations) that he gave to engineering staff upon leaving. Also important are notes entitled "Vision of the University" that Duderstadt prepared while he was being considered for the provost position. In addition, there is a small correspondence file, significant partly because there is so little "traditional" correspondence from his year's as president in the collection as a whole. The 2003 accession added one linear feet of material concerning Duderstadt's role on the National Science Board in the early 1990s.</p>

            <p>The Teaching series (2.5 linear ft., ca. 1971-1981) works hand-in-hand with the Research series. Where the Research series shows Duderstadt's intense interest in scientific discovery, the Teaching series shows how he conveyed this knowledge to a broad audience. The series contains nuclear engineering lecture material and assignments as well as material on seminars taught by Duderstadt such as the UM-Bendix Engineering Summer conference and the Consumer's Power Nuclear Engineering Program that was held in 1980. The series also contains background materials and scripts for the University of Michigan Television Center program <title render="italic">"Nuclear Power and You"</title> that was taped in the late 1970s and which featured Duderstadt.</p>

            <p>The Presidential Transition Files series (2.0 linear feet, ca. 1988) consists largely of the working files of the inauguration committee for the 11th President of the University of Michigan. These files include material on the invitation list, program, seating arrangements and other logistical issues. In addition to working files, the series contains some correspondence to Duderstadt on the announcement of his appointment as 11th President of the University of Michigan, the inauguration address, and thanks you's sent from the Duderstadt's after the inauguration. Newsclippings relating to the inauguration are especially complete and arranged chronologically by month. Also of particular note are printed materials designed especially for the inauguration and related events. Printed material includes the invitation and program</p>

          <p>There are 2,144 digital files (160.5 MB) in the Digital Documents subgroup. At the time of the records accession to the Bentley Historical Library, the Macintosh operating system version 8.0 was in use. The original organization and arrangement of Duderstadt's digital files has been preserved. Duderstadt maintained seven archival directories: Speeches, Idea Files, Strategy, Position Papers, Presentations, Write Files, and Legacy. An additional series, Digital Images, was created when a collection of digital images of university building projects was accessioned to the collection early in 1998.</p>
          <p>The arrangement of files within each directory is chronological by date starting with the 1986-1987 school year. This arrangement was designed and used by Duderstadt in the Speeches, Idea Files, and Write Files series and extended to the remaining series except the Digital Images during the processing phase of the project. The directory naming scheme effectively describes the type of record contained within the directory. File names are also in most cases descriptive of the content, however, researchers should note that Duderstadt used personal last names, initials, abbreviations, and numerous acronyms in naming files. A list of commonly used acronyms and abbreviations used for file naming purposes can be found in the "Additional Descriptive Data" section of the finding aid. Researcher's Note: The file-naming scheme also reveals the specific version of a particular document. Duderstadt maintained the file name for the record and added a sequence of numbers to the file name to indicate various versions. For example, the record "Project Athena" progresses from Project Athena .92, Project Athena 1.0, 1.01, 1.2, 2.1, to Project Athena 2.21.</p>

            <p>A main avenue President Duderstadt utilized as a means to communicate his ideas, objectives, and university strategic plan was to get out into the community and talk. During his presidency, Duderstadt frequently made several speeches a day to groups on campus and across the state, thus making the Speeches series (821 files, 1986-1996) the largest series in the Digital Documents subgroup. The early speech files from the years 1986 to 1992 were predominately composed using the MORE 3.1 outline program. However, after 1992 he drafted his speeches using a combination of MORE 3.1 and Microsoft Word 6.0. Major Speeches contained in this series include: The Cranbrook Address, The Challenge of K-12 Education, February, 1990, American Nuclear Society Keynote Address, A Future of Change, April, 1992, State Equity in Education Conference, The Michigan Mandate: A Progress Report, March, 1993, Vision 2017: The Third Century, November, 1993.</p>
            <p>Researchers should note that a list of key speeches by title, year, and location can be found in the digital file titled "Accomplishments" located in the Strategy series. Also, note that several iterations of particular speeches can be found in the Digital Documents subgroup. Duderstadt's file naming scheme reflects the change in a file by a series of numbers located after the file name.</p>

            <p>The Idea Files series (328 digital files, 1986-1995) is comprised of files created with the MORE 3.1 outline program. Many of the outline files in this series resemble a silhouette of ideas that Duderstadt later developed into strategic planning documents, position papers, and speeches. Other outlines in the series read as talking points Duderstadt used either to prepare for a meeting or an important conversation. Major topics addressed in this series include higher education, teaching and research, information technology, and affirmative action. Yearly progress reports on the status of Duderstadt's agenda and goals can be found within this series in files with titles such as "Summary 1991-92" or "The Year Past." Researchers interested in additional biographical material should consult the digital file "Biography" in the 1988-1989 Ideas subseries and the Biographical series in the Paper Documents subgroup.</p>

            <p>While the other series in the Duderstadt Digital Documents subgroup contain records which cover a variety of topics, the Strategy series (84 files, 1986-1996) is largely focused on issues specifically related to President Duderstadt's vision of higher education in the 21st century. The framework for his position of the future of education can be found in two key documents: "Vision 2000: The Leaders and Best" and "Vision 2017: Transforming the University."</p>
            <p>Duderstadt's espousal of the changing environment and the need for traditional institutions to transform is captured in this series. A researcher interested in his views on organizational change should look at the files containing the word transformation or variants with "trans" such as, "Transformation Text 1.6," "Trans Team 2.0," and "Trans Course 2.1." For a summary of Duderstadt's major strategic initiatives, priorities for the coming decade, and views of changes needed in education, research, and diversity consult the file "The Decade Report." This report outlines major initiatives introduced to the university by Duderstadt such as the Institute for the Humanities, the Media Union, Institute of Molecular Medicine, and the Tauber Manufacturing Institute. The digital file titled "Accomplishments," written in the fall of 1995, provides a very informative outline of Duderstadt's priorities for the decade, accomplishments, projects (listed by year), strategic plan (Phases I, II, III), major papers, and selected speeches (listed by year). Lastly, this series contains in the 1996-1997 Strategy subseries the records related to Duderstadt's vision of "The New University" and "The Millennium Project."</p>

            <p>The Position Papers series (140 digital files, 1986-1997) contains Duderstadt's key addresses, white papers, planning documents, annual reports, and presidential essays. Major papers contained in this series include: "The Michigan Mandate: A Strategic Linking of Academic Excellence and Social Diversity," "The Role of the Research University in Undergraduate Education," "Michigan's Challenge: Preparing for an Age of Knowledge," "The Michigan Agenda for Women: Toward a Full and Equal Partnership," "Intellectual Transformation." A complete list of major position papers can be found in the digital file titled "Accomplishments" located in the Strategy series. Researchers will note that several versions of a document are in the Digital Documents subgroup, and that Duderstadt used a numbering scheme to organize versions of an digital document. One example of his file naming scheme is a series of files from the 1991-1996 subseries entitled "Women 3.2," "Women 3.3," "Women 3.4."</p>

            <p>The majority of records in the Presentations series (64 digital files, 1987-1996) were created using the software application PowerPoint by Microsoft. This application was designed specifically as a presentation tool. Many of the records in this series seem to be presentations given to Duderstadt's Executive Officers (EOs) and the Regents at retreat meetings (for example, "Regents Retreat," "Tuition Retreat," "Leadership Retreat"). Other presentation topics included in this series are The Michigan Mandate, The Mission Plan, and University Resources.</p>
            <p>Researchers will note that in the Digital Documents subgroup contextual and descriptive information such as audience, location, and exact date of the presentation or speech is not always explicit in the digital record.</p>

            <p>The Write Files series (588 digital files, 1987-1997) is composed entirely of Microsoft Word text files. Researchers will find a variety of "traditional" business formats such as correspondence, agendas, and memorandums contained within the Write Files series. However, note that there is often an absence of descriptive information, such as the receiver's name and address, date, and signature line. The absence of this information is a reflection of the distributive work process practiced in President Duderstadt's office--a process afforded by networked computer technology. The correspondence includes letters of recommendation, thank-you's, and communication to persons not only at the University of Michigan but to persons throughout the country including U.S. presidents Gerald Ford and George Bush and Michigan governors James Blanchard and John Engler. It is important to note that Duderstadt often used the recipient's name or initials to name the file. For example, "Blanchard-1/89" and "H &amp; V-11/10" are communications to Governor James Blanchard in January 1989 and Harold and Vivian Shapiro on November 10th respectively.</p>
