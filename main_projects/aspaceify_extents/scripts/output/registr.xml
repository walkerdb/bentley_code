    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>In 1846, the faculty authorized the position of secretary of the faculty of the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts. The secretary was to create a permanent written record of faculty proceedings and to keep student records. The earliest use of the word "registrar" in a title occurred in 1863 when student record keeping was separated from the secretary's position. Edward P. Evans, professor of modern languages, was the first to be elected to this one-year position. According to The University of Michigan Encyclopedic Survey edited by Wilfred Shaw (Ann Arbor: University Press, 1942), student discipline problems caused the registrar's position to be abolished between 1872 and 1888. During this time the secretary of the faculty resumed the duties of the registrar.</p>
      <p>In 1875, Paul R. B. de Pont, instructor in French, was elected secretary of the faculty. He served as secretary until 1888 when the regents appointed him registrar of the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts.</p>
      <p>In 1878/79, a four-year program called the "English Course" was added to the curriculum. It was at this time that the credit system was substituted for a set schedule of four prescribed years of study. Additionally, the number of required courses in the programs were reduced to allow for electives.</p>
      <p>In 1882, the "University System" was introduced as an option in the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts. The University System did not require a student to complete a fixed number of required courses, but rather, allowed the student, under the direction of a faculty committee, to focus his studies. Upon the completion of four years and a satisfactory written examination, a bachelor of arts degree was conferred. "A master of arts degree was granted to the writer of a brilliant examination and a meritorious thesis." (The University of Michigan Encyclopedic Survey) The University System program led to both undergraduate and higher degrees; there was not yet a separate graduate school. Consequently, the University System and the work for advanced degrees became inextricably bound together. Records of the students of the University System were kept by faculty committees, separate from "regular" students.</p>
      <p>The Board of Regents authorized a plan in 1871 to admit graduates of accredited high schools by diploma. Michigan high schools were visited by a university faculty committee that appraised the schools for their work in science, philosophy, and the arts. A school had to pass the university's criteria in all three of the above areas to become accredited. Accreditation specifications were changed in 1876 to accommodate schools strong in only one or two of the subject areas. This new partial accreditation system allowed students entrance to select university programs depending on the accreditation status of the secondary school from where they graduated. The Department of Literature, Science and the Arts maintained four separate sets of entrance requirements throughout the 1890s. Admission by diploma was extended to high schools outside of Michigan in 1884. In May of 1900, a single system of entrance requirements went into effect. School visits were taken over by the Bureau of Co-operation with Educational Institutions in 1932.</p>
      <p>Incoming students in the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts took their credentials directly to the dean, rather than the president, as of the 1895/96 school year. Checking of admission credits was a task divided between the dean and the registrar, with the registrar administering the admissions of freshmen who had the customary preparation, and those with a very small amount of advanced credit or with extra high school credit. Besides reviewing freshman admissions, the registrar's responsibilities included interviewing students and acting as an intermediary between students and faculty in all matters involving study loads and student records.</p>
      <p>Registration for the professional academic units of pharmacy, engineering, and the School of Graduate Studies was originally under literary faculty control. The pharmacy admission records were under the auspices of the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts registrar until approximately 1875, the Department of Engineering until 1903, and the School of Graduate Studies until 1912.</p>
      <p>In 1907, at the time of the appointment of Dean John O. Reed, administrative work by the president was almost entirely relinquished. Administrative affairs of the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts were put into the hands of its own officers, the dean, and the registrar. A new title, University Registrar, was created in July 1915. It was at this time that the Office of the Registrar became an office of the university's central administration, completely independent of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. (It was also in 1915 that the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts was renamed College of Literature, Science and the Arts.) In May 1925, regental by-laws made the Office of the Registrar directly responsible to the regents through the president. The office became more specialized in 1929 with the creation of four divisions: Admissions, Records, Statistics, and Editorial. In 1949 the Office of the Director of Admissions, a separate administrative unit, was created due to the increase in the number of admissions after World</p>
      <p>War II. In 1954 the name of the Office of the Registrar was changed to the Office of Registration and Records. At the same time, the responsibility of orientation of new students was added to this office. The Time Schedule (course catalog) responsibilities were added to the office during the 1963/64 academic school year. Orientation and Scheduling were made independent units in 1967.</p>
      <p>During the winter term of 1972, the concept of Computer Registration Involving Student Participation (CRISP) grew out of a class project in a computer class taught by Professor Bernard E. Galler. CRISP was instituted in 1975 as an on-line registration program.</p>
      <p>Touch-tone CRISP was first introduced in November 1994. Beginning in March 1995, it was the mandatory form of registration for most students. In addition to helping students with registration needs, other CRISP services include transcripts requests, certification for loans and placement, academic record information, class schedules, term grade reports, and student directory changes.</p>
      <p>Wolverine Access, developed by the registrar's office in the summer of 1994, is an on-line service that enables students to access current student data. Students can access their own grades, class schedule, and academic report. They can also check on availability of classes and look at their account statement. This service was first made available through a client server with Macintosh machines at campus computing sites. Wolverine Access is now available on the World Wide Web.</p>

          <p>The Admissions series (8 linear feet) consists of admission records and applications for advanced standing. An admission form was generated for each student that applied to the university. The forms most relevant for genealogical research are those dated 1856-1871, as they include parent's name, home address and occasionally the age of the student. The application for advanced standing indicates the institutions previously attended by the student. The researcher should note that there are related outsize volumes described at the end of the finding aid.</p>

          <p>The Faculty Reports, Petitions and Resolutions series (5.5 linear feet) documents the work and decision making powers of the Faculty of the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A) as they acted on student petitions, academic standing, and other matters relating to admissions. This series contains a wealth of information relating to high school accreditation and its relationship to UM admissions. The records were originally bundled in envelopes by academic year, with a contents listing of items on the outside of each envelope. This list of items has been retained and placed in the appropriate folder for easier access to the contents. The records for any academic year are divided into four folders: General, Candidates for Degrees, Committee on Substitutions, and School Visits.</p>
          <p>The General category contains petitions, curricula changes, and issues that were voted on by the faculty. The Candidates for Degrees records are comprised of one-page documents outlining the academic history of the student as well as any future academic plans. The Committee on Substitutions records consist of letters written by students asking for substitutions of required courses. Of particular interest are the School Visits records documenting accreditation of secondary schools. The school visit reports include a listing of teachers and the subject they taught, as well as an evaluation of their performance. Also included in the report is the student population size, number of books in the library, and areas within the school needing improvement. Further information on these visits are located in the "University of Michigan. Bureau of School Services" record group.</p>

          <p>The Faculty Card Files series (1.5 linear feet) is comprised of an alphabetical run of 3" x 5" cards. Each card represents a faculty member, with information on academic education, courses taught, sabbaticals, and retirement date. It is unclear when the cards were first created, perhaps around 1930, however there are entries dating back to 1926. It appears that no cards were created after 1942.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files, 1924-1994 series (3 linear feet) was received as part of the 1994 accession. The bulk of the material, dating from 1959-1993, contains documentation on the registration process when it was facilitated through an IBM mainframe. Additionally, there is information on the Computer Registration Involving Student Participation (CRISP). The files contain information on the registration process, types of forms used, guidelines followed, and reports. There are scattered files from 1924-1958 on topics such as: Analysis of Grade Point Average, Freshman Grade Pint Averages, and Veterans.</p>

          <p>The Academic Record Project (ARP) series (5 linear feet) documents the computerization of the academic record. The records, compiled by Patricia V. Lehman, a member of various project committees, include information on the Planning Committee for Computerization of the Academic Record (PCCAR), the Student Characteristics Data Base (SCDB), the Michigan Audit Reporting System (MARS), and the Admissions System Production Group Committee (ASP).</p>
          <p>The Academic Record Project, which began in 1987, was designed to minimize the duplication of work by record keepers and to maximize accessibility of student record information by way of a cooperatively maintained electronic resource between the Office of the Registrar and the schools and colleges. The SCDB is an assemblage of hierarchical databases, flat files and hard copy that comprised the student information data resources. It was the SCDB Task Team that devised a plan to: determine the functional requirements of the fully computerized academic record; add data elements in appropriate logical segments to the SCDB to serve the functional requirements revealed by the investigation; and develop transactions, screens, and reporting capabilities needed to deliver the required services.</p>

          <p>The Reports and Statistics, 1840-2003 series (1 linear foot) is comprised of statistics and reports generated by the University of Michigan Office of the Registrar during the years 1840 to 2003, with the bulk years being 1960 to 1980. The statistics, some of which were produced for publications and others for office use only, yield and analyze data on the student population. The data is organized into various reference points including: academic term, gender, nationality, geographic area, class level, grade point average, and academic unit. The series is divided into two subseries; Enrollment Statistics, which focuses on student body data, and Grade Point Average, which analyzes average grades of the student population.</p>
