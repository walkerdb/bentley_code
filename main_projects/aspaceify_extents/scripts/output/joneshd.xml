    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Henry David Jones was born May 10, 1900 in Chicago, Illinois. In 1918, he enrolled in Ripon College under the auspices of the Student Army Training Corps. Following his graduation in 1923, he entered McCormick Theological Seminary. While studying in seminary he was director of boy's work at Howell House, a mission outreach to the foreign-born living on the southwest side of Chicago. He received his ordination in 1926, and was appointed director of the Gary, Indiana Neighborhood House. It was while working in Gary that he met and married Maurine Fink, his companion for the next 58 years.</p>
      <p>In 1930, the couple was called to New York by the Presbyterian Board of National Missions to work for the office of City, Immigrant, and Industrial Work. From New York they were called to direct the Dodge Neighborhood House in Detroit, Michigan. They arrived in the midst of the depression and the struggle to organize the United Automobile Workers. It was during their stay in Detroit that their two children David and Sandra were born.</p>
      <p>After thirteen years in Detroit, the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions invited the Jones family to China in 1947. Working with the Church of Christ in China Henry became a pioneer in the field of industrial mission. As the communists rose to power Jones sent his wife and two children home in 1948. He remained in China until 1950.</p>
      <p>Back in the United States, Reverend Jones served pastorates in the Dubuque, Iowa Presbytery between 1950 and 1953. In late 1953, Jones was recalled to the mission field. Originally assigned to India, visa complications caused him to go to Japan instead. It was during this time in Japan that the first Asian Conference on Industrial Evangelism was held in Manila. The conference included representatives from sixteen Asian countries.</p>
      <p>Jones's first stint in Japan ended in 1957. While awaiting recall he served as a worldwide traveling consultant before returning to Japan in 1962. After three years the Joneses retired from foreign mission. During his "retirement" Jones served as interim pastor in nine different Michigan churches. In 1985 he made his retirement official at the age of 85.</p>
      <p>In their later years, the Joneses maintained contact with many Asian acquaintances, even returning to China to visit in 1979. They were also instrumental in bringing several students from Asia to study in the United States. In 1981 Henry Jones was honored with the G.R.A.C.E. (Grand Rapids Area Center For Ecumenism) award. McCormick Seminary similarly honored him in 1985, for his lifetime commitment to mission.</p>
      <p>In addition to his years of devoted service to his Church, the Rev. Jones was also interested in the experiences of the Welsh in America. He was particularly concerned with the history of Welsh churches and religious song festivals in Michigan.</p>
