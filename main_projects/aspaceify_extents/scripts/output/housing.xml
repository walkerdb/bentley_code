    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The University of Michigan's role in providing housing for students has varied dramatically through time. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the university took very minimal responsibility for student housing. Around the turn of the century, however, the dean of women began to show interest in the subject. After years of effort, the university's first official residence for women, Helen Newberry Residence, was opened in 1915, followed by Martha Cook (1915), Alumnae House (1917), Betsey Barbour House (1920) and Adelia Cheever House (1921). A crowded housing market led to the construction of additional women's dormitories in the 1930s, including Mosher-Jordan (1930) and Stockwell (1940).</p>
      <p>While after World War I the university accepted much responsibility for the housing of women, housing men was a more controversial subject. In 1920 a Housing Bureau for Men was established, and that office established as a goal the creation of sufficient dormitory space to house all incoming freshmen, both male and female. Debate over the topic continued, however, and in 1922 a group of alumni acted by opening Fletcher Hall as a residence for male students. In 1933 Fletcher Hall was acquired by the university, and in the late 1930s, with the construction of West and East Quads, the university accepted responsibility for providing housing for both male and female students.</p>
      <p>The means to finance and administer an extensive housing plant have evolved over time. Originally dormitories were required to be financially self-supporting entities directly operated under the regents. The Depression made this arrangement untenable. The university pioneered a new financial and administrative structure in 1931 with the construction of Mosher-Jordan. The dormitory was paid for through a self-liquidating bond and control of the dormitory's finances and other matters was vested in a Board of Governors. This operational pattern was expanded in 1933, when all the women's residences except Martha Cook (the deed of gift for which guaranteed its independence) were consolidated into a single financial entity.</p>
      <p>The post World War II expansion of the university put a tremendous strain on housing. The university responded with the construction of several new facilities. Alice Lloyd Hall (1949), South Quad (1951), Geddes House (1953), Oxford Housing (1963), and Bursley Hall (1968), helped cope with undergraduate students, Baits Housing (originally identified as Cedar Bend) (1966) was designed for upper classmen and graduate students.</p>
      <p>At this time, there was a large number of married armed forces veterans enrolling at the university, creating a need for married housing. Being fully committed to meeting the educational needs of the veterans, the university initiated married student housing through the building of University Terrace in 1947 and the Northwood units in 1955, 1957, and 1958. Due to continued enrollment of the older, married student and the continuation of the GI bill, additional Northwood units were built in 1968 and 1972.</p>
      <p>In 1962, the Reed committee, a committee to study student affairs at the university, called for continued commitment to quality housing but urged a phasing out of the "in loco parentis" role of the university. It was at this time, with the restructuring of the Office of Student Affairs, that housing became the responsibility of a single director in the Housing Division under the Vice President for Student Services, rather than the responsibility of the Dean of Men and the Dean of Women. The business, housekeeping, maintenance, and food service operations remained the responsibility of Financial Operations. In 1965, family housing was integrated into the Housing Division.</p>
      <p>On July 1, 1966, the Office of University Housing was created, with John Feldkamp as director. The new office combined the responsibilities of Housing Division with those of Financial Operations. The Office of University Housing was then responsible for all aspects of university owned and affiliated housing. Relationships with the private market (off-campus housing) were maintained by the Office of Student Community relations.</p>
      <p>In 1972, the Off-Campus Housing Office of the Housing Division was created as a result of the report of the Commission on Off-Campus Housing, created under President Harlan Hatcher in 1965. The commission's report urged the university to concern itself with the housing needs of all students, not just those in university owned and operated housing. The Off-Campus Housing Office acted as an informational agency: informing students on the availability of off-campus housing, advising on landlord-tenant concerns, and assuming responsibility for providing input to the university community regarding the off campus-student housing situation.</p>
      <p>The 1937 Michigan House Plan was the ultimate factor in determining the objectives of housing at the university. The plan suggested that Housing should in some way contribute to student education, in addition to providing rooms. This was first implemented by naming residence units in honor of past faculty and by the opening of residence hall libraries. The goals of housing have continued to focus on education, student services, administrative and staff development. In the 1970s, educational needs continued to be addressed through residence education programs, residential academic programs, and residence hall libraries.</p>
      <p>The Residence Hall Academic Peer Advisor Program was developed as a cooperative effort between Housing Division and the Academic Advising Office of the undergraduate College of Literature, Science and the Arts. The intent of the program was to meet criteria set by University Housing policy: academic interests of the residents must be served by programs and services offered in each residence hall. The first program was established at Markley Hall for the 1990/91 academic year. By 1996/97 the program expanded to a total of nine residence units.</p>
      <p>Residence Halls Computing Program (ResComp) is a joint venture of the Information Technology Division and University Housing that started as a pilot project in the Mosher Jordan dormitories during the 1986/87 academic year. By May of 1986 approximately 150 Macintosh computers had been installed in eleven residence hall sites. ResComp student staff (trainers) lived in nine of the residence halls and taught classes on word processing and Michigan Terminal System (MTS) for approximately 10 hours per week. In 1991, ResComp sites were changed to 24 hour card access. Currently residence halls have in-room ethernet connectivity in addition to the computer centers.</p>
      <p>Other areas implemented by Housing Division include Housing Food Service, Conference Management Services and the Entree and Entree Plus programs.</p>

            <p>The initial accessions of material from the Housing Office covered the years 1920-1978. They were received in many discreet accessions. In a major reprocessing of the records in 1986, the numerous accessions were arbitrarily arranged into a single alphabetical Central Topical Files series. Not surprisingly the topic most thoroughly documented in the Central Topical Files is student life within the university dormitory system. There is also much information about dormitory construction and governance. The latter topic covers a wide variety of social customs, but is particularly complete regarding the gradual lifting of special regulations affecting women and the gradual disappearance of gender specified dormitories. Four other topics are covered at some depth. Scattered throughout the records is information regarding race relations within the dormitories and the community. Second, there is a quantity of information regarding fraternities and sororities. Information includes consideration of the organizations' decline in the 1960s (and the subsequent impact on student housing that a loss of fraternity and sorority rooms would entail) and the proposed construction of fraternity and sorority houses on North Campus. Third, there is a large amount of information regarding the construction of Inter-Cooperative Council Sponsored housing on North Campus. Fourth, and more surprisingly, is a large body of personnel records relating to Japanese-Americans employed by the University during World War II. Many came to the university from Relocation Centers, and there is a small body of correspondence with individuals at these Centers.</p>

            <p>The Central Topical Files, 1940-1993 subseries (1.25 linear feet) is arranged alphabetically. The records appear to be from the Off-Campus Housing Office of the Housing Division. Off-Campus housing refers to housing in the university community that is not owned and operated by the University of Michigan. Included in this category are apartments, rental houses, and small group housing. Small group housing refers to fraternities, sororities, and student owned and operated cooperatives, of which the university has more interaction. The researcher interested individual small group housing units should look at the Small Group Housing series, immediately following.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the files deal with off-campus housing, however, there are some files relating to residence halls. Within the "Off-Campus Housing" files, the researcher will find information on the Off-Campus Housing Registration Program, inspection reports of off-campus rental units, leases for fraternities and sororities and Inter-Cooperative materials. The Off-Campus Housing Registration program was designed by the Housing Information Office to identify those rental property owners or managers who wished to rent to students in a program of cooperation with the university. To become registered, rental units had to be certified by the city, agree to use the rental lease agreement or an approved private lease, comply with non-discriminating standards and agree to use the University of Michigan Mediation Service to resolve tenant-landlord disputes. The "Registered Buildings" folder contains a list from 1989 of registered landlords and the number of units they rented.</p>
            <p>The "Inter-Cooperative Council" files contain historical materials, housing inspection reports, and membership contracts. Of particular interest in the "Residence Hall-Rates" file is a list of residence hall rates spanning the years 1940/41 through 1992/93.</p>

            <p>The Central Topical Files 1933-1992 series (5.5 linear feet) is arranged in alphabetical order and documents the Housing Office in its broadest sense; the files span the years 1933-1992. The "Goals/purpose" file provides good insight into the core functions of the office. There is good documentation on the Rate Study Committee through annual reports and yearly files. Reports (1940-1979) have been grouped under the heading "Reports" to facilitate easier identification. Report topics include international students at the university, freshman women's hours, experimental living units, and residence halls. Documentation on residence halls includes educational philosophy, historical building data, and an analysis of the students living in the dormitories.</p>

            <p>The Central Topical Files, 1942-1994 subseries (1.5 linear feet) (formerly called the Director of Housing files) appears to be a continuation of the Central Topical Files series. Of particular interest is the "Michigan House Plan" file, as it contains not only a copy of the plan, but background of and reaction to, the plan. The files came from the office of Robert C. Hughes, Director of Housing from 1966-1977.</p>

            <p>The Central Topical Files series is largely composed of the files of housing directors John Feldkamp and Robert Hughes. The files are arranged alphabetically and document the Housing Divisions broad challenges in administering the residence halls, family housing, and Greek housing; challenges include: security, safety, and food quality. Of interest are the records of South Quad Residence Hall which contain a photo album, newspaper clippings and profiles of resident hall advisors. The problems that housing officials have had in enforcing their drug and alcohol policy in residence halls are well documented in six folders contained in this series.</p>

            <p>The Greek Housing series is comprised of individual fraternity and sorority house files for the years 1971-1989 (bulk years are 1974-1988). The files vary in depth and breadth, but most contain Off-Campus Housing registration forms, chapter surveys, and inspection reports. Other documents that the researcher might find useful within the files include: member lists, violation letters, house rules, rental agreements, and colony (pre-chapter status) evaluation forms. The chapter surveys indicate the name of the president and steward, capacity of the house, number of pledges, and the alumni advisor. The registration forms contain the address of the house, president, numbers and size of sleeping rooms, in addition to the rental rate for the rooms. The inspection reports include information documenting the physical structure of the house. The reports will note previous or upcoming renovations, existing features and general code infractions.</p>

          <p>The Small Group Housing series (2.75 linear feet) is divided into two sub-series: Cooperative Housing, and Miscellaneous Housing. The Cooperative Housing sub-series contains files on cooperatives for the mid to late 1970s. The files are similar to those for Greek housing in that they contain small group housing questionnaires and housing inspection reports.</p>

          <p>The Residence Halls series (4 linear feet) spans the years 1940-1989. The series is arranged in alphabetical order, by the first name of the building (i.e. Adelia Cheever is listed under "a") in order to maintain the original order of the filing system. The term "SEE" is used to let the researcher know that the materials are located under a different heading while "See Also" indicates an additional place to look for information. The files of the Pilot program are located within the files of the Alice Lloyd dormitory and the files of the Residential College are located within the East Quad files.</p>
          <p>The series provides a good source for what day-to-day life was like in the dorm. Monthly reports are a good source for locating events that took place as well as policies that were instituted or changed. The files of most living units contain information on the individual that the house or dorm was named after.</p>
          <p>The researcher interested in a specific dorm should also look at the UM Housing Division printed collection, as the dorm booklets are very rich in information on dormitory history, policies, and opportunities.</p>

            <p>The Videos are arranged in chronological order and are primarily Residence Hall Repertory Theater Productions. The presentations include two or three short skits that deal with issues such as date rape, racial discrimination, and stereotypes Most productions incorporate audience participation. For a good introduction to the purpose and format of the presentations, the researcher should view the April 1990 "Talk to Us" video, as it is a promotional video for the series.</p>

          <p>The Microfilm series (2 reels) was filmed by the Housing Division. The first reel probably has the most general appeal, as it is comprised of newspaper clippings from 1979-1990 that relate to Housing. The second reel contains surveys, monthly reports, residence hall library reports, and the 1976 Housing procedures manual. (Negative use copies only) [Bimu/B6/micro]</p>

          <p>The Program Director Files (2.0 linear feet) are arranged alphabetically and appear to be created by Ed Salowitz and Peter Ostafin. File headings have been named to be as consistent as possible with the previous accessions.</p>
          <p>Items of particular interest are the "Historical Background Files" and the "Reports." The "Historical Background Files" contain considerable information on the evolution of residential housing, male and female. The "Dormitory Histories" file contains fact sheets on each of the dormitories. The fact sheet contains information on the individual that the dormitory was named in honor of, cost and description of the building, date of completion, information on the houses within the dorm, and any special programs within the unit. Reports and surveys have been combined under the heading "Reports." The reports, which span the years 1925 through 1990, include such topics as living conditions for students, graduate student housing, and studying in residence halls. Many of the files within this series fill the gaps that are found in previous accessions.</p>
