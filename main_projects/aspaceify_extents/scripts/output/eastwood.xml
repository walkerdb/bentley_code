      <p>The Eastwood Church of God was founded in 1937. The first service was held on February 7 at the YMCA in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The Church then moved to a rented storefront under the name of the Lovett Street Church of God a few weeks later. Reverend John Batdorf served as the first pastor. The first set of bylaws was adopted at a special congregational meeting on May 26, 1938.</p>
      <p>In 1941, the congregation started meeting at the Faith Memorial Church with Rev. Batdorf serving as the main minister and the congregation of Faith Memorial providing the building. After sixteen months the congregation decided to rent space again, this time at the Eastside Community House.</p>
      <p>1945 was an important year for Eastwood's congregation. The Reverend Weldon Lane became pastor of Eastwood and a building committee was elected. The building committee initiated the first Christmas dinner to raise money for the building fund. The Christmas dinner has become an important tradition with the congregation ever since. With funds from the Christmas dinner and other sources the congregation was able to purchase a house on 2929 East Main Street at Sunnyside Drive in Kalamazoo. The house was used for worship until a sanctuary was built. The sanctuary at the new property was dedicated in November 1946 and served as the congregation's home until 1991.</p>
      <p>On August 22, 1948, Reverend B. Gale Hetrich and Bessie Hetrick assumed the pastorate at Eastwood. "Accents," the church newsletter was first published on March 26, 1950. Also in 1950 the church was able to provide a parsonage at 1233 Upland Dr.</p>
      <p>Reverend Maurice Mauch became the third pastor at Eastwood in June 1956. In 1960, ground was broken for a major expansion of the church. The new sanctuary, dedicated April 9, 1961, seats 350 and also included modern teaching facilities able to accommodate 450 students.</p>
      <p>In 1964 Reverend Harold Minkler assumed pastoral duties at Eastwood. During Reverend Minkler's tenure the congregation expanded with 180 individuals attending services regularly in 1969, the largest attendance in Eastwood's history. Since its first days music has played an integral part of Eastwood's religious life. An adult and children's choir has existed since the early years of the church. In the 1960s, church musical programs expanded with for example a youth choir created in 1964, the dedication of a new organ in the same year, and the presentation of the first octave of hand bells in 1965. Eastwood has added more hand bells to its musical program and it has become an important component in worship and concert.</p>
      <p>The pastorate was undertaken by Reverend L. Spencer Spaulding in 1976. In 1978 Eastwood elected its first associate pastor, San Germany. The new pastor's responsibilities were music (choir director) and community outreach. In 1979, Dick Forsman was designated the first associate minister of youth.</p>
      <p>Reverend Brian Hansen began pastoral duties in 1980. In 1984, a remodeling created two new Sunday school classrooms and a youth meeting space. Another remodeling in 1987 created new office facilities and a small fellowship hall. The sanctuary library and narthex were also renovated.</p>
      <p>Eastwood Church of God has always been involved in the support of missionaries. The Ladies Missionary Society was founded in 1937. In 1972, the society disbanded and a mission outreach committee was formed. In 1964, Eastwood joined the Living Link program in support of Church of God missions. During the 1980s, many members of the congregation participated in work camps in Guyana and the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Reverend John Henbruch, who took over pastoral duties in 1987, has had the responsibility of leading a church in flux. By 1987, regular attendance had decreased from a high of 180 to an average of 80 people on Sunday mornings. A special association meeting was called on April 9, 1989. The issue was to decide what direction the church should take in the future. Eastwood was feeling the pressure of a changing neighborhood. The outcome of the meeting was to focus targeting efforts on new members from the suburbs, which might necessitate changing the location of the worship center. The Eastwood Church of God sold its property in 1991, and moved to a rented building in a suburban location.</p>

          <p>The General Files, arranged alphabetically by topic, contain the bulk of the records (2 linear feet). The files document the daily operations of Eastwood from 1937 to 1989. An incomplete run of "Accents," the Church newsletter, dates from 1965 to 1980. The majority of material in this series was generated by the various committees of Eastwood. The earliest committee minutes, kept together in a binder, are in the file titled "Minutes" located in box 2. The Advisory Council minutes cover the years 1941-1989 and detail the operation of Eastwood. "Annual Reports" (1939-1989) contain the previous year's budget and the proposed budget for the coming year. After 1956, the annual reports also contain yearly reports from many of the committees.</p>
          <p>The "Historical Materials" file within the General Files contains two church histories written for the congregation, covering the years 1937-1973 and 1937-1987 respectively. The "Historical Clippings" file includes various newspaper clippings concerning Eastwood. "Photographs" consists of labeled pictures of church members, pastors, and the sanctuary.</p>
