      <p>William Gould Dow was a member of the faculty of the University of Michigan Department of Electrical Engineering from 1926 to 1964. He served as chairman of the department from 1958 until 1964. While at the University of Michigan, Dow was instrumental in establishing the University's Willow Run Research Laboratories and initiated several research programs in the Electrical Engineering Department, including the Plasma Engineering Laboratory and the Space Physics Research Laboratory. He helped found the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM), and served on its board of directors until 1990. He was extremely active as a member of several professional societies, including the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and the Institute of Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineers (IEEE). In addition to his teaching and administrative activities, Dow conducted significant basic and applied research in the areas of high-frequency power welding, vacuum tube development, gas discharge plasma, microwave electron tubes, use of rockets and satellites in investigations of the upper atmosphere, missile guidance systems, and military electronics.</p>
      <p>Dow was born September 30, 1895 in Faribault, Minnesota. He received a BS degree from the University of Minnesota in 1916 and an electrical engineering degree in 1917. Between 1917 and 1926 Dow was employed with Westinghouse Electric Company, working in sales and product testing. Dow joined the University of Michigan's Electrical Engineering Department in 1926 as an instructor in electronics. He received his M.S.E. in 1929, and was made an assistant professor. Dow was promoted to associate professor in 1938 and to full professor in 1945. He served as chairman of the department from 1958 until 1964. In 1965 Dow retired, continuing to hold an appointment as professor emeritus until 1997.</p>
      <p>From 1943 to 1945, Dow was on leave at the Radio Research Laboratory, Harvard University, conducting war-related research for the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development. He directed research in high-frequency radio transmission as a radar countermeasure. In that capacity, Dow spent three months in 1944-1945 in Britain, overseeing installation of radar jamming equipment and surveying British vacuum tube research laboratories for the Vacuum Tube Development Committee of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), of which he was a member.</p>
      <p>During and after the war, Dow was involved in many industry and government-sponsored projects. Among the major projects were an investigation of a sheet metal welding technique for the Fisher Body Division of General Motors; consulting for the National Bureau of Standards (1945-1955) on problems relating to vacuum tubes; a variety of projects for the Signal Corps, Air Force, and Army Ordnance relating to microwave electron tubes, particularly magnetrons; and a number of investigations of management and personnel issues at military installations and research laboratories.</p>
      <p>Dow served on the prestigious Rocket and Satellite Research Panel from 1946 until 1960; this group coordinated all military-supported programs toward determining the properties of the upper atmosphere. He was also a member of the Technical Panel on Rocketry of the International Geophysical Year (1956-1959). He was a member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), and other professional organizations. In addition to numerous technical articles, Dow published Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering, for many years a standard textbook in the field.</p>
      <p>Dow held an appointment as Senior Research Geophysicist at the Space Physics Research Lab from 1966-1971. He was a charter member of the Board of Directors of the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, serving on the board from 1972 until 1990, and as a trustee emeritus until 1997. Later in life he worked on efforts to produce thermonuclear fusion, for which he received two patents in the 1980s. Dow continued to live in Ann Arbor until 1997, when he moved to Waco, Texas and Bellevue, Washington.</p>

      <p>The William G. Dow Papers document his career as a faculty member of the University of Michigan Department of Electrical Engineering, his scientific research, his participation in professional organizations, and his other professional interests and activities. The collection also contains copies of published and unpublished technical and professional papers written by Dow, and two unpublished books. The papers include lecture notes taken by Dow, texts of lectures given by Dow and others, course materials used in Dow's classes, correspondence, minutes, reports, raw data, photographs, and other material relating to Dow's research. The papers are composed of six series: University of Michigan Activities, Research, Professional Organizations, Articles, Books and Talks, Topical Files, Correspondence, and Photographs. There is a great deal of overlap between theses series, as Dow was often engaged in educational, research, publishing, and professional activities simultaneously. Researchers are advised to consult the entire collection. A small group of biographical and bibliographical materials begins the collection.</p>

          <p>In the University of Michigan Activities series, the largest subseries (Lecture Notes and Course Materials) contains materials relating to Dow's experiences both as a teacher and a student of electrical engineering. Materials in this subseries are divided into two sub-subseries: materials created by Dow and those relating to courses taught by others. Courses Dow taught are organized by course number, and these folders contain his notes, exercises, tests, and exams given to students. In many cases there seems to be an overlap between Dow's work as a teacher and his activities conducting industrial and government research, as demonstrated by the many pieces of correspondence with corporations which Dow indicated should be included in these files. Of particular interest may be the materials relating to the basic course in electronics developed by Dow which was required of all undergraduate students in electrical engineering at Michigan since 1929. According to The University of Michigan: An Encyclopedic Survey: "the College of Engineering of the University of Michigan was one of the first engineering schools in the United States to include instruction in electronics as a major item in its curriculum." (III, 1230) The extensive documentation of the courses Dow taught, together with his correspondence about education and the curriculum, may be of interest to those studying the evolution of this innovative program. Courses taught by people other than Dow are organized alphabetically by the professor's last name; these folders contain lecture notes rather than course materials.</p>
          <p>This series also includes the University of Michigan Research Centers subseries which contains materials relating to the founding and administration of the Aeronautical Research Center and the Engineering Research Center. Another subseries relates to the Summer Electronics Institute, of which Dow was the director. The files of the Institute include correspondence relating to the planning of the institute, programs, notes on lectures taken by him, and texts of several lectures by Institute instructors. In 1937 the topic of the Summer Institute was high vacuum electron tubes and gaseous conduction principles; in 1950 the topics were microwave electron tubes and semi-conductor electronics, and in 1955 it focused on transistor applications. Materials relating to other activities sponsored by or held at the University of Michigan are included in the Events at the University of Michigan subseries.</p>

          <p>The Research series is composed of two subseries: Industrial Research and Government Research. The extent of documentation varies considerably among individual projects, but may include correspondence, reports, notes, photographs and experimental data, and budget information. Each subseries consists of separate files for the various sponsored projects involving Dow as a director or participant. The Industrial Research subseries begins with a general correspondence file; the remainder of the materials are arranged alphabetically by the name of the sponsoring company. Where a project number has been identified, it is included in the folder title. Among the more significant of these projects is Dow's work for the Fisher Body Division of General Motors on the use of high-frequency power for welding sheet metal (which resulted in several patents).</p>
          <p>The Government Research subseries begins with projects which could not be identified by a project number, listed alphabetically. The remainder of the folders in the subseries are organized by project number. The following materials are particularly significant: Project 669 which employed U-2 rockets in investigations of the ionosphere; Project 679, (or "Wizard") which involved development of guidance systems for an anti-ballistic missile, and Project M2144, (known as "Wolverine," and later "Project Michigan") which encompassed a wide range of military sponsored research.</p>

          <p>The Articles, Books and Talks series contains three subseries: Published materials, Unpublished materials, and Notebooks. The Published subseries consists almost entirely of articles, arranged in chronological order by their date of publication. In some cases, folders may also contain earlier drafts and correspondence relating to the article. Full bibliographic citations for these articles can be found in the bibliography included with the Biographical materials, but neither this bibliography nor the items in this subseries provide a complete list of Dow's publications. The Unpublished subseries contains draft copies of two books: <title render="italic">Ultra-High Frequency Space-Charge Control Tubes</title> (1957) and <title render="italic">Microwave Electron Beam Tubes</title> (1958). Memoranda, talks, and articles relating to education, research, and policy can also be found in this subseries. The notebooks subseries is arranged chronologically and items are identified by title or topic. The exact purpose of these materials is unclear--some appear to be drafts of articles, others appear related to scientific research or class preparation.</p>
