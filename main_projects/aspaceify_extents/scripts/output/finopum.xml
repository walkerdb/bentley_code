      <p>The financial records of the University have been maintained in a number of different offices. Prior to the Civil War, the Regents authorized two University officers to retain financial records, the Treasurer and the Regent's Secretary. While the lines of authority were indistinct, generally the Treasurer was responsible for the actual collection or disbursement of funds, while the Secretary kept duplicate but more detailed records of transactions which he used to carry out his informal responsibility to serve as auditor and business manager. This basic arrangement was maintained and proved adequate until the twentieth century.</p>
      <p>In 1908, however, the laxness of the accounting procedures became apparent when the state attorney general sharply criticized the University for maintaining at least one special petty cash fund which did not appear in the regular University financial records. The criticism, along with other issues, led to the resignation of the Secretary. In 1909 Shirley W. Smith was appointed Secretary to the Regents, and was given a mandate to overhaul the University's accounting procedures and policies.</p>
      <p>Smith concluded that proper financial control required the centralization of operations in one office, and began the slow process of making all University fiscal matters flow through either himself or his subordinates. A central purchasing office was created, and the care of the university's physical plant, a major item of expense, was centralized under the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. When the University began a massive construction program in 1921, it was determined that all financial transactions regarding the numerous projects were to be processed by the Secretary's office. By the late 1920's all University department accounting records flowed into the Secretary's office. Recognizing the increasing financial responsibilities that their Secretary bore, the Regents in 1927 changed Smith's title to Secretary and Business Manager.</p>
      <p>When Alexander Grant Ruthven was appointed University President in 1929, he was determined to reorganize the University's administration along the lines of a private corporation. As part of that reorganization, Smith in 1930 was named Vice-President and Secretary in charge of Business and Finance. Along with the new title, came a new and expanded mandate for Smith and his subordinates. The Treasurer's Office was abolished in 1931. Smith's office became responsible for accounting, purchasing, investments, cash management, buildings and grounds, construction, and services such as printing, stores and housing, all this in addition to the responsibilities incumbent upon the office as Secretary to the Regents.</p>
      <p>The day to day financial operations of the unit were controlled by John C. Christensen. Hired by Smith in 1914 with the title Assistant Secretary, Christensen became Controller and Assistant Secretary when Smith was made a Vice-President. Among his many responsibilities, Christensen oversaw four financial units: accounting, purchasing, cashier and investments. The accounting unit was led by the Chief Accountant.</p>
      <p>The retirements of Christensen in 1944 and Smith in 1945 led to a restructuring of the positions they had held. Robert P. Briggs, who succeeded Smith as Vice-President, was responsible only for the financial aspects of Smith's position. Herbert G. Watkins, who replaced Christensen, was made responsible for Smith's Secretarial duties and was given the title Secretary to the University. Technically, Watkins still reported to Briggs, but their responsibilities were both distinct and generally unrelated. This fact was recognized by the Regents in 1959 when the Secretary's office was reassigned to report directly to the University President, rather than through the Vice-President for Business and Finance.</p>
      <p>In response to the ever expanding volume of operations created by the University's post 1945 growth, the lines of authority running from the Vice-President for Business and Finance became increasingly distinct and departmentalized. The Controllers Office became responsible for overseeing several operations, including that of the Accounting Office. In 1966, a reorganization by the new University Controller, Howard Cottrell, moved the Payroll Office as a unit from under the Chief Accountant. In addition, the sponsored research grant and contract administration function moved into the Accounting Department from the Office of the Assistant Controller and Business Manager for Sponsored Research. The small staff remaining in that office became the Office of Contract Review reporting to an Assistant to the Controller. In 1966 the Vice-President for Business and Finance title was changed to Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. In subsequent years, the separate accounting systems for the Institute for Social Research, Food Stores, Law Club, and University Hospital were also incorporated into the central systems of the Accounting Department.</p>
      <p>During academic year 1980-1981 the Accounting Office's name was changed to Financial Operations. The Chief Accountant's title was changed to Director.</p>

      <p>The records of Financial Operations date from 1837 to 1982, primarily after 1910. The 27 linear feet of manuscript material, 52 oversized volumes and one reel of microfilm reflect not only the financial records normally associated with an accounting office, but also the broad range of subjects which became a concern under the leadership of Shirley Smith. What would eventually become Financial Operations may have served as a records storage office for many of the other units under Smith's control. In any event, Financial Operations became the guardian of a wide variety of records, documenting the University in a number of ways not normally expected of an accounting service.</p>
      <p>Of particular note, the collection contains a variety of different record formats. Bound materials, in the form of books, are included in the boxes and when numbering more than one, are listed in the finding aid as multiple volumes. The collection also contains oversized volumes, in the form of large accounting books. These oversized volumes are numbered and stored separately. They are listed in the finding aid where intellectually appropriate, and designated by volume number. Enclosed in this finding aid is an index of the oversized volumes, organized by number, and their contents.</p>
      <p>The collection is divided into six series: General University Financial Records; Trust Fund Records; Records of Land, Proposed Development and Construction; Operating Records of Buildings, Divisions and other Units; Miscellaneous Reports, Studies and Volumes; and Accounting Office Records.</p>

          <p>General University Financial Records, gives an overview of University funding and expenses. Included are the Secretary's journal of receipts and disbursements (1914-1949), various income records, and a number of verification and housekeeping records, including audits and inventories. Particularly interesting are a group of cash statements maintained throughout the Depression, apparently so that University officials could determine their ability to pay creditors.</p>

          <p>Records of Land, Proposed Development and Construction, contains records regarding property owned by the University, records regarding planned development of University property, and the actual construction of buildings for use by the University. Most significant is a series of Building Reports (1923-1930; 1936-1965) which documents in great detail the construction of every campus building erected during this period. In addition there is detailed information regarding many of these projects, particularly about the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, the Baird Carillon in the Burton Memorial Tower, the Power Plant operating expenses and several dormitories. The dormitory files include correspondence with Ralph Stone and other University regents.</p>

          <p>Operating Records of Buildings, Divisions and other Units, contains daily records regarding the functioning of a variety of University projects. A detailed list (1957-1964) of Departmental payrolls and accounts is available here. In addition, extensive dormitory records exist for most of the university-run housing facilities (ca. 1930-1965). The Board in Control of Athletics is represented (1932-1939), as well as the hospital (1925-1947), the Institute for Social Research (1946-1955), and miscellaneous student organizations (1932-1951). There is also detailed information regarding the operation of an exchange program between the University of Michigan and Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. The Waseda University project files, found under the name of the project's sponsoring agency, the International Cooperative Administration, include detailed evaluations of the program written by Japanese participants just prior to their departure from the United States.</p>
