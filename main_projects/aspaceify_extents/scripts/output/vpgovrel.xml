      <p>The Board of Regents in their January 1968 meeting approved the creation of the new position of Vice President for State Relations and Planning. This office was created as a response to the increasing costs of, as well as increasing demand for, higher education, in addition to keener competition for funds. The office was to serve as the focal point for the development of academic programs and capital plans within the university, and as an instrument for articulating these plans to the government of the state of Michigan. In addition, this office was to serve as the chief consultant to the President and all other vice presidents of the university on questions related to state government planning and relations. Previously, all of these functions had been carried out by a number of different units within the university.</p>
      <p>Arthur M. Ross, former Commissioner of Labor Statistics for the United States Department of Labor, was appointed Vice President for State Relations and Planning effective July 1, 1968. Ross passed away suddenly in June 1970, and Fedele F. Fauri, Dean of the School of Social Work, was appointed as his successor. Fauri served in this position until his retirement in September 1974, whereupon the office was reorganized under the leadership of Richard L. Kennedy, Secretary of the University. Kennedy held the dual title Vice President for State Relations and Secretary of the University.</p>
      <p>At the November 1984 Board of Regents meeting, the office's name was changed from Office of State Relations to the Office of Government Relations (the bylaws were formally amended in September 1985). Following Kennedy's retirement in 1994, the office was once again reorganized. The Secretary of the University functions handled by Kennedy were created as a separate office (Harold Johnson served as interim secretary prior to the appointment of Roberta Palmer). Walter Harrison, who had been appointed Vice President for University Relations, was given oversight of a unit that included associate vice presidents for government relations (community, state, and federal), Marketing and Communications, News and Information Services, and radio station WUOM.</p>
      <p>In January 1998 the Regents approved a recommendation to return functions of the Secretary of the University to the Vice President for University Relations. Shortly thereafter, in May 1998, Harrison accepted the presidency of the University of Hartford. After Harrison's departure, at the recommendation of President Bollinger, University Relations was divided into three vice presidential posts: Vice President for Government Relations, Vice President and Secretary, and Vice President for Media Relations. The last position eventually became Vice President for Communications and was staffed by Lisa Rudgers in April 2000.</p>
      <p>Cynthia Wilbanks was named Vice President for Government Relations in 1998. In January 2002 she was also asked to serve as interim Vice President for Development following the departure of Susan Feagin. The current arrangement of the office has a federal relations director, community relations director, Lansing service center director, and shared oversight for a state outreach director. Current information about this office is available on the Web at the following URL: <title render="italic">http://www.umich.edu/~govrel/</title></p>
      <p>The University of Michigan Washington Office was formally opened in January 1990. It was created to establish a permanent presence in Washington and function as an outreach base to Congress and the federal government in support of the university's teaching, research, and service.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The records of the Office of Vice President for Government Relations reflect the core functions of the office (local, state, and federal government relations and planning) and the various incarnations of the office, including the duties of Secretary of the University variously performed by the office. Documentation is primarily from the Ann Arbor campus office, but also includes files on the federal relations office operated by the university in Washington, D.C. Files received directly from the state relations office in Lansing are not included here. Materials detail the budget and appropriations process, interaction with community, state and federal legislators, and lobbying and monitoring efforts in Washington, D.C. on issues such as research funding, student loans, and support for higher education. The records are physically arranged in the manner in which they arrived in the archives. In this finding aid the records are described by their intellectual organization and similar material for the various accessions is described and listed together. Researchers should note that later accessions often extend records series and topics from prior accessions.</p>
      <p>The records of the University of Michigan Office of the Vice President for Government Relations and Secretary of the university have been divided into the following series of material: University Budget, Topical Files, Office Assignments and Communication Records, Special Topical Files, Correspondence Files, Evolution of the Office, Audio-Visual Materials, Washington Office Files, and Vice President for University Relations Correspondence, .</p>

          <p>The University Budget series, 1968 to 1980, contains chronologically arranged records (and then arranged alphabetically within the span of years.) The bulk of the material consists of files related to the liaison process with state government agencies regarding the university's operating budget during these years. Included for most years are appropriations requests, capital outlay budget requests, documentation pertaining to the various requests, and materials documenting legislative budget hearings.</p>

            <p>The University Budget series, 1982-1994 (2.0 linear feet), is divided into two parts, 1982-1989 and 1990-1994 to maintain consistency with the office's organization of the files. The materials document the role of state government in the approval of the university's budget. The series includes files on budget analysis, appropriations bills, budget hearings, capital outlay requests, and funding strategies discussed at all-campus budget team meetings. For additional budget-related materials, the researcher may consult the Special Topical Files series.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files,1980-1997 (4.0 linear feet), are similar to the Washington office files, but tend to focus more on the duties of the Government Relations Office in Ann Arbor and mainly reflect monitoring and lobbying issues prior to the establishment of a permanent university office in Washington, D.C. in 1990. The majority of these files are from the 1980s. The series also documents the involvement of the University of Michigan in national higher education associations, particularly the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC).</p>

          <p>Office Assignments and Communication Records, 1969 to 1979 (4.0 linear feet), consists of two principle files: Assignments and Communication and Trip Records. The Assignments files is subdivided into files for 1976-1977 and 1977-1978. Both of these runs of files are alphabetically arranged, and cover a wide variety of topics, nearly all of them budget-related.</p>
          <p>The Communication and Trip Records file is arranged chronologically, and then alphabetically within the span of years. These files document the liaison communications and visits between the Office of the Vice President for Government Relations and Secretary of the University and various agencies of the state of Michigan, such as the Bureau of the Budget, Department of Education, and the House and Senate Fiscal Agencies.</p>

          <p>The materials in the Special Topical Files series, 1982-1994 (2.0 linear feet), differ from materials in the Topical Files series as the subjects here are primarily budget related. The series contains correspondence between the Vice President for Government Relations office and legislative bodies such as the Department of Management and Budget, the House Fiscal Agency, and House and Senate Appropriations committees. Other topics of interest are budget concerns of the Dearborn and Flint campuses, the Governor's budget recommendations, and the Research Excellence Fund applications submitted by various departments on campus.</p>

          <p>The initial organization and subsequent reorganizations of the Office of Government Relations and Secretary is described in the Evolution of the Office series, 1951-1994 (0.5 linear feet). Although materials in previous accessions describe the office activities more completely, the researcher may find the office organizational charts and staff meeting minutes in this series useful. The series is arranged chronologically, and ends with a small subseries of materials from Interim Secretary of the University Harold Johnson, who held the position from July 1994 to December 1994.</p>

          <p>The Washington Office Files series, 1984-1999 (5.0 linear feet), contains correspondence, memoranda and reports which document the wide variety of activities and interests for which the Washington, D.C. office is responsible. The files were transferred by Tom Butts, executive director of the university's Washington office and associate Vice President for Government Relations and the bulk of the documentation is from the 1990s. Topics covered include budgets and appropriations; research partnerships between the university and government agencies; indirect costs charged against research grants (including an audit of U of M charges); and tax and tuition legislation. Much of the documentation within this series pertains to the student loan advocacy activities performed by Tom Butts. Butts was a national authority in student loan reform and direct student lending, and the records detail his membership and involvement on committees and in organizations devoted to student loan issues.</p>

          <p>Vice President for University Relations Correspondence, 1989-1996 (1.0 linear feet), is comprised of outgoing correspondence (with some incoming letters attached) of Walter Harrison. The correspondence represents Harrison's duties first as executive director of University Relations and later as Vice President for University Relations with oversight for government relations. Correspondence consists mainly of letters written as a spokesman for the university and include letters to the editors of various area newspapers and responses written on behalf of the President. One folder of material, dated 1989-1990, details planning for a celebration in honor of former football coach and athletic director Bo Schembechler. The file includes a letter from Millie Schembechler.</p>
