    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Dr. Charles Gilbert Overberger, an educator and leader in the field of organic polymer chemistry, was born in the small town of Barnesboro, Pennsylvania, in 1920. In 1941, he graduated with a B.S. degree from Pennsylvania State University and then continued on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1944, studying under the direction of Dr. Carl "Speed" Marvel.</p>
      <p>After his formal academic training, Overberger held a postdoctoral fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1946 before obtaining the position of assistant professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1947. He quickly assumed roles of greater leadership by earning promotions to professor of Chemistry and associate director in 1951, chairman of the Department of Chemistry from 1955 to 1963, and then finally dean of Science and director of the Polymer Research Institute in 1964. He held this post at the Polytechnic Institute until coming to the University of Michigan as professor and chairman of the Department of Chemistry in 1967. At U of M Overberger was also charged with the responsibility of setting up the new Macromolecular Research Center. He accomplished this task with success and was rewarded for his efforts by being appointed vice-president of Research in 1972. In 1983, Dr. Overberger returned to the Department of Chemistry as a member of the faculty until his retirement in 1989.</p>
      <p>Although Overberger held numerous administrative positions, both in educational institutions and in various professional organizations, he still found time to pursue his research interests in the fields of synthetic organic reaction mechanisms and polymer chemistry. These projects provided both biochemists and polymer chemists the understanding of basic conformational and structural principles of biopolymers. As a result, Overberger was invited to lecture throughout the world, worked as a consultant for industry and government, and won many prestigious awards, as well as the respect of his peers. His wife, Betty, accompanied him on many of his travels. Overberger also had four children, Erica, Carla, Charles Thomas, and Ellen Ann, from a previous marriage.</p>
      <p>Dr. Overberger was a member of the American Chemical Society, the Chemical Society, the American Institute of Chemists, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Society of Chemical Industry, Alpha Chi Sigma, Phi Lambda Upsilon, and Sigma Zi. He was also a member of the Phi Eta Sigma, Phi Kappa Pi, and Sigma Pi and received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Holy Cross College, Long Island University, and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Awards include the New York Award of the American Institute of Chemists, the Witco Award in Polymer Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, The Distinguished Alumni Award of the Pennsylvania State University, The Charles Lathrop Parsons Award of the American Chemical Society, The Horace N. Potts Medal of the Franklin Institute, The International Award of the Society of Plastic Engineers, Michigan Scientist of the Year, the American Chemical Society Polymer Chemistry Division Award, and the American Chemical Society Paul S. Flory Polymer Education Award.</p>
      <p>Throughout his career, Overberger always cherished his work as an educator, teaching graduate-level chemistry courses and mentoring students interested in polymer research. He also served as editor for several professional journals including <title render="italic">the Journal of Polymer Science</title> <title render="italic">Advances in High Polymer Research</title> and was the first editor for <title render="italic">Macromolecular Syntheses.</title> Time was also contributed as a member of advisory boards for the <title render="italic">Polymer News, Macromolecules</title> and, <title render="italic">Organic Preparations and Procedures, International.</title></p>
      <p>In 1987, as Overberger was preparing for his retirement from the University of Michigan, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. While this did not initially restrict him from his educational and research activities, the disease's progression did eventually lead to the cessation of all professional activities. Charles Overberger died in 1997.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The papers of Dr. Charles G. Overberger are comprised of three series, Topical Files, Post Vice President of Research Activities, and Biographical Materials. These papers document his work as a professor, researcher, consultant, and expert in polymer chemistry, his administrative duties at the University of Michigan, and his career overall. The papers were originally filed and arranged by his various office assistants over the years and because of this constant attention to detail, have been preserved in the manner in which they arrived.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files (4.5 linear feet) series contains papers dating from 1957 to 1983 and are arranged alphabetically by each individual's name or institution. Correspondence comprises the bulk of the records, as Overberger had personal as well as professional relationships with many prominent chemists in his field. Transcripts of several of Overberger's various talks can be found arranged alphabetically by institution under the heading of Talks. Correspondence found in the many files devoted to various institutions also illustrates his activities as a popular speaker on the topic of polymer chemistry. Several photographs of Overberger and his cohorts are also scattered throughout the collection and are noted in parentheses in the box listing.</p>
