      <p>The position of vice-president for student services traces its institutional ancestry back through the vice-president for student affairs, to the director of the Office of Student Affairs, finally to the Office of the Dean of Students. Through all of these metamorphoses the office's primary responsibility was the administration of programs related to the life of the student outside of the classroom. This encompasses a broad spectrum of programs dealing with counseling, financial aid, student housing, student activities and organizations, the health service, student discipline, and fraternities. The office reflects the changing interests and composition of the student body and the increasing complexity of the University's administrative bureaucracy.</p>
      <p>Joseph A. Bursley, the first dean of students, took office February 1, 1921, to fulfill the Regents' dictate to act "as friend, counselor and guide to the student body and to have the general oversight of its welfare and of its general activities." Given this open-ended directive, Bursley soon found need to add an assistant dean and support staff to meet his mission tending to the housing, financial, social, and moral needs of students. By the time Bursley retired in 1945, the pattern of assuming increasing responsibilities with a larger staff and more complex bureaucracy was well established.</p>
      <p>The burgeoning bureaucracy, retirement of Bursley, and the University's growing enrollment combined to facilitate the creation of the Office of Student Affairs in September 1945. This was the first of a series of periodic efforts to define more clearly the duties of the various offices concerned with different aspects of students' lives outside the classroom. Erich A. Walter served as director of the Office of Student Affairs from 1945 until June 1954. Upon Walter's retirement, James A. Lewis was appointed vice-president for student affairs. This new title reflected the hierarchical nature of both the office and the university as a whole. Lewis stepped down in December 1964, after another reorganization of the office.</p>
      <p>During the latter half of the 1960s and early 1970s the University of Michigan campus was affected by student unrest, focused on the war in Vietnam as well as campus and national issues. Sit-ins, teach-ins, and more violent forms of student protest demanded the attention of the vice-presidents of student affairs and the University administration in general. Campus unrest had an impact on the Office of the Vice-President of Student Affairs and precipitated yet another reorganization of the office, this time to make it more responsive to student input. Richard L. Cutler served from December 1964 until the completion of the office reorganization in July 1968. Barbara W. Newell became acting vice-president on August 1, 1968 and served until September 1970. Robert Knauss succeeded her as the vice-president of the renamed Office for Student Services and held the post until February 1972. The changing of the guard, ongoing reorganization efforts, and the shift in focus to service stand as institutional testimony of the University's response to the chaotic times.</p>
      <p>The appointment of Henry Johnson as vice-president for student services in April 1972 brought a needed stability to the post and a measure of order to the situation. Under Johnson, structural changes were introduced to address the needs of some disaffected groups, who thought the University unresponsive to their needs. The offices of Minority Student Services and Disabled Student Services provided an official framework within which to advance interests. As time passed, the student body became less restive, and the vice-president turned his attention to more traditional aspects of non-academic student affairs. In January 1990 Henry Johnson was reassigned to the position of Vice President for Community Affair. Mary Ann Swain acted as interim vice president for student services from 1990 to 1992.</p>
      <p>In 1992, Maureen Hartford began her tenure as the vice president for student affairs. Hartford was previously the vice provost for student affairs at Washington State University and quickly rose to the task by focusing on issues such as the Student Code of Conduct, alcohol abuse, living/learning programs and students rights and responsibilities. In April 1999, Hartford left her position to assume the presidency of Meredith College in North Carolina. E. Royster Harper, who had served as the senior associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students then assumed the role of the interim vice president for student affairs. In November 2000, Harper was appointed vice president of student affairs.</p>

      <p>The records of the Vice-President for Student Services provide a unique perspective to the extracurricular life and customs of students at the University of Michigan and an insight to the development of the office of the vice-president. The records span the years 1908-1985 with the bulk of the material covering 1965-1985. The material from the early years is especially rich in documenting student life from the 1920s to the 1950s. The strongest feature of this collection is in documenting the administration's response to the changing needs of students, ranging from disciplining drinkers during Prohibition, dealings with fraternities up to 1960, reacting to student protests in the 1960s to the 1988 debate over the Student Code for Non-Academic Conduct. The papers also contain materials related to students' health, housing, organizations, and activism. The coverage of these areas varies across administrations as office reorganizations altered the focus and functions of Student Services.</p>
      <p>This uneven documentation reflects the fact that, over time, different offices were created to handle more narrowly-defined areas of responsibility. Areas which had originally been handled by Dean Bursley under his broad conception of control over non-academic student life came to be administered by separate offices. Frequently the records of these administrative units were not included with the vice-president for student services records. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of student life, as refracted through the lens of University Administration, one should also refer to the records of the Housing Office and Student-Community Relations Office, and the papers of Peter Ostafin, director of housing.</p>
      <p>The Vice-President for Student Services collection consists of correspondence, reports, memos, minutes, and financial reports generated by both the University Administration and students. These materials are arranged in chronological series by the administrative head in charge of students' extracurricular affairs. The seven series are: Joseph A. Bursley, 1913-1950; Erich A. Walter, 1925-1959; James A. Lewis, 1908-1964; Richard L. Cutler, 1950-1969; Barbara W. Newell, 1965-1970; Robert L. Knauss, 1962-1973; Henry Johnson, 1950-1985. This organizing scheme required some manipulation of the files, but it best enables the researcher to trace the changing nature of the student body concerns and the development of the office itself.</p>
      <p>The researcher should note that the strict chronological sequencing of the series was not possible. This was due in large part to a series of office reorganizations which resulted in some files created during Bursley or Walter's tenure ending up in later series. The most significant move here resulted in Lewis' series containing a good deal of Bursley and Walter materials on fraternities and student organizations. Lewis created the fraternities subseries in 1959 and compiled the student organization subseries during a May 1963, office reorganization. The researcher should also be conscious that early series contain a variety of materials which may not reflect the full scope of Bursley, Walter, or Lewis' responsibilities. Gaps are also discernible in the later series, but these are more readily fleshed out by referring to other University collections.</p>

          <p>The Joseph A. Bursley series comprises fourteen linear inches and consists of four subseries: Correspondence, Harmon Foundation Correspondence, South American Relations Correspondence, and Topical files. The three correspondence subseries are arranged chronologically within each run. Much of the correspondence reflects Bursley's tendency to take personal interest in student affairs. Bursley virtually exudes an aura of paternalism in his letters as he disciplines wayward youths. The fact that Bursley handled scholarships, student aid, fraternities, and housing in addition to student discipline, attests to the eclecticism of his job. The topical file here is an amalgam of Bursley materials which had been scattered amid subsequent Vice Presidents' files. It is here that Bursley's decisions on fraternity and housing problems are revealed.</p>

          <p>The Erich A. Walter records are thin but illuminating. Evidently this material originally consisted of fragments of three distinct topical files. These have been collapsed into one alphabetical file of eight linear inches. Even though the Walter material is fragmentary, the expansion of the office's responsibilities are discernible. Walter's handling of fraternity affairs, housing, counseling, and health services are fairly documented. The most interesting materials are the 1948 orientation scrapbook and the files on veterans. As the G.I. Bill opened the doors of higher education to a larger population, the Office for Student Affairs stepped up its efforts to reach out and inform these new students of the nuances of the University.</p>

          <p>James A. Lewis oversaw an office reorganization which resulted in the creation of two historical files. One organized all correspondence with fraternities alphabetically by fraternity. This fraternities correspondence subseries comprises eighteen inches of the James A. Lewis series and includes material dating back to the Walter and Bursley eras. This is the first area a researcher should investigate to find how the administration dealt with social, academic, and individual problems with fraternities. Much of the material here reflects the work of assistants to the vice-president, William Zerman and William Cross. The second historical file is the Student Organization subseries which Lewis created in the May 1963 office reorganization. This subseries is arranged alphabetically by organization and contains material documenting organized student interests from 1908 to 1963. The materials in this subseries consists of correspondence, constitutions, memos, and fliers on a broad range of student groups. Files of interest are: American Student Union, Committee for Civil Rights, Gargoyle, J-Hop, Michigan Youth for Democratic Action, and Young Progressives of Michigan. The last Lewis subseries is a topical file documenting his administrative concerns for fraternities, student affairs, and student government.</p>

          <p>In the mid-1960s, students' concerns shifted from social life in fraternities to more political issues of student governance on campus and to broader areas of protest. The Richard L. Cutler series echoes this debate as questions regarding student autonomy and dissent arise in each of the subseries. The Cutler series comprises eighteen inches and consists of four subseries: Administrative, Housing, Student Organization, and Topical. Each subseries is arranged alphabetically and reflects Cutler's organizational scheme. The Administrative and Housing materials reflect students demands for more control over their lives on campus in the files on student participation in University affairs and the dormitory visitation file. Student organizations and topical materials reflect the alienated, activist segment of the student population in the files of Students for a Democratic Society, Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, and Vietnam Protests.</p>

          <p>The Barbara W. Newell series parallels the Cutler series in many respects. Its Administrative, Housing, and Topical subseries constitute eighteen linear inches and are arranged alphabetically within the subseries. The Housing materials were generated by John Feldkamp and evidently consist of that part of Feldkamp's file which ended in the vice-president's records. As with Cutler, Newell's Administrative and Topical files are a rich source with which to examine administration response to student unrest. The bulk of materials in both subseries reflects Newell's attempts to balance the demands of various alienated student protestors with the desires to keep order in the University community. The researcher should note that Newell's organizing format included Student Organizations within the Administrative files.</p>

          <p>Beginning with the Robert L. Knauss series, the vice-presidents for Student Services organized their current materials into topical files by academic year. Since Knauss' tenure spanned less than two academic years, this topical file has been compressed into a single run. Even so, the Knauss topical file subseries is fragmentary. The Historical (Subject Reference) subseries is more extensive, comprising ten of the fifteen linear inches of Knauss material. It is also a richer source of material for both the traditional health, housing, and student organization concerns of Student Services and the temporally bound issues of student unrest.</p>

            <p>This Annual Files is arranged by academic year, 1972-1973 to 1984-1985 and thereunder alphabetically. This format closely conforms to the original order of Johnson's materials. The researcher should be aware that the annual files are of uneven depth and breadth. As the annual files tend to contain materials spanning several years, the unevenness of amounts of materials is smoothed. Recurrent themes in Johnson's files include: Housing, Health Services, Counseling, Student Government, Michigan Union, University Activities Center, Career Planning and Placement, Disabled Student Services and Minority Affairs. These last two fields reflect the office's capacity for expansion to provide an enduring institutional framework within which to advance the interests and needs of special categories of students. Johnson's notes on the Executive Officers minutes provide an interesting insight into the dynamics of these meetings.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files (17.5 linear feet) are arranged alphabetically. Specific files known to have been generated by a particular sub-unit have been placed under that sub- unit's name. Reports have been placed with the files of the unit that generated or collected them. When Vice President Maureen Hartford started her tenure in 1992, the name of the office changed from Vice President for Student Services to Vice President for Student Affairs. Files in this series from the office of Henry Johnson are found under the heading "Student Services, Office of". As with previous accessions, the topical files are comprised of correspondence, reports, memos, minutes and financial reports. In addition, the researcher will find program grants/proposals and student organization listings.</p>
            <p>A variety of topics ranging from child care to Michigan Stadium policy are covered in this series. The term See Also has been incorporated in the contents list to direct researchers to headings that contain material of a related nature. An index (page 37) has been added which contains commonly used terms and names and provides their actual contents list headings. A list of commonly used acronyms is found on page ix. When examining the files under a specific topic, the researcher should inspect "General" folders as well as folders with specific headings. Additionally, the researcher should inspect the correspondence of Henry Johnson which is located under the heading "Johnson, Henry.". The correspondence, which is in chronological order, contains information relevant to various topics found throughout the series.</p>
            <p>The overall function of the Office of Student Services is best documented in the "Historical Information" and "Goals and Objectives" folders. The "Minutes of the Director's Meetings" are also useful. These biweekly staff meetings were attended by Vice President Johnson and the director of each Student Service sub-unit. Topics discussed at these meetings and found in the minutes include presidential directives, unit updates, and student concerns. When examining the records of various sub-units, the researcher should always consult the contents of the "Monthly Reports to the Vice President" and any "Goals/Purpose" folders. They provide the best summaries of the focus of the individual sub-units and areas in which they concentrated their efforts.</p>
            <p>One of the strengths of the records in this series is documentation of the response by the university to drug use on campus during the 1970s. The Drug Education Project, funded by the U.S. Office of Education and the Office of Student Services, was created to integrate drug education and training into the daily life of the university. Four target groups were selected: staff in residence halls, counseling facilitators, students in the social sciences and administrators. After training they, in turn, educated students about the problems associated with using drugs and the resources available to assist those with drug difficulties. Some of the best documentation concerns the training of the Resident Assistants and how they were to interact with students under their jurisdiction. Another response by the university was the publication of the booklet About Drugs Again. This booklet, an updated version of All About Drugs, was published and distributed by the Drug Education Project. Considered an "abstract of factual information" about drugs, it was distributed to all students living in university owned housing. About Drugs Again was intended to educate the individual about the harmful effects of drug use and to enable the individual to discuss drugs in an informed manner. The files on this booklet provide good insight to the concerns the university had regarding the drug problem. The files on About Drugs Again can be found under the heading "Drugs". Other headings that have related information are "Alcohol," "Substance Abuse," and "Counseling Services." The latter sub-unit generated several interesting reports on substance abuse at the university.</p>
            <p>Another area well documented in the series is the struggle of minority students for recognition, especially African Americans. The folders within "Minority Students" document the need of Native Americans, African Americans and Chicano Americans to be represented within the university bureaucracy by a liaison/advocate. The "Afro-American Cultural Living Unit" file under "Housing" provides good documentation of the unsuccessful drive to create separate living centers on campus for African Americans and those interested in African heritage. The William Monroe Trotter House, organized in 1971, was established to serve as a center for Black student needs, both educational and social. The Trotter House provided study areas, meeting rooms for faculty and staff, formal and informal classes, orientation for high school students, and social activities. The struggle of African Americans for acceptance and recognition on campus is further documented under the headings "Office of Minority Affairs," "Discrimination," "Diversity," "Racism," and the several "Black" organizations. The establishment of "Diversity Day" (originally Martin Luther King Day) by the university in 1987 acknowledged the contributions of the many minorities on campus. The "Diversity Day" files, found under the heading "Diversity," contain listings of the many university sponsored activities for this event. The "International Center" files document such topics as enrollment, orientation, and immigration regulations pertaining to foreign students at the university.</p>
            <p>Project Community, a unit of Student Services, consists of student-run volunteer programs concentrated primarily in the Ann Arbor community. Recognized nationally, Project Community has two main goals: to provide individual attention to students of all ages and to stimulate new approaches and techniques in education. This program includes a mental health half-way house, a day care project, a resource center, tutorial programs for public school children, and community service programs in which undergraduate students worked with local social welfare agencies. Many of the projects sponsored by Project Community are documented in its files.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files, 1960-1991, (.8 linear feet) are alphabetically arranged, covering the period 1960-1991. It was received as separate accession in 1993 and includes material from the tenures of James A. Lewis, Richard L. Cutler, Barbara W. Newell, Robert L. Knauss, Henry Johnson, Mary Ann Swain and Maureen Hartford. The records from the tenure of Henry Johnson appear to parallel those of the Henry johns series (1989-1991 accession.) The researcher should therefore consult both series to find all materials on a given topic. The "Operations Reports, 1988-1989" are of interest, as they are indicative of the purpose and goals of the various sub-units.</p>
            <p>The researcher should consult the Bentley Historical Library's manuscript catalog for descriptions of other University of Michigan collections related to student life, including those described in the History section of the finding aid.</p>

            <p>The alphabetically arranged Topical Files, 1953-1995 (2 linear feet) were received in the several accessions from 1994-1998. The early years of this file document two activities, Michigras, a spring carnival and J-Hop a dance. These activities were supervised by Maurice Rinkel, the auditor of Student Organizations in the Office of Student Programs. A significant piece of the early 1970s documents are the records of the Ann Arbor Community Coalition. The coalition was the umbrella organization for four different programs, the Black Caucus Against Drugs, the Community Center Project, Drug Help and the OSS Drug Education Project. There were several reports made about the status of the drug problem in Ann Arbor by Herbert Wong and Thomas Greenfield, which the records contain. Of interest in the latter years covered by the records are several folders which contain papers from student groups that were campaigning for minority rights in the early 1990s. Mary Ann Swain's interim position as Vice President of Student Affairs is documented within the record group.</p>

          <p>The accession is comprised of the series Mary Ann Swain/Maureen Hartford, 1990-2005 (2 linear feet) was received as part of a 2002 accession with an addition made in 2013. The series includes records associated with campus improvement, classes, DSA Strategic Data Planning, experiences of women students, First Year Experience, health benefits, Leadership 2017 Program, campus safety, sexual orientation, surveys, and the undergraduate education statement. The records on campus improvement deal with various projects meant to improve the lives of students at the university. The records from classes have syllabi and material from the classes that Hartford taught at the university. The records from the DSA Strategic Data Planning committee include agendas and meeting minutes, mainly from committee retreats. The records on the experience of women include a report published by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, titled "Finding a Voice: Experiences of Women Students at the University of Michigan," as well as all the documentation associated with the various focus groups with women at the university which informed the creation of this report. The records of the First Year Experience Task Force span from its conception in early 1993 until the release of the report of the task force in 1996. The records are arranged into two components: Output of the task force (which contain associated memoranda and correspondence as well as the final report and bibliography) as well as Sources of the task force (which contain materials such as survey instruments, statements prepared for the task force and other university related materials which the Task Force used to pursue its findings.) The records on health benefits include information on proposed health benefits for students. The Leadership 2017 Program file is about a program proposed by academic affairs that taught leadership and how to better interact with students. The campus safety files include newspaper clippings, correspondence with parents and students, and various committee recommendations. The sexual orientation file contains articles and information relating to the housing division and gay/lesbian lifestyles. The files of surveys contain various surveys administered to students, including the results. The undergraduate education statement file has information on programs and statistics regarding undergraduate students. These records partially document Maureen Hartford's tenure as Vice President of Student Affairs and also touch upon Mary Ann Swain's interim position as Vice President of Student Affairs prior to that.</p>
