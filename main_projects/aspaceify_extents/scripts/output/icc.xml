      <p>The Inter-Cooperative Council (hereafter ICC) was created to coordinate the activities of student-founded cooperative houses. The cooperative houses were first organized during the Depression to provide University of Michigan students with an inexpensive alternative to university operated or privately owned rental properties.</p>
      <p>The Student Socialist Club organized the first cooperative house in 1932, named Michigan Socialist House. It was joined in 1936 by Rochdale House, a cooperative organized with the active assistance of Rev. H. L. Pickerill, student pastor of the Ann Arbor Disciples Church. In 1937 a third house, Alice Freeman Palmer House, organized itself. Both Rochdale and Palmer houses were organized along Rochdale principles, which included democratic operation, opposition to discrimination on the basis of race or religion and a neutral political position.</p>
      <p>In 1937 the three independent houses decided to form a joint body to enable them to purchase items in quantity. The organization formed was the Inter-Cooperative Council. Increasingly the ICC took on additional tasks. By 1941 the organization was responsible for all the houses' financing and the assignment of personnel to the various houses.</p>
      <p>In 1941 the ICC reached a pre-World War II peak of 12 houses. The war witnessed a decline in the number of affiliated houses, reflecting the overall decline in the student population. By war's end only 5 houses were still functioning.</p>
      <p>During World War II the ICC made a major policy change regarding the ownership of its constituent houses. Originally the structures occupied by ICC houses were rented. Difficulties regarding leases led the ICC to adopt, in 1944, a policy that the organization obtain legal title to all of the properties which constituent houses occupied. The decision to buy rather than rent property was quickly and successfully implemented. In 1950 of the six houses affiliated with the ICC, the organization held title to five of them and plans were well underway to purchase the sixth.</p>
      <p>Throughout the postwar period and continuing into the 1950s the ICC was plagued by slow growth and internal disputes. The most pressing internal difficulty involved a proposal to hire a full-time executive secretary to work for the ICC. Proponents saw the plan as a simple necessity in light of the ICC's acquisition of much property. Opponents argued that a full time, non-student employee would fatally compromise the Rochdale principle of democratic decision making. In 1951 the organization conducted a referendum in which the proposal to hire a full-time executive secretary narrowly passed. Opposition to the idea, however, continued throughout the 1950s. Luther Buchele was selected as first executive secretary of the ICC. He would serve in this capacity until 1985.</p>
      <p>In the early 1950s the ICC expressed an interest in obtaining property on the University of Michigan's North Campus for eventual expansion. Long and troubled negotiations with the University ensued, with many ICC members coming to believe that the University was purposely delaying the project. Specifically they felt the University Housing authorities and those responsible for student regulations saw the ICC as a competitor in the housing market and as an often effective source of opposition to student regulations. In any event, the long negotiations between university officials and the ICC culminated eventually in the construction of a large cooperative housing complex on North Campus, ground being broken for the project in 1969. In addition to the North Campus project, the ICC purchased several new properties in the central campus area during the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1979 the ICC owned 13 properties in the central campus area, as well as the North Campus complex. The next three decades would see further expansion and house reorganization.</p>
      <p>Further information about the organization's history will be found in the volume <title render="italic">In our own hands; a history of student housing cooperatives at the University of Michigan</title> (1994). This volume is located in the collection.</p>

          <p>The first series, the minutes file (1937-2005), originally consisted exclusively of minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors. In the 1960s, these files began including (in addition) minutes of various committees created by the board (e.g. Development Committee) and of meetings of the various houses. The series also contains bound volumes of minutes from the Board of Directors and the Education Committee. These may duplicate material found in the first part of this series.</p>

          <p>The office files (1932-1990) originally contained all documents other than the minutes, including all committee and officer reports, and all miscellaneous documents. The distinction between the two files, however, slowly began to break down. Increasingly documents related to the minutes, such as reports and documents related to items on the agenda, were filed with the minutes, while copies of the minutes found their way into the office files. By the 1970s the distinction between the two files had become largely artificial. After 1980, documentation in the office files is scattered.</p>

          <p>The Office Files (1932-1990) originally contained all documents other than the minutes, including all committee and officer reports, and all miscellaneous documents. The distinction between the two files, however, slowly began to break down. Increasingly documents related to the minutes, such as reports and documents related to items on the agenda, were filed with the minutes, while copies of the minutes found their way into the office files. By the 1970s the distinction between the two files had become largely artificial. After 1980, documentation in the Office Files is scattered.</p>

          <p>Printed Materials (1939-2011) are divided into two subseries: Manuals and Newsletters. The manuals provide how-to instruction in such diverse topics as food preparation, house maintenance, financial and accounts management, and the duties and responsibilities of co-op members. The newsletters include nearly complete runs of the <title render="italic">Cooperator</title>, <title render="italic">Alumni Cooperator</title>, and the <title render="italic">Weekly Cooperator</title>. The members of the Inter-Cooperative Council also produced other newsletters such as <title render="italic">The Bridge</title>, <title render="italic">The Co-op Eccentric</title>, and the <title render="italic">ICC's Bi-Weekly</title>.</p>

          <p>The Events and Programs series (1944-2009) consists of materials created in the planning and execution of various events and programs for the ICC. The materials are arranged in eight subseries by event. Annual events or programs appear first, arranged alphabetically: Annual meetings, Cooperator-in-residence program, Summer Education program, and Training, orientation sessions, and retreats. These are followed by periodic events: ICC-wide anniversary celebrations, House reunions, Regional reunions and then Miscellaneous. Within each subseries (with the exception of the Miscellaneous subseries), materials are arranged chronologically.</p>

          <p>The Organizational Topical Files (1932-2012) series includes annual reports, directories, and financial reports, as well as prospectuses which describe plans for a North Campus cooperative. This series also contains histories of the Inter-Cooperative Council such as <title render="italic">In Our Own Hands: A History of Student Housing Cooperatives at the University of Michigan</title> (1994). This volume has a detailed account of the development of the Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan with a list of the ICC presidents, a time-line which includes the purchase date and address of the various houses, and excellent photographs of the houses, residents, and house activities. Other materials in this series include those related to this "history book project," the Alumni association, committees (such as the Education Committee or the Diversity Committee), and Ann Arbor community relations.</p>

          <p>The material in the House Records series (1934-2010) document individual ICC houses and include a mixture of minutes, the constitution of the house, newsletters, photographs (most images, however, are found in the Audio-Visual series), and files relating to the history or administration of a house. The series is divided into 42 subseries; the first 39 correspond to the names of houses and are arranged alphabetically, from Bag-End to Zapata. materials in these subseries are arranged by document type: first minutes, then constitutions or rules, and other materials such as administrative, financial, or event records; house "history" files; or photographs. Following the subseries for the houses are materials for the Division Councils and Boarding Co-ops, including minutes and constitutions. The Multiple Houses subseries contains materials that relate to several houses, including sets of mixed or combined membership and financial records. The Legal and Financial Documents subseries includes materials relating to the legal purchase and ownership of the various houses. Within this subseries, materials are arranged by document type and then chronologically.</p>
