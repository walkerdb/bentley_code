      <p>Thomas Butts devoted his career to improving student financial aid and loan programs. He first worked for the University of Michigan from 1964 to 1977. He was an admissions counselor, 1964-1966; Assistant Director of Admissions, 1966-1967; Director of Student Orientation, 1967-1977; Assistant Director of ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) and CAPS (Counseling and Personnel Services), 1967-1977, and Director of Student Financial Aid, 1971-1977.</p>
      <p>While he was Director of Financial Aid, Thomas Butts was involved with the National Task Force on Student Aid Problems, a short-term working group charged with analyzing the process of applying for financial aid. It was active from May 1974 to July 1975. Thomas Butts was chair of the Working Committee for Common Form, which was involved in designing and testing a nation-wide form for applying for financial aid. The Task Force became the National Student Aid Coalition in 1975, and Thomas Butts served as the chair of the Committee on Need Analysis and Delivery, 1975-1977.</p>
      <p>In 1977, he took a leave of absence from the University of Michigan and served the federal government, from 1977 to 1981. He was a policy advisor for Student Financial Assistance, under the U.S. Office of Education, from 1977 to 1979. He then served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Student Assistance from 1979 to 1981, and was Acting Deputy Commissioner during the establishment of the Education Department. He was also involved in several task forces and committees dealing with specific issues at the time, including the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and was called upon to testify before congressional subcommittees.</p>
      <p>In 1981, he returned to the employ of the University of Michigan, where he remained until his retirement in 1999. He worked out of the university's Washington D.C. office, and was active in student loan legislation issues. He was the Government Relations Officer, 1981-1991; Executive Director of the Washington D.C. Office, 1990-1999; and Associate Vice President for Government Relations, 1991-1999. During this time, he was very active in promoting legislation for the Direct Loan Program. He also served as an adjunct faculty member for the Center for Higher and Postsecondary Education, from 1990 to 1999.</p>

      <p>This collection would be of use for research into the role of Thomas Butts at the University of Michigan, the role of the University of Michigan in student financial aid policy, and the evolution of federal student loan policy generally. The collection is composed of six series. The first five correspond to the positions Thomas Butts held (Office of Admissions, Office of Orientation, Office of Financial Aid, U.S. Department of Education, and Washington D.C. Office) and a sixth series, Loans, contains information on specific loan programs. The Loans series especially provides insight into how laws are developed in the federal government, including the evolution of the Higher Education Act and the Direct Loan program. Thomas Butts was involved with many organizations, and a glossary of the main acronyms follows the scope and content note.</p>

          <p>Office of Orientation series (0.5 linear feet, 1968-1975 and 2000) is mostly composed of papers on the professional organizations that Thomas Butts was a member of, or participated in conferences, during his time as the Director of Student Orientation and after. He was a presenter at many conferences (including ACPA, HEEA, MCPA, MPGA, New Directions, and AACRAO). The 1971 AACRAO speech is on audio cassette. Thomas Butts also served on the ACPA Commission II School-College Relations, Admissions and Orientation from 1970 to 1973. Also of note are evaluations of the program by participants and student leaders in 1968 and 1969, and two publications by Thomas Butts: "Freshman Placement" and "What is Orientation?" from 1969. Thomas Butts stayed in contact with the orientation community even after he left the position, and attended the AACRAO annual meeting in 2000.</p>

          <p>U.S. Department of Education series (1.0 linear feet, 1977-1987) covers the time when Thomas Butts worked for the federal government, as part of the U.S. Department of Education. He was most involved in the Office of Student Financial Assistance, where he was acting deputy commissioner for a time. Records include correspondence and reports of activities. The bulk of the records are correspondence files from 1978 and 1979, which reveal the daily routine of the U.S. Department of Education and involve many organizations and individuals voicing their opinions, as well as the response of the U.S. Department of Education. Most of the correspondence is of Ernest Boyer, U.S. Commissioner of Education, and Leo Kornfeld, Deputy Commissioner for Student Financial Assistance, then forwarded to Thomas Butts.</p>

          <p>Loans series (3.25 linear feet, 1968-2003) is the only series not tied to where Thomas Butts was working at the time. It covers issues pertaining to loan programs over time, and provides a look at how laws and programs are created and evolve at the federal level. The most significant student loan legislation is the Higher Education Act (HEA), which was established in 1965, and reauthorized in 1972, 1980, 1986, 1992, and 1998. The two other main student loan programs in this collection, the Guaranteed Student Loan and the Direct Student Loan programs, are both part of the Higher Education Act. Thomas Butts was particularly involved with advocating the Direct Loan Program. It was created in 1993, and began operation in the 1994/1995 academic year, to be studied in a 5 year program. Loans is divided into 7 subseries.</p>

            <p>"Papers" subseries (0.5 linear feet, 1977-1986, and 1993-2000) are analyses of student loan issues or programs. Several of the papers evaluate the entire federal financial aid system or the campus based funding system, and offer recommendations for new ones. Also of note is a paper covering the history of student aid programs, from the 1970s through the 1990s.</p>

            <p>"Higher Education Act" subseries (1.5 linear feet, 1972-2000) is divided into three sections. "Budget" (0.5 linear feet) covers negotiating and allocating the budget for financial aid programs from 1972 to 1988 and 2000. "Title IV" (0.25 linear feet) is from 1976 to 1977 and 2000. The 1976-1977 materials are hand-written notes covering forming ideas, drafting, and revising, and amending the law. The 2000 material is from negotiated rulemaking sessions on loan issues and program and flexibility issues. "Reauthorization" (0.75 linear feet) covers the reauthorization process for 1980, 1986, and 1992. These mostly consist of testimony before Congressional subcommittees regarding various aspects of the proposed reauthorization. They also include reports and studies on loan options, and correspondence from members of the financial aid community voicing their opinions and concerns. 1986 Reauthorization Correspondence to Congressmen includes many letters to William D. Ford, who would later sponsor the Direct Loan Program. The 1992 Reauthorization, NASULGC meeting includes statements by Congressmen Ford and Anderson.</p>

            <p>"Guaranteed Student Loans" subseries (0.5 linear feet, 1968-1979 and 1990) is topical files, arranged alphabetically. Of particular note are correspondence from 1978 in which different colleges explain their efforts to ensure access to financial aid for all students, which were sent to Thomas Butts as part of his U.S. Department of Education work, and discussions on how to cope with the problems of the middle income students from 1977 and 1978, called the "Middle Income Squeeze." The other files provide information and statistics on how the program functions, and discussions of other issues pertaining to the program.</p>
            <p>Direct Loan Program" (0.5 linear feet, 1991-2001). Thomas Butts was a strong advocate for the Direct Loan Program. It includes 4 sections. "Memos" (0.2 linear feet) are of different universities and the U.S. Department of Education discussing the Direct Loan Program. "National Direct Student Loan Coalition" includes meeting agendas and records of the executive committee, articles, and Thomas Butts' statement before the Government Reform Subcommittee in 1999. It is a nonprofit corporation founded in 1999. "Program Evaluations" are three analyses of the Direct Loan Program: one of cost, one of the market mechanism, and also a statement of support from University of Michigan President Duderstadt. "Publications" includes two articles, a paper, and a letter to the <title render="italic">Washington Post</title> by Thomas Butts, as well as an evaluation of the program by the U.S. Department of Education. The rest of the materials are reports on how the program works and school roster and default rates from 1998.</p>
