      <p>Formed in 1996, the M-Pathways Project was charged with the design and implementation of new administrative information systems for the University of Michigan. Until this point, administrative business transactions were performed using the Michigan Terminal System (MTS), an innovative mainframe operating system put in place in the late 1960s.1 MTS served the university until the mid-1980s, when significant advances in technology made the operating system inefficient. Technology changes during this period of time included the developments of the personal desktop computer, a systems platform to support client/server architecture, development of a network infrastructure through the design of the Wide Area and Local Area Information Services, and lastly, the graphical user interface.</p>
      <p>The origins of M-Pathways began in October 1993 when the Executive Computing Committee (ECC) charged the Strategic Data Planning (SDP) team with developing a comprehensive strategy for the integration of the university's administrative data systems. An objective of the strategy was to streamline business processes across organizational boundaries. The SDP team was led by John Gohsman of the Information Technology Division (ITD). In developing the strategic plan, the team actively solicited input through focus group interviews from over 350 administrative users in central administrative units and in schools and colleges. The entire process focused on defining institutional goals, formulating an institution-wide conceptual data and process model, integrating and analyzing processes and data resources, and creating and maintaining a strategic plan for process innovation, quality improvement, and systems development projects. The final SDP report, published in March 1995, resulted in identifying over fifty-five data and process projects as well as twelve projects focused on technical infrastructure improvements.</p>
      <p>Goals of the SDP process included enhancing services to students from recruitment through alumni contact, providing accessible and shared data, supporting decentralized decision-making, and providing comprehensive data to support analysis of institutional needs. SDP projects were categorized into Data Infrastructure, Technology Infrastructure, Process Innovation, Quality Improvement, Systems Development, and Data Access projects. Underlying the recommendations resulting from the SDP process was the viewpoint that the university should integrate its databases to facilitate sharing data across organizational boundaries.</p>
      <p>In January 1996, the university signed a $3.5 million contract with PeopleSoft, Inc. to provide the university with software to redesign the financial, human resources, and student information systems. PeopleSoft, established in 1987, was at this time a market leader for client/server technologies for enterprise-wide human resources information management systems. PeopleSoft was interested in developing software solutions for the higher education market. Contract negotiations with the university included the Student Administration sub-project of M-Pathways as a Beta Partner in the design of PeopleSoft's Student Administration Information System. Other Beta partners included Cornell University, James Madison University, Southern Methodist University, Houston Community College, Northern Arizona University, and California State University at Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>It was estimated that the three administrative systems would be in place before the year 2000. The target year of 2000 was important since there was concern that systems dependent on date routines for processing would fail after December 1999. Following the decision to partner with PeopleSoft, team leaders worked to move from the conceptual plan to a working project by defining the scope and organizational structure for the project. It was in the months following the contract signing that the project formulated its identity by adopting a name and slogan <title render="italic">, M-Pathways: Connecting people and information</title>, drafting a project charter, and defining the project management and organizational structure. The management structure was designed to consist of two groups: the Process Management Lead Team (PMLT) and the Core Process Management Team (CPMT). The PMLT acted as the project steering committee. The PMLT was charged with overseeing, delegating, and monitoring all activities, including funding, to the CPMT. The PMLT charge included determining funding sources, facilitating the timely acquisition of resources, approving details of the PeopleSoft contract, facilitating organizational restructuring to support redefined business processes, reviewing policies related to data access and privacy, and providing project schedule guidance to the CPMT. The CPMT was responsible for directing the project implementation. This included developing the project structure, planning and administering the project budget, and planning and managing project communications, as well as training for project team and end users including documentation, consulting, and hot-line support. The next level in the structure consisted of the PeopleSoft Project Implementation Team (PS PIT). This team was responsible for process innovation and all activities related to the implementation of the hardware and software. The organizational structure was complete in September 1996 when Laura Patterson, University Registrar, was appointed Project Manager. At about the same time, a centralized working "space" was secured in the Administrative Services Building to manage project activities.</p>
      <p>Project teams formed for each of the sub-projects drew much of their personnel from the university's administrative offices. Persons appointed to a Co-Development role had a 50% appointment to the project and 100% appointment time was expected of persons selected to work on the implementation teams. Persons with technical expertise were selected from the Information Technology Division (ITD). The project itself was divided into five "sub-projects": Financial, Human Resources, Physical Resources, Research Administration, and Student Administration. Each sub-project was designed to have both a functional and a technical project manager. It was the responsibility of the sub-managers within each sub-project to implement the software within their system area, assign resources, manage the budget for the sub-project, determine the need for consulting, and to direct the development of integrated end-user training across the project. Functional managers were drawn from the administrative business offices and technical leads were largely drawn from ITD. As the project geared up Anderson Consulting, Inc. supplied additional resources. Anderson Consulting provided the overall project methodology, technical support, and staff support in the area of "change management."</p>
      <p>In addition to the functional and technical components of the organization, the project structure incorporated an integrated communications effort. Communication to administrative users was viewed as a top priority as the implementation of the systems involved rethinking how current business processes could be improved rather than just automating existing processes. To facilitate the transition from the current to the future way of doing business, Gretchen Weir was appointed communications coordinator for the project. Communication efforts included targeted electronic mail communications, faculty and staff "Interchange" sessions, a comprehensive project website, and regularly published articles in the <title render="italic">University Record</title>. In addition, to further facilitate the change process, an unit liaison program was formed. The program included one representative from each unit that would be affected by the PeopleSoft systems. Unit Liaisons received regular communications from the Unit Liaison Coordinator, Jan Eckert, and were asked to attend Unit Liaison meetings, workshops, and focus groups for each of the sub-projects. Unit Liaisons were charged with communicating the information they gathered about changes in process, policy, and procedures back to the appropriate persons in their respective units. While the project had personnel in place with responsibility for communications to the end-users, the Change Management aspect of the project was represented both horizontally and vertically in the structure of the project organization. Change Management efforts included assistance in developing training guides, teaching courses, facilitating focus groups, communicating project developments including policy and procedural changes to end users, and end-user support services.</p>
      <p>While the Human Resources System was originally earmarked to be the first system in operation, it was the Asset Management module of the Physical Resources System (PRS), headed by Mike Easter, that was first to roll out to the university in the fall of 1996. The Financial Resources System followed the roll-out of the PRS on July 1, 1998. While it was hoped that PeopleSoft would develop tools to support Research Administration, it was decided in August 1999 that the Research Administration sub-project would resume systems development within the university's Division of Research Development and Administration (DRDA).</p>
      <p>As the first phase towards seamlessly servicing students from recruitment through admission and graduation, the Recruiting and Admissions module was the first module of the Student Administration system to roll out in 1998. All other student modules except for Degree Audit were put in operation in July 2000. Starting with the fall 2000 term, students registered for classes on-line through a specially designed interface called Wolverine Access. The "new" Wolverine Access was an extension of the Wolverine Access system developed in 1994. Initially, Wolverine Access functionality provided students on-line access to term grades, to the unofficial transcript, and to personal address information. The M-Pathways project further enhanced a student's view of student related data to include all components of the registration process, views of the current time schedule, account information, and a view of the university's course catalog data. At the time this history was written, the last PeopleSoft system to be implemented, Human Resources, was scheduled to be in operation on July 1, 2001.</p>
      <p>In 1999, project management began efforts to address what was referred to as "Life After M-Pathways." It was realized that once the systems were in operation the project needed to move from project status to an organization designed to enhance, service, and maintain the systems. The first step towards moving the project from project to organization was the development of a Core Process Unit (CPU) for each of the sub-projects. The organizational structure of the CPU would mirror the project organization. Each CPU would have functional, technical, and communications support personnel. For the next phase of envisioning the type of organization needed to support the systems and changed processes across the university, an external consultant with expertise in organizational structure was utilized. The change in organizational structure would include personnel from the project, the Information Technology Systems, and the Data Administration Systems Center. To facilitate the change to the new organization, project management led numerous sessions with project personnel affected by the change both as a means to conceptualize and to facilitate the change. Comments on possible organizational models were solicited throughout the process. The end result was the formation of a wholly new organization, the Michigan Administrative Information Services (MAIS). MAIS officially began operation on July 1, 2000. The organization is comprised of five units: Financial/Physical Resources, Student Administration, Application Services, Technical Infrastructure Operations, and User Services. Laura Patterson was named Vice President for Administrative Systems effective September 22, 2000.</p>

      <p>When the M-Pathways Project started in the Fall of 1996, several decisions were made about the way the design and implementation of the five new information systems would proceed. One of these decisions was how to organize project documentation. It was decided to centralize the team's work in a number of Lotus Notes databases. While project communications within Lotus Notes indicate that using "Notes" was very new for most project members, however, it was considered the most useful electronic storage format at the time. Several databases were initially set up, and over the course of the project additional databases were added. The earliest databases include the Big Ten Discussion and the Strategic Data Plan Documentation Library. For each of the databases, whether stored in paper or electronic format, the archivist has documented the original structure and views available within the database. This documentation includes title of database, date created, quantity, bulk dates, preservation format, and database views. This information is in a folder titled "Archivist's Documentation on Lotus Notes Databases" located in Box 1 of the record group. The record group consists of six series: Communications, Organizational, Student Administration, Technology Administration, Videotape, and Website.</p>

          <p>The Communications series (1.5 linear feet) includes documentation that reflects the project's enterprise-wide unit liaison program, end user support, and efforts towards involving users in the design of the systems. In this series one will find comprehensive "Performance Support" plans which show how change management personnel meticulously planned for the change in the systems environment. A "snapshot" of the Change Management (CM) Deliverables database is included in this series on CD-ROM (located in Box 1). This database includes additional performance support and what was titled "gap" documentation. These materials are useful indicators of the change in work processes that the "change management" professionals foresaw with the implementation of the new system. Documentation on the training program can also be found in this subseries. A researcher interested in the enterprise-wide training effort should also consult the M-Pathways Project publications record group. The publications record group contains numerous training manuals for each of the five systems implementation projects. The training manuals not only detail specific business procedures but also, include related university adopted policies</p>

          <p>The Organizational series (3 linear feet) contains the key documents that shaped the project. The series contains the project charter, scope documents, and methodology plan. The vision for data delivery and the design of the data warehouse are also part of this series. The series contains meeting minutes and agendas for the Project Management Lead Team (PMLT) and PeopleSoft Implementation Team (PS PIT). Evidence of the technical standards set by the project can be found in the Lotus Notes MAIS Standards/Procedures database, located on CD-ROM (located in Box 1). Technical standards include access and security standards, development, migration, application testing, convoy, and production support standards. The series includes documentation that reflects the reorganization envisioned for the project in documentation titled "Life After M-Pathways" which begins to address the vision for the organizational structure of the project once the system became operational. Lastly, the series includes the Strategic Data Plan Documentation Library database in a printed format.</p>

          <p>The Student Administration series (5 linear feet) is divided into two subseries: Student Beta Project and Topical. The Student Beta Project subseries provides a comprehensive view of Michigan's involvement with PeopleSoft to develop a student administration system for the higher education market. The subseries includes electronic mail (print-outs) from other "Beta Partners" in the Big Ten Conference. The electronic mail captures the initial set-up struggles each of the schools experienced in undertaking this massive project. The correspondence also shows the collaborative efforts between Big Ten schools and the use of electronic mail as a tool to collect and discuss shared problems with the design of the PeopleSoft systems. The subseries also includes the system prerelease documentation, as well as software documentation.</p>

            <p>The Student Beta Project subseries provides a comprehensive view of Michigan's involvement with PeopleSoft to develop a student administration system for the higher education market. The subseries includes electronic mail (print-outs) from other "Beta Partners" in the Big Ten Conference. The electronic mail captures the initial set-up struggles each of the schools experienced in undertaking this massive project. The correspondence also shows the collaborative efforts between Big Ten schools and the use of electronic mail as a tool to collect and discuss shared problems with the design of the PeopleSoft systems. The subseries also includes the system prerelease documentation, as well as software documentation.</p>

            <p>The Topical subseries focuses mainly on the implementation phase of the student system modules. The subseries is reflective of the methodology used for all five system implementations. Evidence of the methodology can be found in the documentation of current business processes and "To Be" process flows. The subseries includes module scope documents and data entity diagrams. Researchers interested in further examination of the methodology used by the project, as well as the design of the system may want to consult the Student Administration System SAS design deliverables database and the Student Information System (SIS) Pathways database located on CD-ROM (Box 1). The SAS design deliverables database holds the documents that reflect the first phase of the project methodology, the Design Phase. The organization of the database reflects the structure of the methodology. The structure of the methodology follows a sequence of activities, tasks, and deliverables. Note that each level has a corresponding numerical identifier, thus, all documents are referenced by this number. Deliverables in the design phase include identification of the Business Objectives for the Student System, a survey of the Information Needs, and Profiles of the Current Systems, Business Processes, Interfaces, Reports, and Users. The design phase documentation provides a very focused snapshot of the work processes and procedures in place in the administrative offices at the university in the late 1990s. The SIS Pathways database includes meeting minutes from the functional lead and technical team meetings, discussion documents on the campus community module, proposed table values for the academic advising and admissions modules, and discussion documents related to the design of the web interface for student registration.</p>

          <p>The Technology Administration series (1.5 linear feet) consists largely of the University of Michigan PeopleSoft (UMPS) Technical Discussion Database. The database is available in printed form and is also on CD-ROM (located in Box 1). The database was designed for documents related to the design of the technical architecture, implementation of technology, and technology related policy and procedures. The database served as a means for discussion on specific technical issues. When used for discussion, it appears that the Technical Infrastructure Lead Manager, William Wrobleski, marked the opening of the discussion with a document announcing the discussion point. Other technical team members would then submit responses on the specific technical issue within the area that Wrobleski placemarked in the database for that discussion thread. While some of the discussions resulted only in a few responses, the Citrix WinFrame discussion is a good example of the depth of some of the discussion threads. This discussion also includes a good example of the information sharing utilized in the project across other technical teams in the Big Ten. The technical documents in this database span from 1995 to 2000.</p>

          <p>The WEBSITE series (391 digital documents, 46.4 MB) was first captured via Teleport Pro software application in November 2000. The website series is divided into ten subseries: Financial Administration System, Getting Started with the M-Pathways System, Help Desk, Human Resources System, Library Documentation, Physical Resources System, Project Overview, Research Administration System, Student Administration System, and Training. This series includes the entire contents of the M-Pathways Project website as it appeared on the capture date. The 2000 capture includes HTML, Excel, PDF, and PowerPoint files. The M-Pathways project website targets as its primary audience the University of Michigan administrative system user. The Project Overview subseries, however, does contain organizational project information that would be of interest to other Universities and Colleges undergoing similar system projects. As well, the Wolverine Access section in the Student subseries includes registration information and procedures targeted to university students.</p>

          <p>The Archived Website series (176.7 MB) documents various components of the M-Pathways project. The website targets as its primary audience the University of Michigan administrative system user, although some sections, such as the "Project Overview" would be of interest to a broader audience. The series is arranged chronologically and includes content captured by the Internet Archive starting in 1997 as well as captures provided by Bentley Library archivists in 2000 and 2006. Content includes announcements, publications (such as newsletters), documentation of procedures, and information on the Human Resources System, Physical Resources System, Research Administration System (2000 version), Student Administration System, data delivery (2006 version), and associated training.</p>
