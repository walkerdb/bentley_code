      <p>An internationally renowned social psychologist, Leon Festinger was responsible for the development of the theory of cognitive dissonance in the 1950s. He taught only briefly at the University of Michigan (1948-1951) but is considered to be one of the founders of the university's Institute for Social Research. In his later career, he researched and published in a number of other fields including visual perception, archaeology and early human history.</p>
      <p>Born in New York City in 1919, Leon Festinger received his B.S. from City College of New York in 1939. He studied under Kurt Lewin, a pioneer in social psychology, at the University of Iowa where he received his M.A. in 1940 and Ph.D. in 1942. His early interest was in precise quantitative measurements in psychology as is reflected in his doctoral dissertation based on a mathematical model of decision-making. During World War II, Festinger worked as a senior statistician for the Committee on Selection and Training of Aircraft Pilots at the University of Rochester. In 1945, he joined Kurt Lewin, Ronald Lippitt, and several other psychologists as an assistant professor at the Research Center for Group Dynamics of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At the center, research was oriented toward the study of social action and real-world social problems and Festinger gradually became more interested in problems in social psychology.</p>
      <p>When Kurt Lewin died in 1947, the young research center at M.I.T. was faced with dissolution but shortly found a new home in Ann Arbor. Many years later, Festinger explained the move to the University of Michigan when he wrote, "With the help of Rensis Likert, director of the Survey Research Center, and Donald Marquis, head of the Psychology Department, we moved the Research Center for Group Dynamics in 1948, faculty, students and all, to the University of Michigan, where we, together with the Survey Research Center, constituted a newly created Institute for Social Research. Thus, Michigan, which already had Theodore Newcomb and Daniel Katz on its faculty, became a huge institution with regard to social psychology." While at Michigan, Festinger co-edited <title render="italic">Research Methods in the Behavioral Sciences</title>- a widely used text in psychology.</p>
      <p>In 1951, Festinger left Michigan for the University of Minnesota and then in 1954 he moved on to Stanford University. While at Stanford, he published some of his most important works in social psychology. <title render="italic">A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance</title> appeared in 1957. This theory holds that dissonance between two sets of ideas or values is tension provoking for an individual and that various strain-reducing techniques will be utilized by that individual to make the two sets consonant. A field study of cognitive dissonance, <title render="italic">When Prophecy Fails</title>, was also published while Festinger was at Stanford. This work was based upon observations of a religious group which believed that they would be rescued by space ships before the world ended in a giant flood on December 21, 1954.</p>
      <p>In 1964, Festinger's research interests changed. As he explained in <title render="italic">Retrospections on Social Psychology</title>, which he edited, "I left the field of social psychology in 1964. This had nothing to do with the importance of the problems - they are very important - or with the vitality of the field - it was, and remains, vigorous. It had to do only with a conviction that had been growing in me at the time that I, personally, was in a rut and needed an injection of intellectual stimulation from new sources to remain productive." Festinger turned his attention to the study of perception and consciousness and, in particular, to visual perception. Through a careful technical analysis of eye movements, he hoped to discover how an internal readiness to receive visual information combined with the incoming visual input to produce the conscious experience of visual perception.</p>
      <p>In 1968, Festinger left Stanford to become the Else and Hans Staudinger Professor of Psychology at the New School for Social Research in New York City. At the New School, he continued his work on the measurement of visual perception and authored many journal articles on this subject during the 1970s. Around 1978, his academic interests again changed focus. He began a study of the social organization of pre-historic groups and especially the development of specialized functions within these groups. The results of this research, based largely upon archaeological sources, were published in his monograph <title render="italic">The Human Legacy</title>, in 1983.</p>
      <p>While Festinger's intellectual pursuits changed over the years, certain interests remained constant. Throughout his career, he was considered to be an especially insightful reviewer and his critical judgements were eagerly sought by book publishers, journal editors, and many organizations. He served as a consultant to governmental, military, and private institutions. He also maintained a keen interest in international scholarly cooperation. He participated in many international conferences, was a visiting professor in Japan, and an Einstein Visiting Fellow in Israel. He also kept up a wide circle of international correspondence. Among his many honors, Festinger was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He also received the Distinguished Scientist Award from the American Psychological Association and an honorary doctorate from the University of Mannheim.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Leon Festinger papers document the career of one of the leading psychologists of our time. Material exists from all phases of his career and shows evidence of his work in social psychology, visual perception, and pre-historic social organization. However, as Festinger noted on several occasions, much material was jettisoned to lighten the load for each move to a new university. Consequently, more documentation exists from his later career (especially after the mid-1960s) than from earlier periods. Except for occasional reminiscences, very little information is included regarding time spent at the University of Michigan or his association with the Institute for Social Research. While the collection contains only limited primary research material, references to that research and to his many experiments in social psychology and perception may be found in his correspondence. His activities as a reviewer, consultant, and proponent of international academic cooperation are especially well-documented in his correspondence. The original arrangement of the Leon Festinger collection has largely been maintained. The collection is divided into three series: Early Writing and Research (1939-1957); Alphabetical Files (1950-1989); and Reprint File (1940-1986).</p>

          <p>Perhaps the best overview of Festinger's career can be obtained from the folder "Leon Festinger: personal histories and obituaries" which assembles background information on Festinger's life at the beginning of the series Early Writing and Research (1939-1957). This series is chronologically arranged and contains his M.A. and Ph.D. theses from the University of Iowa. Several unpublished studies from the 1940s and 1950s and correspondence regarding his Ford Foundation grant which sponsored his early work on cognitive dissonance are also included. Festinger's work for the Navy during World War II on visual decision-making by aircraft pilots is reported in the file "A Test of Decision-Time: Reliability and Generality."</p>

          <p>Alphabetical Files (1950-1989) is the largest of the three series and is primarily a correspondence file although Festinger's speeches, consulting reports, and critical evaluations (of experiments, books and journal articles) are also included. Festinger worked for many years as a consultant for the Behavioral Research Service of the General Electric Company and for various branches of the military in their efforts to increase worker productivity and test for leadership skills. "The President's Science Advisory Committee" documents Festinger's work in evaluating the civil defense shelter program and in developing a national agenda for the behavioral sciences in the early 1960s under the Kennedy administration.</p>

          <p>The folder "When Prophecy Fails" contains correspondence regarding publication, copyright, and dramatic rights to the work. Festinger's defense of the research methodology used in <title render="italic">When Prophecy Fails</title> can also be found in this folder. Notes and transcribed recordings used in preparation for writing the book remain closed until 2025 (Box 4). Researchers interested in Festinger's work on early human social groups should consult the folders "Human Legacy" and "Sloan Foundation" (sponsor of the research).</p>
          <p>The Reprint File (1940-1986) contains copies of Festinger's published journal articles and chapters contributed to various edited works. A complete bibliography, which also includes references to his published monographs, may be found at the beginning of this series. Finally, a package of seven cassette tapes from a conference on early religions held in Seville, Spain in 1983 and photographs of Festinger may be found at the end of this series (see Box 5).</p>
