    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Mabel E. Rugen was born May 13, 1902, in Glenview, Illinois. After receiving her B.S. in physical education from the University of Wisconsin in 1925, she worked as a physical education teacher in the Glenview Public Schools. She then went on to New York where she earned a M.A. (1929) and a Ph.D. (1931) from New York University in physical education.</p>
      <p>Rugen first taught health, physical education and biology in the elementary and secondary schools of Kansas, New York and New Jersey. In 1930, she secured a position at the University of Michigan as Assistant Professor of Physical Education for Women. Soon after, she was promoted to Associate Professor of Physical Education and Health Coordinator for the University High School (both appointments were in the School of Education). As associate professor, Rugen taught student teachers in the directed teaching program for physical education. In 1941, she joined the faculty of the newly formed School of Public Health as Assistant Professor of Health Education, while retaining her position at the School of Education. In 1946 she was promoted to full Professor of Health Education in both the School of Education and the School of Public Health. Rugen held this joint appointment until her retirement in 1970.</p>
      <p>Rugen's primary focus during her years at the university was teaching. During her long career she taught both undergraduate and graduate students and directed many masters theses and doctoral dissertations. Rugen played an active part in the development of guidelines and requirements for both undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>
      <p>During her tenure at the university, Rugen also became actively involved with state projects that sought to monitor and improve the health of both children and adults. Her leadership in organizations such as the Michigan Joint Committee on Health Education and the Michigan Curriculum Program in the 1930s made her a nationally known figure in the field of public health. The Community Health Service Project (CHSP) (1942-1946), in which Rugen was involved from its beginning, provided instruction in health education to high school students. The CHSP sought to provide basic health skills primarily to high school women in the hopes that they might choose to become nurses.</p>
      <p>Mabel E. Rugen belonged to more than twenty local and national organizations and is the author of over ninety articles, book chapters and brochures relating to the fields of physical education and public health.</p>

      <p>The Mabel E. Rugen Papers contain a wealth of information which documents the early years of the University of Michigan's physical education program for women, professional education for teachers of physical education, and the important contributions Rugen made in a field previously dominated by men. The collection has been divided intellectually into eight main series: Correspondence, Research Papers, Health Education Projects and Studies, School of Education, School of Public Health, Course Materials, Associations, and Topical.</p>

          <p>Correspondence (1.5 linear ft.; 1930-1980) contains both personal and general correspondence relating to the multitude of people and projects with which Rugen was actively involved both within and without the University of Michigan. Correspondence relating to Rugen's appointment to Michigan in 1930 shows her enthusiasm and conviction about teaching and documents an early interest in developing a health education program at Michigan. The general correspondence sub-series includes a sampling of Rugen's correspondence with faculty, students, and organizations, which Rugen chose to combine in one alphabetical sequence. Correspondence has also been filed by the originating school, organization, etc.</p>

          <p>Health Education Projects and Studies (1.5 linear ft.; 1921-1962) contains material relating to several important projects that Rugen worked on during the 1930s-1940s. Papers documenting the Community Health Service Project, Joint Committee on Health Education and the Michigan Curriculum Study reflect the growing interest in public health due, in part, to the findings of the draft board on the poor health of soldiers examined during conscription for World War II and the shortage of nurses and doctors due to the war. Many photographs are included which document the educational classes which taught public health during the Community Health Service Project of 1942-1946. Both the Joint Committee on Health Education and the Michigan Curriculum Study were primarily concerned with formalizing public health education in Michigan. Rugen was an active member of many sub-committees of these projects which cover topics such as sex education, temperance education, and teacher education. The Michigan League for Nursing materials document a Nurse Recruitment Study for which Rugen directed the study and wrote the final report in her capacity as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Evaluation of the Committee on Careers.</p>

            <p>The Topical File subseries contains materials arranged alphabetically by department or topic. Most of this material also covers primarily the 1930s-1940s. The Physical Education materials include meeting minutes, correspondence and miscellaneous data regarding women's physical education. Materials (especially lesson plans and teaching manuals) from the University High School where Rugen directed student teachers in the teaching of physical education for both junior high and high school students document progressive teaching techniques from the 1930s.</p>

            <p>The Topical File contains material arranged by department or topic. Included are the Reports of the Health Education Program which outline the policy and program changes in public health education between 1949-1969. Other administration documents such as minutes and annual reports trace the development of the School of Public Health's Dept. of Health Education and the active role which Mabel Rugen played. Materials on the increasingly important role of field experience as part of public health education also deserve special attention.</p>

          <p>Course Materials (3 linear ft.; 1930-1969) contain syllabi, course handouts, lecture notes, final exams, quizzes and some student evaluations which highlight the importance of Rugen's forty years of teaching both public health and education students. Because of changing course numbers, this material is arranged by the course name. After the course name various course numbers are listed which reflect numbers assigned to the course by either the School of Education or the School of Public Health.</p>

          <p>Associations material (2 linear ft.; 1931-1976) is arranged alphabetically by name of association. This series shows the depth of Rugen's involvement in the field of public health. Rugen was active in more than twenty regional and national associations covering the fields of public health and physical education, her papers trace the development of some organizations (e.g. SOPHE and the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation) from their beginnings and highlight Rugen's tremendous commitment to the field of public health.</p>
