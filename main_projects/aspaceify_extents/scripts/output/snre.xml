      <p>The School of Natural Resources (SNR) was established in 1927 but forestry courses had been offered at the University of Michigan as early as 1881. It was the first university in the United States to offer regular course work in forestry. The first forestry course was given in 1881 by Professor Morgan Volney Spalding in the School of Political Science. This forestry offering lapsed after four years, however.</p>
      <p>In 1901, at the instigation of Spalding and Charles W. Garfield of Grand Rapids, the Board of Regents voted to renew the forestry program. Charles Albert Davis was appointed special instructor in forestry and courses were offered in 1902. The following year a separate Forestry Department, headed by Filibert Roth, was created in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A). The department offered a combined undergraduate and graduate program that included four years of the usual course work for the B.A. with forestry electives, and one year of graduate study.</p>
      <p>Under Roth's direction the curriculum and the faculty expanded to keep pace with developments in the forestry profession. The University of Michigan became one of the best known forestry schools. Professor Roth retired in 1923. The naming of a successor was delayed as University President Burton used the occasion of Roth's retirement to undertake a reevaluation of the forestry program.</p>
      <p>In 1926 the Regents voted approval for an expanded forestry program. This led to the creation of an independent School of Forestry and Conservation in 1927. Samuel Trask Dana was named the school's first dean. Dana immediately began to recruit new faculty and develop a more comprehensive curriculum. Enrollment, which had declined due to the uncertainty following Roth's retirement and the impact of the depression, began to grow steadily after 1931. Spurred by the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps and other government conservation activity, enrollment reached 187 full-time students in 1939/40. With the onset of World War II, the number of students dropped precipitously only to be followed by a postwar boom in enrollment.</p>
      <p>In 1949 a committee of four noted conservationists was engaged to consider a reorganization of the school in light of developments in the forestry and conservation professions. The committee report was received favorably, but Dean Dana had prepared his own more sweeping proposal for reorganization. His plan called for creation of an expanded School of Natural Resources which would offer degrees in regional planning and general conservation in addition to the traditional training programs in forestry, wood technology, wildlife management, and fisheries management.</p>
      <p>The School of Natural Resources originally had been organized into five departments: Forestry, Wood Technology, Fisheries Management, Wildlife Management, and Conservation. The first three departments were carried over from the old Department of Forestry. Fisheries Management had been located in the Zoology Department of LS&amp;A. As its work had become more applied, it was deemed appropriate to shift the fisheries program to the School of Natural Resources.</p>
      <p>The Conservation Department developed from a $100,000 grant from the Charles Lathrop Pack Foundation for the purpose of training students in the entire field of conservation. Noted ecologist Stanley A. Cain was named the first Pack Professor of Conservation in 1950. The Conservation Department offered a number of interdisciplinary programs including natural resources economics with the Economics Department and environmental planning and water resources with the School of Public Health. By the mid-1960s conservation had become the largest SNR department. To better reflect its expanded curriculum, the Conservation Department's name was changed to Resource Planning and Conservation in 1969.</p>
      <p>While the Conservation Department was growing, other departments experienced little or no growth, prompting some significant reorganization of the school. The Wood Technology Department was phased out in 1964 and its faculty transferred to Forestry. In 1965 the Fisheries and Wildlife Management Departments were administratively combined but separate curriculums were maintained.</p>
      <p>Also in 1965, SNR acquired a new department with the transfer of Landscape Architecture from the College of Architecture and Design. During this period SNR instituted a naturalist curriculum and expanded its offerings in forest recreation. The latter development resulted in the endowing of the Samuel T. Dana Professorship of Outdoor Recreation.</p>
      <p>The School of Natural Resources has also been host to several interdepartmental projects. These include the Remote Sensing of the Environment Program, the Environmental Simulation Laboratory, and the Sea Grant Program.</p>
      <p>In 1970 the university undertook a broad review of its programs relating to environmental education and the management and development of natural resources. A university-wide committee headed by Vice President Stephen Spurr recommended that the university establish a College of Environmental Studies of which SNR would be a part. The College of Environmental Studies was not established but SNR did revise its structure and curriculum along the lines recommended by the Spurr committee. The existing SNR departments were abolished and programs were to be offered in six areas: Systems Management; Fisheries, Forestry, and Wildlife; Resource Ecology; Resource Policy and Administration; Environmental Education; and Landscape Architecture.</p>
      <p>Over the years SNR has acquired or managed several forest properties for educational and scientific purposes. These have included the Eberwhite Woods in west Ann Arbor, the Saginaw Forest property further west of Ann Arbor on Liberty Road, the Stinchfield Woods property near Dexter, the Ringwood tract near Saginaw, and Camp Filibert Roth in Iron County.</p>
      <p>As noted above, Samuel Trask Dana was named the first dean of SNR in 1927. He guided the school for twenty-three years until his retirement in 1950. He remained an active presence in the school as emeritus dean. Dana selected his own successor, Stanley G. Fontanna. Formerly deputy director of the State of Michigan Department of Conservation, Fontanna held the deanship from 1951 to 1962. He was succeeded by Stephen H. Spurr, professor of silviculture. Spurr served through 1965 when he was appointed dean of the university's Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies.</p>
      <p>Kenneth P. Davis, professor of forest management, was appointed interim dean for 1965/66. Dr. Keith Arnold of the U.S. Forest Service served as dean for three years, 1967-1969. Arnold was succeeded by James T. McFadden, chairman of the school's Department of Fisheries and Wildlife Management. McFadden was the first non-forester to be named dean and served as dean until 1974.</p>
      <p>William J. Johnson, chairman of the school's Landscape Architecture program, was selected to succeed McFadden. When Johnson stepped down as dean in 1983 to return to academics, he was succeeded by James E. Crowfoot. Confronted with budget reductions and a review by the University of Michigan, Crowfoot provided SNR with the necessary leadership during an intense period of scrutiny. Crowfoot stepped down as dean in December 1990 to chair the Resource, Policy and Behavior concentration and left the University of Michigan in 1994 to assume the presidency of Antioch College. In addition to his responsibilities as dean, Crowfoot was co-founder of the Program in Conflict Management Alternatives. An advocate of the democratic management of organizations, he developed a new curriculum emphasis in environmental dispute resolution.</p>
      <p>Following Crowfoot's resignation Harrison Morton was appointed interim dean of the school until the appointment of Garry D. Brewer in 1992. Among Brewer's first achievements was implementing a name change for the School of Natural Resources. During the July 1992 meeting the University of Michigan Board of Regents approved a name change to the School of Natural Resources and Environment (SNRE). The name changes was designed to reflect the expanding scope of the school. Brewer left the deanship in 1995 and Paul Webb was appointed interim dean. Daniel A. Mazmanian, was appointed dean in June 1996.</p>

          <p>The General Topical Files series consists for the most part of historical files covering a range of topics. The series is composed of two subseries reflecting separate, but chronologically overlapping alphabetically arranged files. Of special interest is the correspondence with alumni serving in World War II ("Alumni in WW II, Correspondence from and Newspaper Clippings about"), and Dean Dana's correspondence with various people regarding the history of the lumber industry in Michigan and lumberjack lore ("History of Lumber Industry in Michigan"). Also included in this small series are historical statistics regarding curriculum offerings, degrees conferred, and student dissertation topics.</p>

            <p>The 1928-1990 subseries of the General Topical Files (6.2 linear ft., received in the 1989-1991 accessions) primarily address issues internal to the School of Natural Resources. Numerous committees and task forces are represented in this series, among them the Academic Affairs Committee and the Promotion and Tenure Committee. Topics relating to academic endeavors and curriculum development include "Problem Centered Laboratory Network (PCLN)" and "Specialization Coordinators." Other significant material in this series are the papers of former faculty member Dow V. Baxter (under "Faculty"), materials dating from the 1940s to the 1980s about land owned and/or utilized by the school ("Properties of SNR" also see Box 54 for additional material on SNR properties), and a review of the Wildland Management Center. The folders "Goals and Objectives" provide insight on the school's future direction.</p>

          <p>The Programs and Departments series (3.2 linear ft.) includes records from 1939 to 1984 on SNR programs and departments. Types of materials found here include meeting minutes, committee reports, and correspondence and memoranda. Strongly documented are the Great Lakes and Marine Water Center and the Landscape Architecture Program. The Great Lakes and Marine Water Center is a university unit funded in part by SNR and in which SNR has administrative involvement. The Landscape Architecture Program is offered by SNR in conjunction with the College of Architecture and Urban Planning, and much of the material relates to the development of the program and its direction.</p>

          <p>The School Reviews series (3 linear ft.) is arranged chronologically by date of review and includes materials from school-wide reviews in 1967, 1970, 1976-1978, and 1982-1984. The majority of the series is comprised of materials from the 1982-1984 Review. The 1982-1984 Review was critical for SNR. It was initiated by the University's Budget Priorities Committee, which formed a Review Sub-Committee to evaluate SNR programs in terms of (1) quality and rigor, (2) cost and comparative productivity, and (3) importance or priority of the school in the university's overall mission. The sub-committee was further asked to determine whether the university should consider the discontinuance of SNR. The original arrangement of these materials as received from SNR has been retained, and consists of chronological folders, files of questions from the review committee, reports, and topical files. In response to the intense scrutiny SNR developed its own Development Plan Task Force and Transition Team in 1983 for the purposes of examining all functions of SNR, including curricula, faculty research and contributions, and SNR structure and governance.</p>

          <p>The Dean's Topical Files, 1967-1990 series consists of the central files maintained in the office of the dean. Activities and functions documented here include those within SNR, communications and cooperative efforts with other university units, and involvement with external organizations. The Topical Files are divided into subseries reflecting the various accession in which materials were received from the school. The subseries, identified by the date range of the materials, are arranged alphabetically. The subject headings frequently continue from one subseries to the next.</p>

            <p>The 1977-1990 subseries of the Dean's Topical Files (8.5 linear ft., received in the 1989-1991 accessions) spans the years 1977 to 1990 and consists of the central files maintained in the office of the dean. It includes files form the tenures of deans William H. Johnson and James Crowfoot. The responsibilities of the dean are broad, ranging from SNR administrative and curricular issues, to communication and cooperative efforts with other university units, to interactions with professional organizations. Also documented here are the school's contributions to professional development ("International Seminars"). Documentation of SNR internal activities in this subseries is strong and can be found under such folder headings as "Administrative Team Retreats," "Courses and Curricula," "Faculty," "Masters Projects," and "Specialization Coordinators." Examples of SNR's cooperation with other university units include "Extension Service," "Continuing Education/ Midcareer Programs," and "Joint Programs and Interunit Initiatives." Both the Wildland Management Center and the Meeman Archive are well-documented.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series is comprised of two subseries: Photographs and Glass Slides of Michigan. The Photographs subseries includes one linear foot of photographs, an outsize folder, and one photograph album. All photographs are black and white and range in dates from 1904 to 1964. The photographs are separated into the categories School of Natural Resources, Michigan, and Other States. SNR subjects include faculty, student class photographs, and Forestry Club activities and group photos. As the student Forestry Club seems to have been a general club for all SNR students, for years which a class photograph does not exist the researcher is advised to examine the Forestry Club photos. The photographs of Michigan are arranged alphabetically by subject and consist mostly of scenes of wooded areas, logging activities, and lumber companies. In addition, there are two photos of Rock Harbor Lighthouse. The group of photographs from Other States are also arranged alphabetically by subject, which include fire fighters, forest fires, forest rangers, and logging and lumber companies. Additional photographs and negatives received in the 1995 accession are housed here and are described in the inventory.</p>
          <p>The four small boxes of Glass Slides of Michigan (1 linear foot) are divided into three geographic regions: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower Michigan, and Southern Lower Michigan. Dates are provided in the box list where available and seem to range from roughly 1910 to 1940. Subjects with the most slides include Isle Royale (1936 fire), Pictured Rocks, Belle Isle, Clinton River, Cranbrook Institute, Woodlawn Cemetery, Hartland, various Ann Arbor scenes, Huron River, and a number of Michigan state parks.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The series Department of Landscape Architecture is comprised of two subseries: Alumni Correspondence and Other Correspondence. The former includes a collection of correspondence between students and alumni of the Department and two professors, Aubrey Tealdi and H.O. Whittemore. The correspondence spans 1917 to 1960, with the bulk of the correspondence occurring between 1930 and 1955. The majority of the correspondence is with Professor Whittemore. It is arranged in reverse chronological order by the alumni's last name. The first set of folders include, correspondence with alumni, from which only one letter was received; this follows the arrangement of the original owners, Tealdi and Whittemore. The correspondence ranges from suggestions of possible employment openings to retirement congratulations to past students. It also includes discussion of work and theory as well as general status updates. The breadth of time covered by some correspondence is impressive, in some cases the alumni corresponded with their professors over a twenty to thirty-year period. This information can act as an informal longitudinal survey of the activities of Department alumni. It is especially interesting to learn about the work available to women alumnae, to follow the progression of careers during the Depression, World War II, and the post-War era, as well as to note the different positions taken by alumni all over the country. Among the correspondents are alumni who worked on government projects, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, and others who went on to become respected landscape architecture faculty at other institutions.</p>
          <p>The small sub-series of Other Correspondence includes letters from Professor Tealdi regarding the administration of the Nichols Arboretum, and letters to Professor Whittemore from prospective students requesting information about the Department and about the field of landscape architecture, along with his responses.</p>
