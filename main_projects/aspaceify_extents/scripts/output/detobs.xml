      <abstract>The Detroit Observatory, an astronomical observatory on the campus of the University of Michigan, was the vision of University of Michigan President Henry Philip Tappan. He recognized the need for institutions of higher education to pursue scientific endeavors. Built in 1854, the Detroit Observatory was named after the Detroit residents who helped finance the building project. Extensive restoration work of the Observatory was completed in 1999.</abstract>

      <p>In his inaugural speech of 1852, University of Michigan President Henry Philip Tappan stressed the need for institutions of higher education in America to pursue scientific endeavors in order to keep up with their European counterparts. Inspired by his speech, Detroit lawyer and former railroad businessman, Henry N. Walker approached Tappan, offering to help finance the construction of an astronomical observatory at the University of Michigan. Walker was able to secure funds from business acquaintances and friends, primarily Detroit residents. In 1854, an Observatory was constructed on the University of Michigan campus and named the Detroit Observatory in tribute to these Detroit benefactors. (For a detailed and rich account of the early history of the Detroit Observatory, researchers should consult the book of former Observatory director Patricia S. Whitesell entitled <title render="italic">A Creation of His Own: Tappan's Detroit Observatory</title>, 1998).</p>
      <p>The Observatory flourished through the early twentieth century, enabling the construction of several additions to the original structure, including a director's residence and classroom and office spaces. During the latter half of the century, with a decline in use of the instruments and space along with the erection of new university buildings, these additions were demolished. Today, only the 1854 structure remains.</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Observatory was mainly abandoned and the university proposed to demolish the building. A group of concerned citizens saved the building from destruction, and in 1973, the Detroit Observatory was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Although the building was saved from destruction, the Observatory was in need of extensive restoration work. In 1994, the Office of the Vice President for Research and the History and Traditions Committee submitted a proposal to the University to restore the 1854 structure. Transferred to the new direction of the Office of the Vice President for Research, the Observatory was able to secure the necessary funds for restoration. From 1994 to 1999, the Detroit Observatory was significantly restored, from the restoration of the domes, telescopes, and interior furnishings to the addition of a bathroom and handicap accessible entrances and walkways. Under the new leadership of Patricia S. Whitesell, the Detroit Observatory opened its doors to the public, offering public tours (but no astronomic viewing program or other use of the historic telescopes), a lecture series, as well as many additional educational outreach activities. In 2005, the oversight of the Observatory was transferred to the Bentley Historical Library.</p>

        <emph render="bold">History of the Name</emph>
      </p>
      <p>When the Observatory was constructed in 1854, it was named the Detroit Observatory to recognize the Detroit citizens who had donated funds for its construction. In 1931, the name was changed to the Observatory (Observatories) of the University of Michigan (Regents Proceedings, November 1931, p.809). In 1999, the identity was changed to the University of Michigan Detroit Observatory in tribute to the original name (Regents Proceedings, May 1999, p.335).</p>

      <p>The Detroit Observatory record group includes administrative materials of the Observatory's later years (post-1994), including documentation on the Observatory's restoration project and materials encompassing the Observatory's publicity and outreach efforts. The collection also contains various historical documents and artifacts such as logbooks and records, photographs and other visual materials, motion pictures, architectural drawings, and publications. The collection includes all of the documents, artifacts, and records transferred to the Bentley Historical Library in 2005. Materials not physically transferred to the Bentley that remain in the Observatory (such as telescopes, clocks, and associated astronomical devices) have not been identified here, but documentation can be found listed in the various inventories and databases found in the administrative series.</p>
      <p>This collection contains the following series: Administrative, Publicity and Outreach, Research, Historical, and Publications.</p>

          <p>The Administrative series (1994-2004, 5 linear feet) includes materials relating to the operation and functioning of the Detroit Observatory since 1994. This series includes an extensive inventory of photographs and descriptive records of the over three-hundred Detroit Observatory holdings; these are scientific instruments, historical photographs, publications, logbooks, and other miscellaneous artifacts and materials. The administrative series also includes correspondence, budget and fundraising documentation, meeting minutes, and materials documenting the day-to-day operation of the Observatory. A substantial portion of this series concerns the planning and implementation of the extensive restoration of the Observatory. For administrative materials prior to 1994, researchers should consult other Bentley collections, including the University of Michigan Observatory record group. The Observatory record group contains administrative material on the Detroit Observatory, including inventories, budgets, personnel, and account books from approximately 1908 to 1948.</p>

          <p>The Historical series (1860-2004, 14 linear ft.) consists of data, audiovisual materials, artifacts, and other collected records documenting the many uses and functions of the Observatory throughout its history. The series includes records of observations and research activities conducted at the Detroit Observatory as well as some observational data from as early as 1800. Some of these records were apparently held by the university Department of Astronomy, individual faculty members and private collectors. When the Observatory was reopened for educational and public programming activities in the 1990s, director Sandy Whitesell began acquiring historical records of the observatory. The Historical series has been organized by material type into three subseries: Records and Observational Data, Audiovisual Materials, and Artifacts.</p>

            <p>The Records and Observational Data subseries consists of various sets of weather-related records and observational data recorded at the Observatory. Sets of anemometer (wind pressure), barograph (atmospheric pressure), and thermograph (temperature) records exist from the 1880s to the early 1900s. A set of logbooks that record various observations at the Observatory and data recorded from the Meridian Circle telescope are also part of this series. <title render="italic">Other observation notebooks can be found in the University of Michigan Observatory record group</title> in the Detroit Observatory subseries and the Observation charts and notebooks series.</p>
