    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Alexander Eckstein, born December 9, 1915 in Novisad, Yugoslavia, came to the United States as a student in 1936. In 1939, he received his B. S. from the University of California at Berkeley in plant science. He continued his graduate work at Berkeley, studying agricultural economics, and earning his M. S. in 1941 and his Ph.D. in 1952.</p>
      <p>On December 6, 1943 Alexander Eckstein became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He served overseas in the U. S. Army from 1943 to 1946, interrogating German prisoners and analyzing captured documents. After the War, Eckstein married Ruth Rubinstein (February 21, 1947).</p>
      <p>From 1946 until 1949, Eckstein worked as an economist for the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. At the same time, he worked on finishing his dissertation, "The Economic Development of Hungary, 1920 to 1950: A Study in the Growth of an Economically Underdeveloped Area." During 1949-1950, he was appointed Area Research Fellow for the Social Science Research Council, and from 1951-1953, he worked as a senior economist for the Department of State.</p>
      <p>In 1953, Eckstein was a lecturer and research associate at Harvard's Russian Research Center. Though he then specialized in comparative economic studies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, Eckstein was also becoming increasingly involved in Chinese studies in 1956, be became a lecturer and research associate in the Department of Economics at Harvard, while he plunged into studying China and the Chinese economy. In 1959 he went to Formosa (Taiwan) to Put the finishing touches on his command of the Chinese language.</p>
      <p>Upon his return to the United States, Eckstein was named the Haloid-Xerox Professor of International Economics at the University of Rochester. He taught in this position until 1961, when he came to the University of Michigan as a Professor of Economics. He remained at the University of Michigan until his death in 1976. During this period, Eckstein was simultaneously a consultant to the Department of State (1962-1976), Director of the Center for Chinese Studies (1967-1969) and Director of the Chinese Economic Studies project (1975-1976).</p>
      <p>Eckstein included among his professional and honorary society memberships the American Economic Association, the Association for Asian Studies (Director, 1961/62 - 1963/64; Program Chairman, 1964; Member of Executive Group, Committee on American Library Resources on the Far East, 1963-1964), the Association for Comparative Economics, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Economic History Association and the Economic History Society. He was also active in a number of national organizations, most notably the National Committee on United States-China Relations (NCUSCR). From 1966 to 1976 he was a member and a Board member of the Executive Committee of the NCUSCR. He was Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, in 1968-1969, and Chairman from 1970 to 1972. Eckstein was on the Editorial Board of the magazines World Politics and The China Quarterly. He was a member of the Academic Advisory Board for the National Council for United States-China Trade.</p>
      <p>During the last ten years of his life, Eckstein was a part of the Committee on Scholarly Exchanges with the People's Republic of China. For the Social Science Research Council, he served with the Joint Committee for the Study of Contemporary China (also sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies), 1959-1966, and the Committee on the Economy of china, 1961-1969. His other affiliations included the Visiting Committees for the Brookings Institution and Harvard University, the International Committee for Chinese Studies, the Association for the Study of Soviet-Type Economies, and the Association for Comparative Economic Studies (of which he was the President in 1974).</p>
      <p>In addition to this multitude of professional activity, Eckstein was a prolific author. His own books include <title render="italic">The National Income of China</title> (1961), <title render="italic">Communist China's Economic Growth and Foreign Trade</title> (1966), <title render="italic">China's Economic Development: The Interplay of Scarcity and Ideology</title> (1975), and <title render="italic">China's Economic Revolution</title> (1977, published posthumously). He co-authored two books - Prospects for Communist China (1954, with W. W. Hatch, J. R. Kierman, and W. W. Rostow) and Moscow-Peking Axis (1957, with Boorman, Mosely and Schwartz). He was the editor of <title render="italic">Economic Trends in Communist China</title> (1968, with Walter Galenson and T. C. Liu), <title render="italic">Comparison of Economic Systems: Theoretical and Methodological Approaches</title> (1971), <title render="italic">China Trade Prospects and U. S. Policy</title> (1971) and <title render="italic">Quantitative Measures of China's Economic Output</title> (1980, published posthumously). He also wrote numerous articles.</p>
      <p>Since he believed that Communist China would become a permanent and powerful nation-state on the world scene, Eckstein was an advocate of initiating more cordial relations with the People's Republic of China from an early date. Through his involvement in the NCUSCR, Eckstein played an important role in arranging the visit of the Chinese Table Tennis Team which cleared the way for Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon's historic flights to Peking in 1972. Once the first contact had been established, he continued to work for expanded exchanges between the United States and China, not only in athletics, but also in trade, and scholarly and cultural matters.</p>
      <p>Having witnessed the disruption of Chinese studies in the United States during the McCarthy era, Eckstein was concerned about educating a new generation of China scholars. This was the motivation behind his interest in the establishment and maintenance of centers for Chinese research, not only at the University of Michigan but at other universities as well.</p>
      <p>His work on China led Eckstein to take a public stand on the Vietnam War. Although he was by no means a dove, he was an outspoken critic of President Johnson's Vietnam policy. Together with several other Michigan professors, many of them also in the China field, Eckstein began a study group on Vietnam. On several occasions he gave testimony before different Congressional committees, and from 1966-1968, he was a member of the State Department Advisory Panel on China.</p>
      <p>As a public-spirited man, Eckstein was an active campaigner for Donald M. Riegle and Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. He took an interest in the case of Robert Williams, a Black activist accused of kidnapping a White couple. And within the University, he served as a member of the Faculty Reform Coalition, which was primarily concerned with the quality of education received by minority students at Michigan.</p>
      <p>Alexander Eckstein died of a heart attack at age sixty-one on December 5, 1976. Through his work, both academic and political, he was an influential force behind the improved relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and was a significant figure in furthering the study of China in this country.</p>

      <p>The papers of Alexander Eckstein consist of 10.3 linear feet of material. The collection most heavily documents the last twenty-five years of Eckstein's life, roughly the years 1960-1976, although there is some earlier material dating back to World War II. The papers deal almost exclusively with his professional life; there is very little of a personal nature included. Furthermore, the bulk of the collection concerns primarily his work and interest in China, although the section of his writings does contain material on Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The papers portray Eckstein the scholar rather than Eckstein the professor. For instance there are no materials relating to his term as Director of the China Center at the University of Michigan or to the Chinese Economic Studies project which he directed. The collection is divided into the following major series: Personal, China, Personal Correspondence, Talks, Trips, University of Michigan, Vietnam, Writings, Sound Recordings, and Photographs.</p>

          <p>The section China is the largest series within the collection. Here Eckstein filed the records documenting his involvement with China-related organizations (notably NCUSCR and the SSRC). In addition, this series includes files relating to the opening of relations with China -- Congressional testimony, statements on U. S. - China policy, and papers pertaining to various conferences and seminars. Eckstein's role in the opening of relations with the People's Republic of China will be of interest to the student of Chinese and American diplomacy, or political science. Furthermore, anyone interested in the role of American "China Watchers" or more generally in the influence of academics upon government policy will find these papers helpful. Regarding China specifically, most of Eckstein's work on the Chinese economy has been published. The collection does contain, however, substantial amounts of data collected by him. Of particular note is the computer printout "Commodity Composite of the Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China with the Free World and the USSR, 1955 - 1973," (box 11).</p>

          <p>Eckstein arranged his Personal Correspondence alphabetically. The names of some of his correspondents include several top American-Chins, scholars, such as Doak Barnett, John King Fairbank, Edgar Snow, and Allen Whiting. There is also a file for Henry Kissinger. These files also contain non-correspondence, such as clippings or reprints. In addition, the researcher should note the filing of correspondence throughout the China series, especially under the names of organizations.</p>

          <p>Eckstein took a number of trips during his career. These were primarily research-oriented rather than for pleasure. His notes from these trips contain economic data collected during his visits. The Trips series also includes material concerning Eckstein's planning for the trips, correspondence with government officials and academics, schedules for speeches Eckstein would give while abroad, tours of industrial sites and meetings with representatives of economic agencies. Most of Eckstein's trips were to the Far East, but he also visited Australia, India, and Yugoslavia. Since his data was gathered first-hand, this section could be of use to anyone interested in the economies of the countries he toured.</p>

          <p>The section on the University of Michigan is somewhat disappointing, since it does not reflect many of Eckstein's activities at that institution. One very obvious lack is the complete absence of any material relating to his work as the Director of the China Center. Most of this section is concerned with Eckstein's part in the Faculty Reform Coalition (1970-1971), particularly the Council on Minority Affairs, the Opportunity Program and the University Judiciary. There are also files concerning the Walgreen Chair appointment, the Chabad House Project, University news releases, letters of recommendation, and various other matters. Most of the material covers the time span 1965-1971.</p>

          <p>Eckstein's interest in Vietnam grew out of his work on China, especially since American policy in Vietnam was so closely tied to the existing China policy. Thus the series Vietnam contains policy statement (by Eckstein and others who formed a Vietnam Study Group), Study Group minutes, correspondence with Representative Donald Riegle (Dem.-Michigan) material from a Congressional Briefing Session, and two folders of collected information on Vietnam.</p>

          <p>The second largest series, after China, is Writings. The files include drafts, reprints, reviews, research notes and correspondence relating to the publication of Eckstein's various works. The bulk of the writings concerns China and the Chinese economy, but some of his earlier studies on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are included. Much of Eckstein's data on the economy of Eastern Europe was gathered immediately after the end of World War II and may be valuable in its own right. This material could be useful in a comparative study of either developing countries or of Socialist and mixed economies.</p>
