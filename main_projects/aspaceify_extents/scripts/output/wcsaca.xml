      <p>The history of substance abuse coordination by the Washtenaw County Community Mental Health Center (WCCMHC) dates back to 1970 when the center received a mandate from the state to provide a coordination effort in drug programming for Washtenaw County. In 1971 the Office of Drug Program Coordination (ODPC) was established by the Center and the first Comprehensive Drug Plan for Washtenaw County was drafted.</p>
      <p>Coordination of substance abuse services received its current legislative mandate by Public Act 56 (PA 56) of the Michigan Public Health Acts of 1973. Prior to this time, agencies were classified as dealing with either alcohol or drug problems. PA 56 combined all of these agencies into one coordination system under the direction of the Office of Substance Abuse Services (OSAS). The Washtenaw County Community Mental Health Services Board (WCCMHSB) was initially designated the Substance Abuse Coordinating Agency for the county by the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners in 1974, as authorized under PA 56. The redesignation of ODPC as the Office of Substance Abuse Coordination reflects the increased responsibilities under PA 56.</p>
      <p>WCCMHC serves the following functions in order to fulfill the responsibilities of substance abuse coordination:</p>
      <list type="simple">
        <item>Development of a comprehensive county plan for substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention services.</item>
        <item>Collection and transfer of data from local licensed agencies.</item>
        <item>Preparation and submission of an annual budget request for the allocation of state-administered substance abuse program funds.</item>
        <item>Establishment of subcontracts with local agencies to provide direct services.</item>
        <item>Regular evaluation of substance abuse services in the county.</item>
        <item>Provision of technical assistance to local substance abuse service organizations.</item>
      </list>
      <p>These functions allow the Coordinating Agency to exert considerable control over county-wide priorities and budgets and some control over programming and policies by virtue of its role in the licensing process.</p>
      <p>Community input regarding drug issues and services was provided through the Drug Advisory Council until 1975, when the council was reconstituted as the Substance Abuse Advisory Council (SAAC) in keeping with its new role under PA 56. The twenty-five citizen members provide community input directly to WCCMHSB by their review of the annual "Comprehensive Plan", and comments on substance abuse issues and the effectiveness of services.</p>
      <p>In 1976 the Michigan Department of Public Health, in an effort to eliminate duplication and high administrative costs, consolidated the Livingston and Washtenaw County Coordinating Agencies. The consolidated Livingston-Washtenaw Substance Abuse Coordinating Agency is governed solely by the WCCMHSB. Input, direction and guidance are provided by the Bi-County SAAC, and by licensed substance abuse programs, local municipalities, and the general public. A forum is made available at regular Board meetings as well as regular meetings of the Advisory Council for input from all of the above-named groups.</p>

      <p>The Washtenaw County Community Mental Health Center Substance Abuse Coordinating Agency (SACA) record group consists of materials from 1970 to 1988 which document the coordination of substance abuse prevention and treatment efforts in Washtenaw and Livingston counties. Overall strengths of the collection include materials which document the agency's approaches to management, credentialing, and funding, and the records of the Michigan Association of Substance Abuse Coordinators, a statewide network of coordinating agency administrators.</p>
      <p>This record group can be studied to gain insight into the actual processes involved in coordinating a variety of local service provider agencies by SACA, which is in the middle echelon of the state substance abuse hierarchy. The researcher can also gain an understanding of how, and what types of information flow up and down that hierarchy. Agency functions, as listed previously in the History section, which are well documented are the development of comprehensive plans, review of license applications, and the preparation of annual budget requests.</p>
      <p>This agency is the focal point for the allocation of federal and state funds for substance abuse in Washtenaw and Livingston Counties. The researcher can gain an understanding of the myriad types of substance abuse services local agencies provide, including prevention, casefinding, emergency care, intermediate care, inpatient care, outpatient care and rehabilitative/supportive care.</p>
      <p>The record group consists of folders arranged alphabetically within four series. The Administrative Files and Agencies and Programs series have been maintained in their original order, while the Professional and Citizen Advocacy Groups and Topical Files series are artificial groupings created to facilitate order and access to the records.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Files series (8 linear feet) consists of materials, 1970-1988, that directly relate to the coordination of substance abuse prevention and treatment programs. Included are annual reports, correspondence, plans, contracts, budgets, directories of agencies, proposals, and reports.</p>
          <p>The researcher can get a basic introduction to the complex state substance abuse network by starting with the "History - Substance Abuse Coordination" folder in box one. An overview of how SACA operates can be discerned by reviewing the Comprehensive Plans and Annual Action Plans. The Comprehensive Plans, which end in 1978, document the early operations of the coordinating agency and contain budget summaries, definitions and provider agency information broken down by the type of service provided: prevention, casefinding or treatment. The Annual Action Plans follow chronologically after the Comprehensive Plans and, with the exception of fiscal year 1985/86, there is a complete run of these documents through 1987. Information in the annual plans is organized by agency names and gives an excellent overview of budgets, funding priorities and funded agencies.</p>
          <p>The most important function of the coordinating agency is its role in the funding process. The "funding" folders contain reports, proposals, correspondence, minutes, personal notes and statistics. These materials illustrate funding patterns and guidelines, as well as the actual process of making funding decisions.</p>
          <p>The researcher can investigate attempts to develop effective management techniques used in coordinating activities by examining the Integrated Substance Abuse Management Information System (ISAMIS), Management Information System (MIS), and Data Compact materials. ISAMIS was the first attempt by OSAS to develop a standardized statewide information system. Due to deficiencies perceived in the ISAMIS system, a Coordinating Agency Consortium was formed in 1977 to develop a more efficient system. This group eventually evolved into the Southeastern Michigan Data Compact, which became the basis for a statewide substance abuse database. The folders labeled "Documentation Flow Charts and Forms" in the MIS materials provide the researcher with insight into the nature of client documentation at various agencies. This information was used in a MIS revision and includes the types of data collected, how the paperwork flows through the pertinent organizations and time estimates for the various processes.</p>
          <p>The credentialing of substance abuse professionals in Michigan can be studied by referring to the "credentialing" folders. Materials relate to the development of the Apprentice Counselor Credential of the OSAS which began in December 1982 and the merging of this system with the existent Michigan Certification Board for Addiction Specialists system in 1984. The goals of credentialing are to assure minimum levels of knowledge among direct service staff and to recognize high levels of competency among counselors so that they can compete professionally with "degreed" individuals.</p>
          <p>The PA 339 materials illustrate the response of the substance abuse network to a piece of high impact legislation, in this case the Substance Abuse Assistance Act (Decriminalization of Public Intoxication). The researcher can trace the history of the committees which were formed and the procedures developed to effect a smooth transition to the new system.</p>
          <p>The complex issues involved in determining the degree of success treatment has achieved can be investigated in the Treatment Outcome Project folders, which contain reports, memos, correspondence, surveys, minutes, and a dissertation on factors in successful treatment. The focus of the project shifted away from determining client satisfaction to outcome assessment. Demand for data on the effectiveness of programs has arisen from consumer groups, legislators, insurance companies, and other funding sources. Resulting information has been used to monitor client outcome, assess program effectiveness, and as an aid in program planning.</p>

          <p>The Agencies and Programs series (7 linear feet) contains materials from 1971 to 1988 which document the interaction of the Coordinating Agency with direct care substance abuse service providers within Livingston and Washtenaw counties. These materials are arranged alphabetically by program title and the majority of the records pertain to funded programs, and primarily consist of contracts and budgets, correspondence, licensing documents and review/audit records. Reports, manuals, plans and resource guides are also present in this series. The Ann Arbor Community Center, Child and Family Services, and the Washtenaw Council on Alcoholism are agencies about which there is fairly comprehensive documentation.</p>
          <p>The history of heroin treatment in Washtenaw County is illustrated through the records of three programs: Octagon House, the Community Mental Health Treatment Facility (CMHTF), and the Child and Family Services Drug Treatment Program. The Octagon House program began in 1971 supported by funding from a Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) Grant. Octagon House became independent of the Mental Health Center in 1975 since the provisions of PA 56 require that an organization either serve a coordination function or provide direct services. A series of problems developed at the House including; noncompliance with state and federal regulations, financial irregularities, conflict of interest, and falsification of client records. These problems led to the closing of Octagon House and a waiver of the restrictions of PA 56 so that the coordinating agency could provide services to former clients of the House. Treatment was provided by the CMHTF program under the direction of SACA from July 1979 until April 1980, at which time Child and Family Services (CFS) was determined to be appropriate to administer the program. In June 1982 CFS renamed the program the Child and Family Services Drug Treatment Program.</p>

            <p>The Michigan Association of Substance Abuse Coordinators, Inc. (MASAC) constitutes the most significant and comprehensive records of this series. MASAC was established in 1975 as a professional association representing state-funded substance abuse program delivery coordinators from all counties in Michigan. The goal of the organization is to bring regional agency directors together in order to better provide consistent and effective substance abuse prevention, casefinding, treatment, and data collection services. The organization became a registered lobbyist in 1984 and has had substantial impact on the legislative process by interpreting substance abuse needs to the governor, the legislature and OSAS. MASAC also disseminates information on state policies and professional standards to its membership.</p>
