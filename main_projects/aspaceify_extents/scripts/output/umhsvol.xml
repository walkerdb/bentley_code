      <abstract>Volunteer service unit established at the University of Michigan Hospital in 1941.

The materials in the University of Michigan Health Systems Volunteer Services collection contain information on the service beginning with its formal establishment in 1941. Items include topical files, photographs, and audiovisual materials covering programming, volunteer recruitment, and especially volunteer recognition.</abstract>

      <p>On January 3, 1941, Hospital Director Harley Haynes proposed the establishment of a volunteer service at the University Michigan Hospital. The proposal was well received and Kathryn Walsh, former clerical supervisor of out-patient clinics, was appointed as director. Walsh visited the volunteer departments in hospitals located in Detroit, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio to gather information about establishing a similar program at the University Hospital.</p>
      <p>Having gathered ideas for the structure of the program, its duties, and its uniforms, Miss Walsh visited area ladies and church organizations in Ann Arbor to recruit volunteers. March 31, 1941, marked the first official day of active Volunteer Services. These early volunteers served as receptionists in the Registration Department. They greeted patients, took registration cards, and served as hospital guides. By May 1941, nine active volunteers had given 85 hours of volunteer time. Volunteers were often young housewives or single young women who were not employed full-time. New volunteers were recruited through newspaper articles, letters of invitation, and informational teas.</p>
      <p>By June 1941, participation more than doubled with 21 active volunteers giving a combined 100 hours a week. Volunteers were now serving in the surgery and medical clinics. The first University of Michigan students to participate joined in October 1941. In March 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, the Volunteer Services registered with the Civilian Defense Volunteer Office. The hospital faced a staffing crisis as orderlies, ward helpers, and others left to join the armed services. Volunteers from the community and students from the university stepped forward. In April 1942, at the service's one-year anniversary, there were 74 active volunteers who had given a combined total of 4,033 hours.</p>
      <p>The Volunteer Services branched into more of the hospital's departments. Volunteers worked in the patient's library, delivered food trays, read to patients, wrote letters, ran errands, answered phones, and served as guides to the hospital. With an eye toward expanding volunteer services, the department established a cart service in December 1943 to take candy, cigarettes, tobacco, and magazines around to the wards. This saved the nurses aides from having to run down to shop for patients.</p>
      <p>In 1954, Volunteer Services began recognizing their volunteers with an annual recognition ceremony. The tradition has continued to present with volunteers being recognized for years of service. On November 2, 1959, Volunteer Services opened the Guild Gift Shop at the hospital. The gift shop was financed through fund raising and fund matching.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Volunteer Services has grown from its original home in the "Old Main" Hospital to serve in the Taubman Medical Center, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, the Women's Hospital and additional medical centers in Ann Arbor. Volunteers have served in many capacities at the hospital in programs like Adopt-a-Room, Thera-paws, and Parent-to-Parent Support, among others. The programs have extended beyond the hospital to include Meals on Wheels and other community outreach opportunities.

      <p>The University of Michigan Health System Volunteer Services collection covers the years from 1937 to 2005. The majority of the material covers the years 1979-2000. The records include some history and establishment information, but a majority of the information deals with the annual volunteer recognition program. There is also a significant amount of photographs, including photographs of individuals volunteering as well as photographs from the annual volunteer recognition program. The collection has been organized into five series: Topical Files, Publications, Volunteer Recognition, Audio-Visual Materials, and Ephemera.</p>

          <p>The Audio-Visual Materials series (1940s-2005) is arranged alphabetically by categories and subjects. Many of the earlier photographs appear to be copy prints. There are three sub-series: Mounted Photographs, Photographs, and Videocassettes. Photographs make up a majority of the series. Of these photographs, many are of volunteers in the hospital volunteering or of the Volunteer Services recognition programs. Also included is a slideshow for recruiting volunteers, several CD-ROMs containing digital photographs, and videocassette tapes with photograph shows presented at the annual volunteer recognition program.</p>
