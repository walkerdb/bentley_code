      <p>The University Musical Society was organized in 1879 by members of the university faculty called together by University President Henry S. Frieze. In 1881 it was incorporated as a nonprofit educational corporation. The society twice extended its corporate existence. In 1969 it was reincorporated "in perpetuity."</p>
      <p>The society states that its purpose is to, in part, "cultivate the public taste for music and afford opportunities for the acquisition of musical knowledge and skill..." Affiliated with it, but technically governed by separate boards, were the Choral Union, the University Orchestra and the Ann Arbor School of Music. Despite their technical independence, in reality interlocking directorships led to a situation in which members of the UMS Board of Directors administered the various subordinate units.</p>
      <p>In 1892 this situation was formally recognized. The independent governing boards of the Choral Union, Orchestra, and School of Music were disbanded and all three institutions came directly under the jurisdiction of the UMS directors. The school's name was changed to the University School of Music, and funds were raised for the construction of a building for the school.</p>
      <p>The Choral Union itself was an outgrowth of the Messiah Club and consisted of singers from several Ann Arbor churches as well as the university community. This organization has continued its traditional Messiah performances as well as participation in May Festival concerts.</p>
      <p>In 1893 it was proposed that the society's concert series close with a festival of three concerts rather than with a single event as had been the custom. The three-day event was a great success and, in 1894, the May Festival became an annual occurrence.</p>
      <p>While always closely associated with the university, the UMS was and remains technically independent from the control of the Board of Regents. Generally satisfactory, this situation proved troublesome regarding musical education. In 1905 the Regents authorized Michigan students to perform accredited studies at the UMS-governed University School of Music. In 1929 the regents and UMS agreed that the University School of Music should become a component part of the University of Michigan, however the school would continue to be administratively under the control of the UMS Board of Directors whose decisions would be subject to the approval of the regents.</p>
      <p>In 1940 the University Musical Society relinquished all rights and responsibilities regarding the School of Music to the regents of the University of Michigan who agreed to assume full responsibility for the school's operation. This separation was both legal and physical as the society left its offices in the School of Music to occupy offices on the first floor of Burton Memorial Tower.</p>
      <p>The Choral Union Series, begun in 1889, has served as the major series of concerts presented by the UMS. Presentations have included major orchestras and artists from around the world. The Philadelphia Orchestra began a tenure with the May Festival in 1936, an association which lasted until 1984. Interest in presenting an expanded base of concerts led to the establishment of the Chamber Arts Series in 1963 which focused on chamber music. A Summer Concert Series took place from 1964 to 1971.</p>
      <p>In 1960 the University Musical Society recommended changes to Hill Auditorium to allow for an orchestra pit and proscenium which would make possible the introduction of ethnic folk dance, ballet and opera presentations as well. These performances also took place in Rackham Auditorium and, beginning in 1971, the Power Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
      <p>In addition to the above series, the University Musical Society also sponsors special (non-subscription) concerts. Among these have been special recitals by Arthur Rubenstein, Marian Anderson, and Vladimir Horowitz. The University Musical Society and School of Music have also sponsored benefit concerts for the School of Music featuring artists of international repute with the University Symphony. Many world premieres of choral and orchestral works have been commissioned by the University Musical Society and performed by the Choral Union.</p>
      <p>In the 1980s and 1990s the University Musical Society faced the challenge of the increasing costs of performances and of the need to raise a considerable portion of the operating budget through gifts. The latter led to an expansion in the development efforts of the staff. There was also a perceived need to offer a more varied choice of performances in order to attract patrons of all ages and musical taste. The work space occupied by the UMS, Burton Tower, and Hill Auditorium, its major venue, were both in need of renovation. Changes and activities documented in the 1990-1998 accession include the demise of the May Festival and the beginning of the Distinguished Artist Award--the last May Festival took place in 1995; the Distinguished Artist Award was first awarded in May 1996--and the development of a renovation plan for Hill Auditorium. The plan was approved by the Regents in September 1990 and fund raising began as part of the university's Capital Campaign.</p>

      <p>The records of the University Musical Society document its founding in 1879, governance and administrative restructuring through the years, its activities sponsoring musical, dance and theatrical performances on campus, and its role in music and arts education. The records include directors' correspondence files, board of directors minutes, ledgers and financial records, photographs, sound recordings and videotapes.</p>
      <p>Intellectually, the records are organized into eight series: Directors' Correspondence, Financial records, Historical file, Board of Directors, Committees, Topical File, Contracts, Photographs, President's Correspondence, Staff Files, Executive Directors' Files, and Motion Pictures (film, videotape and dvd).</p>
      <p>The records were received in several major and numerous small accessions and the physical arrangement of the records (the order in which they are arranged in boxes/folders) reflects this. In this finding aid, the records are described in term of their intellectual organization regardless of the particular accession in which they were received. As a result, the box number order in which the descriptions are displayed in the contents list will not always be consecutive.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The series Director's Correspondence, 1898 to 1983 (boxes 1-64, 68-98, 103-106) is by far the largest in the collection and probably provides the greatest research interest. The correspondence covers the tenures of directors Francis W. Kelsey, Charles A. Sink and Gail W. Rector. The Directors' Correspondence series is organized by year and thereunder alphabetically by correspondent. There are occasional exceptions to this, for example, correspondence with or related to the National Association of Concert Managers, 1956-1962, is all filed under 1956 (box 79). This file reflects Charles Sink's important role within that organization.</p>
          <p>Certain portions of the correspondence from the Rector years have been sampled, among these are correspondence from contributors, thank you notes from school groups and others receiving complimentary tickets, complaints, and "fan" letters. The large volume of inquiries received annually by Mr. Rector from both agents and performing artists interested in participating in a UMS concert series have not been retained.</p>
          <p>Prior to 1941, correspondence regarding the School of Music is also found in this series. In general, however, the early correspondence is of low research value, serving the UMS as a general office file and containing great quantities of routine information about ticket purchases and other predictable concerns.</p>
          <p>This series contains correspondence relating to events sponsored under the auspices of the University Musical Society. When attempting to locate artist correspondence in this series, it is recommended that the researcher look under both the artist and agent names. The greater bulk of correspondence with regard to individual artists is handled through the agent, rather than the artist themselves. There are, however, exceptions to this rule.</p>
          <p>The Philadelphia Orchestra and May Festival folders contain a large amount of correspondence from conductor Eugene Ormandy, often providing insights into his ideas regarding programming and interpretation of specific works. Correspondence of other May Festival participants can also be found in various May Festival folders. A number of letters from composer Aaron Copland are included in the 1976 folders. He conducted several of his works in that year's May Festival.</p>
          <p>Many artists of outstanding international repute are also represented in this series. Vladimir Horowitz gave several performances for the UMS and his correspondence is located in the folders of his agent, Harold Shaw, for the years 1976 and 1978. A list of Horowitz's personal requests for a performance is included, as is correspondence with his wife, Wanda Toscanini Horowitz, who discusses the presentation of a film honoring her father that was to be presented in conjunction with a performance of her husband.</p>
          <p>In 1981 Alberto Ginastera was commissioned to write a piano concerto to be premiered by Anthony di Bonaventura at a UMS concert. Correspondence related to this event is located in the Thea Dispeker Artists folder. The 1982 Ann Arbor Summer Festival folder includes transcripts of two interviews Gail Rector conducted with French mime Marcel Marceau.</p>
          <p>A large number of artists are represented in the 1983 and 1984 Gail Rector 25th anniversary folders. These are indicative of the relationships Rector established with these artists during his tenure with the University Musical Society.</p>
          <p>Probably some of the more surprising correspondence in this collection are a series of letters from Dr. Jack Kevorkian in 1976 and 1977. He was involved in the production of a video of UMS Messiah performances.</p>
          <p>As stated above, this collection does not attempt to represent the hundreds of inquiries for performance received by Mr. Rector. However, evidence of the scope of these inquiries can be found in many of the agent folders.</p>

          <p>The Board of Directors series is divided into four subseries: Miscellaneous Files, 1876-1983; Minutes/Financial Reports, 1938-1994; Meeting Packets, 1988-2001; and Audiotapes, 1954-1988. The Miscellaneous subseries contains several folders of primarily correspondence dating from 1976 to 1983.</p>
          <p>The minutes were bound and the pages consecutively numbered through June 1989. This series includes thirteen bound volumes (1876 through June 1989) and loose minutes (July 1989 through July 1994). Both the bound and the loose minutes include related items documenting the activities of the Board of Directors, its Executive Committee and the following UMS committees: Development, Long-Range Planning/Implementation, Budget and Finance and Marketing. Minutes of the annual meeting of the University Musical Society are included in the Board of Directors Minutes. Earlier minutes of the UMS are found in earlier accessions. Please consult the summary contents lists for information about the complete run of minutes.</p>
          <p>The Board of Directors Packets were maintained by UMS staff for February and April 1988 and for the years 1990 through June 1997. Included in the packets are agendas and minutes (which may duplicate materials in the previous series) and additional background information prepared for the board members, including reports from standing committees such as Development, Marketing, Programming, and Long-Range Planning.</p>
          <p>The audiotapes of Board of Directors meetings (99 cassettes) span 1954-1988, but do not provide a complete run of the meetings.</p>

          <p>A wide array of subjects is covered in the Topical Files series. Records and correspondence that document the inception of the first Ann Arbor Summer Festival are included, as are similar materials for the Fair Lane Festival, a summer endeavor of the University Musical Society that took place in 1967, on the grounds of the Henry Ford estate on the University of Michigan-Dearborn campus. Of additional interest is a folder that lists the world premieres presented by the UMS and two folders of historical materials which include a letter and prints of Jenny Lind, the legendary Swedish singer of the late nineteenth century. Additional material includes a musical autograph of violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler.</p>

          <p>The Contracts series provides copies of the final contracts for performances for the years 1933/34-1984/85 and 1986-2001. The earlier seasons tend to be represented more completely than the later. Contracts for seasons in the 1970s and 1980s are not represented in their entirety. For the most part, these files include only contracts, no accompanying correspondence. Cover letters and related correspondence are found in the Correspondence series. The 1986-2001 contracts are closed .</p>

          <p>The Photographs series is organized into four subseries: Facilities, Portraits, Artist and Performance Photos, and Unidentified and Miscellaneous. The Facilities file contains pictures of Hill Auditorium. The Portraits subseries consist of pictures of members of the UMS Board of Directors and UMS officers.</p>
          <p>Artist and Performance Photographs include several oversized mounted prints of performances from May Festivals in 1918, 1943 and 1946. The bulk of the series consists of, with very rare exceptions, a complete run of artist photographs for concerts from the 1957/58 season through 1977/78. These photographs were maintained by the UMS along with the corresponding programs. In the 1968/69 and subsequent folders, reviews of concerts are also included. The majority of the photographs came from the artists themselves, and most of them are also autographed. The boxlist includes a note of those photographs for each year that were taken locally, many of them at Hill Auditorium. In locating a photograph of a given artist, it may serve the researcher well to first look through the programs included in the UMS Publications, and then locate the corresponding folder of photographs.</p>

          <p>The President's and Executive Director's Correspondence series includes one folder of correspondence created by UMS President Charles Sink regarding the May Festival, 1928 and 1930-1935. The correspondence of President Gail Rector covers the years 1984 through July 1987 when Rector retired as president of the University Musical Society. The correspondence of Executive Director Kenneth Fischer begins in 1987 and continues through 1988. The correspondence is organized alphabetically; the 1988 files include two folders of correspondence organized in chronological order.</p>
          <p>The correspondence documents communication with artists' agents, artists, concert goers and other arts managers. Included is documentation of the Ann Arbor Summer Festival (AASF) with which Gail Rector was active. Ann Arbor Summer Festival Board of Trustees minutes, and files related to the AASF Executive Committee, Programming Committee and Marketing Committee were not kept as they can be found in the papers of Eugene Power also held by the Bentley Library. Eugene Power founded the festival in 1978.</p>
          <p>For the first few years of Kenneth Fischer's tenure as executive director, the UMS staff used the same alphabetical filing system for correspondence. With Fischer's tenure, a topical file, not broken by year, was also instituted (see Topical Files below).</p>

          <p>The Presidents' Topical Files series includes documentation from the years 1964-1973 of Gail Rector's tenure, and the years 1987-1994 of Kenneth Fischer's tenure. The files are not broken by year. The folder "Hill Auditorium Renovation, 1990-1992" contains a detailed "History of Hill Auditorium At the University of Michigan" by Ernest O. Moore written for the Office of the University Planner in 1978. The "Love Letters" folders contain congratulatory letters and letters thanking Kenneth Fischer and the UMS staff from performers, patrons, community leaders, impresario colleagues and musical professionals, members of the UM and Ann Arbor communities and friends. Thank you letters were sent for tickets received, presentations made, for community service performed, and, in general, for the quality of presentations provided by the University Musical Society.</p>
