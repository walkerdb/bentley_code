      <abstract>Jeffrey R. Parsons was Curator of Latin American Archaeology and Director of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan. He was a professor at the same institution for over forty years starting in 1966 and carried out extensive research on settlement patterns in the basin of Mexico, in Peru, and in many other countries. Parsons is known for his role in the development of systematic settlement survey methods in archaeology, a methodology which has become common in archaeological work around the world. Material includes papers, maps, site surveys, photo negatives, aerial photographs and digital scans of the negatives.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Jeffrey R. Parsons was born in Washington, D.C., in October 9, 1939. During his childhood, he and his family moved to Philadelphia for a period of five years and afterwards settled in Fairfax, Virginia. He would return as an undergraduate student to Pennsylvania to study geology at the Pennsylvania State University. It was in choosing elective courses that Parsons was introduced to archaeology and anthropology. His interest in those disciplines led him to pursue a graduate education in anthropology. After applying and being accepted to the University of Arizona and the University of Michigan, Parsons chose the program in Michigan where James B. Griffin offered an assistantship at the Museum of Anthropology.</p>
      <p>Parsons completed his undergraduate degree in geology and mineralogy in 1961. That summer, and the years to follow, provided a time for him to acquire fieldwork experience through several projects with the Pennsylvania State University. Parsons worked as a field assistant with William Sanders' Teotihuacan Valley Project in Mexico from 1961 to 1966. In 1966, he also worked during a three month period with the Tikal Sustaining Area Project in Guatemala.</p>
      <p>The implementation of systematic settlement pattern survey methodology in the Teotihuacan Valley Project played a significant role in the development of archaeology. The use of this methodology reflected a shift in the field of archaeology to a focus on anthropological and cultural issues. Parsons participated in the implementation of this methodology as well as in developing regional surveying for the project. This methodology involved the use of regional surveying of settlement remains to study and find patterns of occupation. This would become standard methodology within the field.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Parsons was completing his graduate studies in Anthropology while also working as a radiocarbon dating clerk at the Museum of Anthropology. Such experience allowed him to become familiar with ongoing archaeological research around the world. By the end of his Ph.D. studies in 1966, Parsons had started teaching as an assistant professor, as a result of his growing expertise in Mesoamerican archaeology and the University's need for an archaeologist specializing in Latin America. That same year, he also became Curator of Latin American Archaeology at the Museum of Anthropology.</p>
      <p>In the following years Parsons developed systematic settlement pattern surveys throughout the Basin of Mexico building on the Teotihuacan Valley Project. The successive site surveys included the Texcoco region in 1967 in the eastern part of the Basin, the areas of Chalco and Xochimilco in the southern Basin in 1969 and 1972, and the northern Basin, specifically the Zumpango area in 1973. Parsons intended for surveys to be an initial stage to further intensive research of the sites. Later research by a number of colleagues and students in the following decades focused their archaeological research on some areas covered by these initial surveys.</p>
      <p>Parsons' archaeological research took him to Peru and Argentina for work on settlement patterns. During the late 1970s he participated in several field studies, sponsored by the University of Michigan in the U.S., specifically in New Mexico, Kentucky, and Alabama. The following decade, Parsons carried out ethno-archaeological research in Mezquital, Nexquipayac, and Chimalhuacan, Mexico looking at the use of maguey, salt-making, and insect collection. Other research projects have taken Parsons to Iceland, Egypt, Australia, Mongolia, and Italy. Most of these projects were funded by the National Science Foundation, while a smaller number by the University of Michigan, and the National Geographic Society.</p>
      <p>Parson's teaching and administrative experience also expanded beyond the University of Michigan. He went on to become associate professor, later professor of Anthropology, and Director of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan before also working as a visiting professor in various Latin American countries, mainly during the 1990s. He was invited as professor to the National Autonomous University in Mexico, to the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, to the National Universities of Tucumán and Catamarca, both in Argentina, as well as to the Higher University of San Andrés in Bolivia. At the University of Michigan, Parsons also became involved with the program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies as Acting and Interim Director for brief one year periods in 1991 and 2001.</p>
      <p>In 1968 Parsons married Mary Hrones, a fellow archaeologist whom he had met at the graduate program in Michigan. Hrones and Parsons had worked together in several of the Mexico Basin survey projects and would collaborate again in their research on Peru and other countries in later years. They had one daughter, Apphia, in 1975.</p>
      <p>Parsons' achievements in archaeology, teaching, and research have been recognized by his colleagues and several institutions. He was awarded the American Anthropological Association's Alfred V. Kidder Award for lifetime achievement in 1998. In 2002 the University of Michigan, awarded him the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award. More recently, in 2005, colleagues published <title render="italic">Settlement, Subsistence, and Social Complexity: Essays Honoring the Legacy of Jeffrey R. Parsons</title>.</p>

      <p>The Jeffrey R. Parsons papers document the archaeologist's research in the Basin of Mexico, his work at the University of Michigan as professor, Curator of Latin American Archaeology, and Director of the Museum of Anthropology, and his work with colleagues and institutions around the world. Materials date from 1960 to 2009 while the bulk of it is from 1966 to 1973. The majority is related to his fieldwork in the Valley of Mexico and includes paper, photographic material, maps, and documentation about materials collected as part of the surveys, such as information on ceramic sherds. The collection is arranged in nine series: Personal Files, Correspondence 1966-2005, Archaeological Sites and Projects, Topical Files, Publications, Student Years, Visual Materials Series, and Maps.</p>

          <p>Parsons carried on an extensive correspondence beginning in his student days and extending throughout his career. Correspondents include many of the leading figures in archeological field work and document his own research as well as his professional activities. The correspondence series is organized into two alphabetically arranged subseries for the years 1966-1990 (acquired directly from Parsons) and 1990-2005 (received through the Museum of Anthropology).</p>

            <p>The subseries Correspondence, 1966-1990 (4.75 linear feet), the first of two correspondence files, includes Parsons' incoming and outgoing correspondence during the first decades of his professional career. The time period for the materials starts in the late 1960s while Parsons was completing his Ph.D. at the same time as teaching at the University of Michigan and doing field research in the Basin of Mexico. It goes on to document Parsons' field work in other regions in Mexico, Peru, and Iceland as well as his work with the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology and as a professor in Peru, Mexico, and Michigan.</p>
            <p>The subseries is comprised mostly of letters, telegrams, research proposal materials, some postcards and greeting cards among other formats. Materials include correspondence related to his courses, research publications, and professional associations. Correspondence includes communications with mentors, students, fellow archaeologists and anthropologists, renowned figures in the field, the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, the College of Literature, Science and Arts, international collaborators and institutions. Some correspondents include: Elizabeth Brumfield, Terence D'Altroy, Larry Gorenflo, James B. Griffin, Charles Hastings, Mary Hodge, Darell LaLone, Ramiro Matos Mendieta, Thomas McGovern, Elinor Melville, Timothy Earle, Deborah Nichols, Lorenzo Roselló Truel, Norbert Ptusy, William T. Sanders, and Mari Carmen Serra.</p>
            <p>Materials for the subseries were received directly from Parsons. Among these, two distinct groupings are discernible. This is reflected in the arrangement where sometimes two or more folders for the same letter will be present. Materials are arranged alphabetically and include miscellaneous folders by letter as well as named folders for frequent correspondents.</p>

            <p>The subseries Correspondence, 1990-2005 (5.75 linear feet) was a separately maintained file which extends and continues the earlier subseries of correspondence covering 1966-1990. The content of this alphabetically arranged subseries was received from the Museum of Anthropology. It includes Parsons' correspondence for a period of approximately 15 years. Materials reflect his multi-faceted professional life during the years he directed the Program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies, was Visiting Professor in Argentina and Bolivia, taught as professor of anthropology, and was Curator of Latin American Archaeology in the Museum of Anthropology.</p>
            <p>The subseries documents Parsons' work with professional associations, his teaching work in universities in Argentina and Bolivia and his field research in Mexico, Argentina, Egypt, Australia, Italy and Mongolia. There is extensive correspondence with national and international colleagues and contacts, including many of the correspondents named in the first series, as well as John Clark, Andrew Darling, Paul Durrenburger, Susan Evans, Suzanne Fish, Frances Hayashida, Mary Hodge, William Honeychurch, William Isbell, Richard Lesure, Charles Kolb, Ramiro Matos, Leah Minc, Hellen Pollard, Dean Snow, Charles Stanish and Eric Wolf.</p>

          <p>The Archaeological Sites and Projects, 1966 - 2010 series (19.25 linear feet) document Parsons' field research, mainly doing systematic settlement pattern surveying. This is the largest series in the collection. Materials included are the product of survey research on each site and consist of site reports, field notebooks, surveys, photos, and additional documentation about the sites and the research carried out. The series is made up of eight subseries and arranged by archaeological site and year and include sites in the Valley of Mexico and Peru. The subseries included are Texcoco 1967, Chalco 1969, Ixtapalapa 1969, Chalco-Xochimilco 1972, Zumpango 1973, Mexico Ceramic Surveys, Ethnographic Field Research, and Peru 1996-2010. Survey Site Reports are labeled by site number and survey strip and provide information on the natural setting of the site, modern cultural features, prehistoric features, as well as a summary and impressions on the site. Site report files regularly include photographic contact prints of the site illustrating the information gathered and include references to geographical location, roll number and shot. Additional materials per site may hold reports, maps, population data, illustrations, keys to survey materials and quantitative information.</p>

            <p>The Zumpango 1973 sub series (3.25 linear feet) holds the site reports and notebooks along with ceramic analyses for the project. A number of indices for Zumpango photographic rolls are also part of the contents. Site notebooks data was gathered by Jeffrey and Mary Parsons. A third group of documents are map related materials. These are paper materials that were received with the maps for the Zumpango region and have been housed with the site materials.</p>

            <p>The Peru subseries 1966-2010 (5 linear feet), is comprised of materials from Parson's survey research in Peru, in the Upper Mantaro Region and the Junin Department. The content is divided into three groupings: Peru, Junin Survey and Wanka Survey material. Documents are, for the most part, survey materials and field notes for the Junin and Wanka Surveys, with specific documentation on Junin, Tarma, Jauja, and Huancayo. Additional material includes indices, classifications, reports, and other research material. These surveys, and thus the majority of the content, date from 1975 to 1976. However, this subseries does have a small number of research material and ceramic inventories, ranging from 2004 to 2010, related to the earlier research.</p>

          <p>The Maps Series, 1960-1984 (18 linear feet and 1 oversize folder) contents are arranged in three subseries, photo mosaics, tracings, and Peru maps. The materials in all subseries are arranged by archaeological site. The photo mosaics are 50 x 50 cms 1:5000 aerial photo prints that can be set up together into one mosaic of the sit e. The second subseries is made up of what was originally 9 tube boxes with rolled map tracings of the 1:5000 survey photo mosaics. These can be three to five feet wide and may include references to the corresponding site mosaic section. Some of the aerial photos used for the mosaics and prints were the product of an earlier flight and may have been used for different surveys in different years. Three Zumpango files that were received with the map tracings have been housed with the site materials. The third subseries holds maps of Peru, particularly of the Upper Mantaro Region. These have been housed in oversize folders.</p>
