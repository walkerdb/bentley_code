      <p>United States land offices were the agencies responsible for the sale of the public land to individual purchasers. The first land office in Michigan was established in Detroit in 1804, although no land sales were held until 1818. As sales expanded, additional offices were established in Monroe (1823), White Pigeon (1831), Ionia (1836), Flint (1836), Sault Ste. Marie (1847), and Duncan (1854). In 1888, after several of the offices had been moved or consolidated, the state was served by four land offices, in Detroit, East Saginaw, Reed City, and Marquette. In that year, the three Lower Peninsula offices were consolidated and moved to Grayling. In 1898, the Grayling office was closed and the Marquette office became responsible for the entire state. The Marquette land office, in turn, was closed in 1925.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The records originally came from two sources. Volumes 1-51 and 78 to 87 (tract books for the Lower Peninsula) and the outsize folders (Lower Peninsula plat maps) are copies of earlier records made in 1894 for the Grayling Land Office. When that office was closed in 1898 the records were transferred to the Marquette Land Office. Volumes 52-77 and 88 (tract books for the Upper Peninsula) and volumes 150A-161 (plat maps for the Upper Peninsula) are the original records kept in the Marquette Land Office (originally in Sault Ste. Marie) beginning in 1847.</p>
      <p>The records were transferred to the General Land Office in Washington, D.C., when the Marquette Land Office was closed in 1925. In 1940, the Auditor General of Michigan, who was the chairman of the Michigan State Land Office Board, accepted the records for the state. (The State Land Office Board was established in 1937, and was not related to the Michigan State Land Office, which was abolished in 1914 and replaced by the Public Domain Commission.) Because of crowded conditions in the State Capitol, the Auditor General asked that the records be deposited in the Michigan Historical Collections, where they could be used by a WPA Writers Project study of the disposal of public lands in Michigan. They have been on deposit at this library since that time.</p>

          <p>The tract books detail the original sale by the federal government of each piece of public land in the state, beginning with the opening of the Detroit Land Office in 1818. (These volumes do not include information about lands contained in private claims.)</p>
          <p>The tract books for the Upper Peninsula are original records kept, beginning in 1847, by the land office in Sault Ste. Marie (in 1857 moved to Marquette). The tract books for the Lower Peninsula were copied, by hand in 1894, from an earlier record. After the earlier records were copied, some new entries were added and old entries were revised or updated. Some entries are dated as late as 1920. The tract books are arranged (in a somewhat random order) by township number, and within each township by section.</p>
          <p>No names of townships appear in the collection, so it will be necessary for the researcher to discover the numerical designation in terms of township and range. A brief description of townships, ranges, and other details of the U.S. land survey system can be found (as of 2007) at the web site of the National Atlas of the United States http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html. The range, township, and section of a particular place can be found using maps such as those in Henry F. Walling's <title render="italic">Atlas of the State of Michigan</title> (Detroit: R. M. and S. T. Tackabury, 1873, 1875, or 1884); or the <title render="italic">Mapbook of Michigan Counties</title> (Lansing: Two Peninsula Press, 1984). Range and township numbers for Washtenaw County Townships are as follows:</p>

          <p>Since the townships are arranged in a somewhat random order, an index to the 88 volumes by township and range has been created. It is found appended to this finding aid.</p>
          <p>The information contained in an individual entry includes an exact description of the land purchased, the number of acres included in the transaction, the price per acre, the total purchase price, the name of the purchaser, the date of sale, the receipt number, and the person to whom the land was patented if this was different from the name of the purchaser. Quite often the date when the land was placed on sale appears on the page.</p>
          <p>Indexes to the tract books by the name of the purchaser have been made. The most convenient (as of 2007) is the General Land Office Land Records web site maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management: http://www.glorecords.blm.gov. Transcriptions of and indexes to tract books have been published for several counties. These can be found in the library's online catalog under the subject "Landowners Michigan ... County Indexes". Since these books were compiled from copies of tract books in other repositories, some names and locations may not correspond exactly to the library's copy. These indexes generally show the residence of each purchaser, a piece of information not included in the library's copy of the records.</p>
          <p>A 1942 project by Anne Case and Theodore Clark produced a card file listing the purchaser's name and county for land purchases of 640 acres or more in these 19 counties: Antrim, Berrien, Cheboygan, Crawford, Gladwin, Ingham, Ionia, Iosco, Isabella, Lenawee, Newaygo, St. Clair, and Wexford in the Lower Peninsula, and Gogebic, Keweenaw, Luce, Marquette, Menominee, and Schoolcraft in the Upper Peninsula. The card file is not part of this electronic finding aid and is only available at the Bentley Library.</p>

          <p>Plat books (v. 150A-161 and 69 outsize folders in Boxes 1-20): The collection originally contained 73 volumes of plat books, containing copies of the original maps produced by the U.S. land survey for all townships in Michigan, along with some original maps of later surveys of private claims and government reserves. The main series of township plats is drawn at a scale of 1:31,680 (2 inches to a mile). Some of the maps (especially those of the southern Lower Peninsula) include only section outlines, bearings, deviations, and a few landmark physical features located on section lines. Other maps (especially for the Upper Peninsula) include extensive information about physical and cultural features. As a general rule, none of these maps show land ownership. The plat books for the Lower Peninsula are lithographic copies made in 1894. The Upper Peninsula maps are hand-drawn copies, made beginning in 1847, and have extensive later annotations.</p>
          <p>Upper Peninsula plat books (v. 150A-161) are arranged by range number, so any township can be found easily if its numerical designation is known. The Lower Peninsula plat books (formerly v. 89-149) have been disbound, and arranged alphabetically by county in Boxes 1-20. (A few loose Upper Peninsula maps are also found in the boxes.)</p>
          <p>Another set of these plat maps is held by the State of Michigan, and has been made available online through the Dept. of Natural Resources General Land Office Plats web site http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/1,1607,7-153-10371_14793-31058--,00.html.</p>
