      <p>The origin of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL) can be traced to two related projects initiated in the 1930s at the University of Michigan. In early 1934, Professor Lewis G. Vander Velde successfully applied for a $700 grant to locate and collect printed material relating to the history of Michigan. Approximately a year later, in November 1935, University of Michigan President Alexander Ruthven appointed a Committee on University Archives and authorized it to gather together the university's historical records. Vander Velde served as secretary to this committee. Space was set aside in the William L. Clements Library for both projects, and Vander Velde, with the assistance of a single graduate student, undertook both projects. In June 1938, the two enterprises moved into three rooms of the newly completed Rackham Building. That same year the Regents named the endeavor the Michigan Historical Collections (MHC). In 1973, the library moved from its quarters in the Rackham Building into the newly completed Bentley Historical Library on the university's north campus. For the first time, the MHC had for a home a facility designed and built for the processing and use of the manuscript and archival materials that it had been collecting for nearly forty years.</p>
      <p>In the formative years of the MHC, Vander Velde supervised a surprisingly large staff. Funds from the Works Progress Administration made possible the hiring of a large number of special assistants. In 1939, twenty individuals were packing, processing, and cleaning records as they were collected. Although World War II quickly drained away the funds used to pay these many employees, a great deal of work was accomplished and Vander Velde retained some professional assistance. In 1938 or 1939, Vander Velde hired a full-time assistant primarily to collect historical records. In 1951, he added a permanent printed works librarian to the staff.</p>
      <p>In 1947, Vander Velde was appointed chair of the university's history department. To lighten his administrative burden at the MHC, F. Clever Bald was appointed to the newly created post, assistant director. Vander Velde retained the title of director of the MHC until 1960, when he retired and was succeeded by Bald. In 1966 Bald retired and was succeeded by Robert M. Warner. In 1980, Warner resigned as director to become head of the National Archives. Richard Doolen served as acting director until 1981 when Francis X. Blouin, Jr. became the fourth director of the BHL. Blouin served more than thirty years, stepping down in 2013, to be succeeded by Terrence J. McDonald, the former dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts.</p>
      <p>In 1979, a separate program for the administration of the university archives was formally established. The University Archives and Records Program (UARP) became a separate division alongside the MHC, which continued to focus on documenting the state of Michigan. Reference services and conservation were reconfigured as divisions providing a structure of four divisions (MHC, UARP, Reference and Access, and Preservation and Conservation) under the broader designation of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL).</p>
      <p>In 2004, an addition to the Bentley Historical Library's building was completed. This project increased the storage capacity for the library's collections and provided new offices for staff members of UARP. The new wing's dedication coincided with the publication of <title render="italic">The Bentley Historical Library: Its History and Purpose</title>, an in-depth review of the library and its collections.</p>
      <p>Francis Blouin also oversaw the creation of the Digital Curation Division in 2011. The unit was given responsibility for implementing solutions for the long-term preservation and management of the library's digital assets. Digital Curation supports the mission of the library's other branches by administering born digital and digitized materials for the University Archives and Michigan Historical Collections and also promoting access to digital archives for Reference and Access Services.</p>
      <p>In September 2013 Terrence J. McDonald, former Dean of the university's College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, assumed the directorship of the Bentley Historical Library. Under his leadership, the library hired its first development officer and participated in the university's Victors for Michigan capital campaign. McDonald also oversaw the reorganization of, the library's units in the summer of 2014. The Academic Programs and Collection Development division assumed responsibility for classroom instruction, reference and access services, outreach, and field work at the University of Michigan and around the state. The Curation division rationalized the processing activities of the MHC, UARP and the Digital Curation Division, incorporating procedures for both physical and digital archives, and also assumed responsibility for web archiving and digitization activities.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Records subgroup (1935-2013, 35.5 linear feet) begins with the Meetings series (1956-2012, 1.5 linear feet), which contain the agendas, minutes and correspondence of the Executive Committee Meetings, the Friends of the Michigan Historical Collection and Bentley Library, the Bentley Library's Administrative Committee, and Staff Meetings. The next set of series are organized by director (see the list above). The first subseries category is the Director's Office/Central Files, which are administrative records generated by the director and the associate director including correspondence, evaluation and planning, fundraising, physical facilities documents, and budget materials. The Staff files subseries, contains staff meetings, staff lists, staff interviews, manuals and farewell parties. The Conferences and Events subseries consists of agendas and speeches and planning material from Bentley-related conferences. Materials in this subseries from the tenure of Francis Blouin include digital materials from the Visual Culture and Archives Symposium held April 4-5, 2013 in honor of Blouin's 32 years of service to the library. The Special Projects subseries includes material regarding intensive activities undertaken by the BHL that often were in some way distinct from core functions. In many cases, a "special project" is one that received outside funding.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>Among Blouin's records are planning documents that include results of five-year reviews of the library for 1986, 1991, and 1996, and there are a number of files documenting the evolution of archival education at the University of Michigan through the 1980s. There are also papers and correspondence regarding work in 1993, which resulted in a special issue of the <title render="italic">American Archivist</title> devoted to diplomacy. Also of interest is documentation of the Vatican Archives Project, which resulted in <title render="italic">Vatican Archives, An Inventory and Guide to Historical Documents of the Holy See.</title></p>
            <p>The 2014 accession of Francis X. Blouin's files is divided into two additional sub-series. The first, Topical Files, 1974-2013 (3.8 linear feet), consists of a mixture of administrative, events and special projects materials, arranged alphabetically. This arrangement reflects how these files had come to be maintained in the director's office. The second, International, 1991-2012 (1.2 linear feet), contains materials related to the library's international programs and is arranged alphabetically by country. Files relating to William Wallach, Associate Director, 1958-2010, bulk 1978-2010, (2.5 linear feet), are arranged in two sub-series: Topical, 1958-2010 (1.5 linear feet) and Building Addition, 1998-2004 (1.0 linear foot).</p>

            <p>The next series in the Administrative Records subgroup is the Non-Donor Correspondence (10 linear feet), which is arranged in three alphabetical accessions, each of which covers a period of time. This series contains several kinds of correspondence: there are letters to and from individuals who eventually become donors and financial contributors, as well as letters seeking publication permissions. Most notably, there is professional correspondence between archivists: letters exchanged between leading archivists and Lewis Vander Velde in the 1930s and 1940s, Robert Warner during the late 1960s and 1970s and by Francis X. Blouin in the 1980s and 1990. Taken as a whole, this correspondence demonstrates the growing international influence of the Bentley. Until 1987, the Non-Donor Correspondence included some reference inquiries, after 1987, these records were maintained separately by the Reference Archivist. There is also a folder compiling twenty-five years of thank you notes from various colleagues and professionals from around the country.</p>

            <p>The Access and Reference Services, series 1961-2000 (3 linear feet) is broken down into Reference Archivist's files and Reference Reports. Files of the Reference Archivist are grouped according to the department heads. Mary Jo Pugh, Reference Archivist from 1969 to 1984, was the first Reference Archivist of the library. Her topical files include early policy, reference procedures, staff training, guides, and educational outreach activities. Nancy Bartlett was the Reference Archivist from 1985-1998. These records also emphasize reference policy, procedure, and education. The use of visual and electronic archival materials becomes more apparent. A significant number of files relate to outreach efforts within the community including a long-standing partnership with Eastern Michigan University's history program. Kathy Marquis was the third person to hold the Reference Archivist position, 1998-2002. Her records reflect student research at the library through correspondence and project files. They also contain major university issues during the time period including the affirmative action lawsuit. Reference staff development is also portrayed through the development of manuals and meeting minutes.</p>
            <p>The second subseries in this accession is Reference Reports. The early years of reference are shown through the Work Reports. Research topics, user statistics, sample questions, reproduction requests, and annual studies were carefully documented. The Work Report format split into Monthly Reports and Annual Reports in the mid-1980s although generally contain the same type of information. The reports clearly track reference trends and use through the library's history.</p>

              <p>Tthe Reference Reports subseries consistst of a variety of monthly and annual reports on the division's activities. The early years of reference are shown through the Work Reports. Research topics, user statistics, sample questions, reproduction requests, and annual studies were carefully documented. The Work Report format split into Monthly Reports and Annual Reports in the mid-1980s although generally contain the same type of information. The reports clearly track reference trends and use through the library's history.</p>

            <p>The Michigan Historical Collections series (1919-2014, bulk 1935-2014, 9.5 linear feet and one oversize box) consists of seven subseries: Office Diaries; Field Program; Topical Files; Reports; Thomas Powers' Talks; Len Coombs's files; and Lost, Recataloged, Discarded or Transferred Materials. A long run of Office Diaries (2 linear feet) covers the years 1935-1963.</p>

              <p>Early on, the diaries were relatively informative documents, often including entries describing visitors and events at the BHL. Increasingly, however, they became more like logbooks recording commonplace transactions, such as the number of letters prepared each day and the name of each letter's recipient.</p>

              <p>The Field Program subseries, 1937-2002 (2 linear feet) begins with "trip reports" written between 1935 and 1985. A trip report is a written summary of a contact by a BHL staff member and a donor or potential donor of material. The subseries also includes "Donor Lead Sheets" for the period 1988 and 1995 which are arranged alphabetically and contain information regarding the pursuit of specific collections; and "Donor Lead Card Catalog" for the period 1960s-2000s with names, addresses, and field notes, also arranged alphabetically, located in an oversize box.</p>

              <p>Two boxes of catalog index cards comprise the subseries, Lost, Re-cataloged, Discarded or Transferred Materials, 1949-1989 (0.6 linear feet). This assembly was largely generated during the transition from a card catalog to an online public access catalog system, when items that had been separately cataloged were returned to their collections of origin to be described collectively in finding aids, rather than through separate entries.</p>

            <p>The Preservation and Conservation series (1977-2010, 2.3 linear feet) contains two subseries, Microfilm Projects, 1987-2010 (2.2 linear feet) and Reports, 1977-2007 (0.1 linear foot). The Microfilm Projects subseries consist of two alphabetic sequences that span different time periods (1987-2004) and (2000-2010). They were created by archivist Ann Flowers as she prepared individual collections for microfilming. They contain correspondence with the microphotography contractors and her quality control and cost analyses. The records are in alphabetical order by collection name.</p>

            <p>The University Archives and Records Program (UARP) series, 1973-2004, bulk 1981-2004 (7.5 linear feet) records are divided into five subseries: Agendas and Minutes, Marjorie Barritt, Nancy Bartlett, Staff Files and Manuals.</p>
            <p>The Agendas and Minutes, 1988-2004 subseries (0.5 linear feet) contains records of periodic staff meetings. UARP's first head, Marjorie Barritt, contributed records (2.3 linear feet) that evidence the germination of the UARP program, its evolution and growth from the 1980s to the late 1990s, and the development of records policy at the University of Michigan. Together with the records of her successor, Nancy Bartlett (0.8 linear feet) and electronic records archivist Nancy Deromedi found in Staff Files (5.5 linear feet), Barritt's subseries documents UARP's long continuing interest in addressing issues revolving around the archival management of electronic records. UARP's involvement with international archival issues, including Marjorie Barritt's and Nancy Bartlett's editorial management of a special issue of the <title render="italic">American Archivist</title> devoted to international archives, is also well documented. Nancy Bartlett's files also contain her records of teaching the practice of appraisal to archives students at the University of Michigan's School of Information.</p>
            <p>The Staff files subseries contains records generated by UARP staff, including assistant division head Brian Williams, electronic records archivist Nancy Deromedi, and associate archivist Marilyn McNitt. Brian Williams's files document the Bentley's work in advising the archives of the African National Congress University of Fort Hare in South Africa and the development of a collection strategy for documenting the history of medicine at the University of Michigan. The files of Nancy Deromedi, who later became head of the newly-formed Digital Curation Services division in 2011, document efforts to preserve and manage digital records, particularly the university's web presence and faculty and administration email. Marilyn McNitt's files include materials on exhibits planned by her as well as records relating to a project in which UARP provided the University of Michigan-Dearborn administration with consultation on records management and appraised and processed some of the Dearborn campus's records. The small subseries, Manuals, 1989-1994 (0.2 linear feet) includes instructions for UARP staff conducting field appraisal and processing collections. The unit's <title render="italic">Records Policy and Procedures Manual</title> 1993, was widely distributed throughout the university and is thus located in the "Bentley Historical Library Publications" record group, which has a separate finding aid.</p>

            <p>The Exhibits series (1929-2014, 7.5 linear feet, one oversize box, 149 MG) is comprised of material prepared by BHL staff for both internal and external exhibits. Most of the files contain the corresponding display labels; for some there are also photocopies of source material and background information. The series is arranged alphabetically by the title of the exhibit and consists of two accessions dated 1929-2007 (7 linear feet) and 1998-2013 (0.5 linear feet). A chronological listings of exhibits, 1929-1961, and newspaper clippings regarding exhibits, 1943-1959, precede the individual exhibit files. There are five boxes of Exhibit material (images and labels on poster board) from an exhibit on Michigan in the Olympics, on Women at the University of Michigan from 1870 to the Present, and from miscellaneous images from the Bentley Library.</p>
            <p>Researchers should note that several exhibits are individually cataloged. The latter includes University of Michigan Sesquicentennial Celebration Exhibition photograph collection, A Gallery of presidents, Goin' north: Black Detroit and the great migration, 1910-1930, and Centennial of the admission of Women to the University of Michigan exhibition. An additional group of online materials and special projects includes exhibit materials created or displayed on the BHL's website from 2001 to 2014. </p>

            <p>The Works of Art: Inventory and Object Files, 1962-2014, bulk 1975-1987 (1 linear foot) are a set of inventory files describing Bentley art objects. Documentation includes Painting Report Forms, catalogue sheet, notes on the piece of artwork and its acquisition, appraisal, artist biography notes and articles, some photographs of the artwork, and some correspondence about the art work. These files were initially created by archivist May Davis Hill and were not maintained after her departure. One file from 2014 details the framed artwork displayed at the Bentley as of that date.</p>

            <p>Included in the Photographs series are images documenting the construction of the BHL and various ceremonies and dedications commemorating the building in the early 1970s, including several interior and exterior views by Balthazar Korab. There are also a number of files of photographs of major exhibits mounted by BHL staff, copy prints and negatives of images used in BHL publications, and informal snapshots of events, visitors and staff. The Audiotapes and Videotapes, Films, DVD's, and Digital Media series document dedications, important meetings and events, and the laying of the cornerstone for the Bentley Library. There are two accessions of Photographs (1967-1998) and (1995-2009) and two accessions of Audiotapes and Videotapes (1971-1991) and 1987-1999).</p>
