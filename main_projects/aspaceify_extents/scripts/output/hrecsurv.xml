        <p>Much of the Michigan Historical Records Survey collection was microfilmed in 1989-1990. Only a portion of the Transcripts of County and Municipal Records were filmed: those which no longer exist anywhere else (whose unique status was discovered in a survey of county and municipal records conducted in 1987). After microfilming, most of the materials were discarded, but a portion of the collection was retained in hard copy: county maps, H.R.S. correspondence, selected W.P.A. project files, and the Inventory of Negro Manuscripts. Oversize architectural drawings, photographs, and non-unique transcripts of government records were not microfilmed. This is finding aid combines the microfilmed and original material. A summary contents list provides an overview of the portions that were filmed and those available only in the original. In the Detailed Contents List section of the finding aid, all microfilmed material is listed as part of a "Roll" and all original material is listed with a box number. In cases where both microfilm and originals are held by the library, the contents list describes the microfilm copy.</p>

      <p>The Historical Records Survey (H.R.S.) was sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.)(known as the Work Projects Administration as of July 1, 1939) from 1935 to 1942. The purpose of the survey was to make unpublished government records and important privately-owned historical materials accessible to government officials, historians, legal scholars, and the general public. It was the largest survey of public records ever conducted in the United States. Luther Evans, the organizer of the Historical Records Survey, stated to a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on Education and Labor, on March 1, 1938, that the Survey's aim was to "build up a second library system in the nation, by making unpublished materials as widely known and readily available...as printed materials now are." He envisioned the H.R.S. being an important part of a "historical renaissance" in the United States and said, "American life will indeed achieve more dignity and richness as we study our past in the only way that it can be studied, that is, in the archives and other materials which the Historical Records Survey makes adequately accessible to us for the first time."</p>
      <p>These lofty goals notwithstanding, in actual fact the Historical Records Survey was a Depression-era project to give jobs to unemployed white-collar workers - teachers, historians, clericals, and others - and, again in the words of Luther Evans, to "rehabilitate them, strengthen their moral fiber, give them renewed hope for the future." The projects upon which these people labored are described herein, followed by a description of the records themselves.</p>
      <p>Although the Historical Records Survey was terminated before all the work that had been envisioned could be completed, what had been accomplished was significant. The program of the H.R.S. was quite broad, encompassing Federal Projects and State Projects. Federal Projects, sponsored and supervised by the H.R.S. at the national level from Washington D.C., included the Survey of Federal Archives (located in the states), Survey of County Records, Survey of Church Records, Manuscripts Survey, American Imprints Survey, Inventory of State Records, Inventory of Municipal Records, American Portraits Survey, Civilian Organizations Survey, Historical Buildings Survey, Maps Survey, Microfilm Survey of Public Records, Naturalization Records Survey, Newspapers Survey, Paintings and Statuaries Survey, Photographs Survey, School Records Survey, Emergency Disposition of Records Survey, and Vital Statistics Survey. State Projects included indexes (of newspapers, deeds, etc.), calendars of manuscript collections, subject-related surveys (e.g., in Michigan, the Inventory of Negro Manuscripts), and transcriptions of government and church records, especially vital statistics and county board of supervisors' minutes.</p>
      <p>The Historical Records Survey was organized by Luther Evans toward the end of 1935. He served as its national director for about four years, until he became the director of the Library of Congress's Legislative Services Division. In 1940 he was succeeded by Sargent Child, who had been a field supervisor since the project's beginning. In Michigan the Survey began in 1936, directed by Assistant State Supervisor Dr. Milo Quaife, secretary and editor of the Detroit Public Library's Burton Historical Collection, and by Associate Supervisor William Jabine. Dr. Quaife retired from the Survey at the end of 1936 and Mr. Jabine became state director until 1939, when he was succeeded by Stuart Portner, who stayed on until the Historical Records Survey came to its premature end in 1942.</p>
      <p>After Federal Project No. 1, of which the H.R.S. was one unit, lost its federal funding in 1939, the Historical Records Survey functioned as a nationwide series of locally-sponsored projects. In Michigan it was sponsored by the State Administrative Board, although the Federal government shared expenses.</p>
      <p>The largest H.R.S. project in Michigan was the Survey of County Records, part of the W.P.A.'s Division of Professional and Service Projects. Field workers inventoried the public records of the counties by locating, describing, and classifying them for future ease of accessibility. In addition they compiled histories of the counties and descriptions of the organization and function of government units. These were to be published, together with the inventories, as guides for each of the 83 counties in Michigan. Although work was done on each county, only a dozen guides were ever published. All of the H.R.S. publications and most of the unpublished materials are housed in the Michigan Historical Collections, located at the Bentley Historical Library. Some other unpublished materials are at the Burton Historical Collection at the Detroit Public Library (see a listing of their holdings in Appendix III of this finding aid).</p>
      <p>The Manuscripts Survey was another important H.R.S. project. Margaret Sherburne was in charge on the national level and Dr. Bernhard Uhlendorf directed the Michigan survey. In 1940 the University of Michigan's Michigan Historical Collections became a cosponsor with the State Administrative Board for the statewide manuscripts survey and for the church records survey, both of whose publications are housed at the Bentley. A Guide to Manuscript Depositories in Michigan, published in 1940, was the first product of the Manuscripts Survey. The guide was produced under the auspices of the W.P.A.'s Division of Professional and Service Projects and included descriptions of the state's libraries, museums, and historical societies and their holdings. The inventory upon which the guide was based was a cooperative effort between Survey staff and the state's librarians and curators. Next came the Guide to Manuscript Collections in Michigan, prepared under the auspices of the W.P.A.'s Division of Community Service Programs (formerly the Division of Professional and Service Projects). Volume 1, an inventory of the Michigan Historical Collections, was issued in 1941 and Volume 2, an inventory of other University of Michigan collections, appeared in 1942. Calendars of two significant collections were published (filed under Historical Records Survey in the library's catalog of printed materials): Calendar of the Baptist Collection of Kalamazoo College, Kalamazoo, Michigan and Calendar of the John C. Dancy Correspondence, 1898-1910 (these are also held by the Library of Michigan and by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - see Appendices II and IV. They also have Vol. 1 of the Guide to Manuscript Collections in Michigan.). Many other private collections never got beyond the inventory stage, but these inventories are also in the H.R.S. collection at the Bentley.</p>
      <p>A significant subject-related manuscript survey was the Inventory of Negro Manuscripts, the brainchild of Dr. Carter G. Woodson. The project was sometimes called the Negro Manuscripts Survey or, in Loretta Heffner's The WPA Historical Records Survey: A Guide to the Unpublished Inventories, Indexes, and Transcripts (Chicago: The Society of American Archivists, 1980), the Survey of Negro Historical Papers. In Michigan it was compiled by the Negro Manuscripts Unit of the Michigan H.R.S. as part of the W.P.A.'s Division of Community Service Programs. Under the direction of Dr. Bernhard Uhlendorf, director of the Manuscripts Survey, the project was organized by Christopher Alston in 1939 and run, after Mr. Alston moved on to other tasks, by historian Robert Hayden. The field workers (all Black) surveyed the Black community in the Detroit metropolitan area and the collections of the Burton Historical Collection at the Detroit Public Library. They searched for original records and papers, both of organizations and of individuals, which would shed light on the social and political history of Blacks in America. In 1941, the Survey published the Calendar of the John C. Dancey Correspondence, 1898-1910. Two other Survey products went unpublished: an essay on Black history in Michigan, attributed to Robert Hayden by Mr. Alston, and a calendar of correspondence discovered in the survey. Copies of the essay and calendar were bound into one volume entitled History of the Negro in Michigan, which is in the Bentley Historical Library, along with the published Dancey calendar and all the unpublished material. Other material relating to Black history can be found in some of the county files, especially Cass County.</p>
      <p>The work of the American Imprints Survey was to document the history of American printing. It was compiled from a survey of thousands of libraries in the U.S., as well as some private collections and historical societies. The survey aimed to list, on a state-by-state basis, all old publications in the United States: books, pamphlets, and broadsides. "Old" meant anything from the beginning of printing through 1876, when copyrighting was introduced (later, for the western states). The Michigan Imprints Survey published Preliminary Check List of Michigan Imprints, 1796-1850 in 1942 under the auspices of the W.P.A.'s Division of Community Service Programs. It is arranged chronologically by year of publication and includes for each Michigan publication a listing of author, title, place of publication, pagination, and locations anywhere in the United States as of the time the survey was conducted. The information gathered was cleared through the National Union Catalog and revealed the existence of many publications which had previously been unknown. Bibliographer Douglas McMurtrie was the national director and Jacques Jean Engerrand was the state supervisor for Michigan. The Bentley Library has the published volume (listed in the printed materials catalog), as well as seven linear feet of notes on all the items discovered in the survey, from which the publication was compiled. These notes are listed in the manuscripts catalog under Michigan Imprints Inventory and cover publications of the years 1796-1876 (note the longer time span).</p>
      <p>The Federal Writers Project commenced in 1935 and operated in many of the counties of the nation. According to a Michigan Writers Project blurb put out by the WPA, the purpose of the project was to "interpret the life, the history, and the local setting of the community to the state and to the nation." This project produced many publications: state and local guides, tour books, folklore and ethnic studies, children's books, and almanacs, many of which are in the Bentley Library. The Michigan Writers Project was transferred to the State WPA in 1939 and writer Harold Titus became state supervisor. The Historical Records Survey was under the Federal Writers Project for a year, so some of their records were interfiled. The Bentley has a few Michigan Writers Project records in the H.R.S. collection.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the WPA Statewide Museums Project was to establish, organize, operate, and improve local museums throughout the state of Michigan, with all that entails. The main sponsor was the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan and cosponsors were the individual museums. Dorothy Myers was consultant and state supervisor of the Museums Project and Dr. Carl Guthe, director of museums at the university and a member of the project's advisory committee, was also very involved with it. Museums in Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Holland, Grand Rapids, Lansing, East Lansing, Port Huron, Alpena, Ann Arbor, and Detroit were all greatly assisted by the program. Although the museums project was separate from the H.R.S., the records that came from the University of Michigan were interfiled with the Michigan H.R.S. material.</p>
      <p>In 1942, when there was no longer a need to provide "make-work" projects because of the "real" work needed for the war effort, the Historical Records Survey was terminated. In Michigan, most of the records of the H.R.S. were given, shortly thereafter, to the Michigan Historical Collections, which was the official cosponsor of the project and the official depository for the H.R.S.'s unpublished materials as well as its publications. Other records were given to the Detroit Public Library's Burton Historical Collection (see Appendix III): 2 boxes of correspondence and reports; 4 boxes of typescript drafts on the following counties: Charlevoix, Chippewa, Clare, Dickinson, Genesee (which did get published), Gogebic, Houghton, Huron, Keweenaw, Lapeer, Macomb, Menominee, Midland, Missaukee, Oakland, St. Clair, and Tuscola; and 22 boxes of correspondence and field forms for the Inventory of Church and Synagogue Archives in Michigan, whose publications, as already mentioned, are housed in the Bentley Historical Library. The State Library of Michigan, in Lansing, has most of the Historical Records Survey's publications (see Appendix II). The State Archives, also in Lansing, has indexes to vital records and listings of WPA enterprises (complete with costs and much other information, very useful for any researcher studying the WPA). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has microfilm copies of many of the H.R.S.'s publications (see Appendix IV). Loretta Hefner compiled The W.P.A. Historical Records Survey: A Guide to the Unpublished Inventories, Indexes, and Transcripts (published by the Society of American Archivists in 1980), which contains additional locations of H.R.S. materials throughout the nation. In addition, the National Archives in Washington D.C. contains a great deal of H.R.S. material, in Record Group 69 (see Appendix V). There is a related collection at the Bentley Library. Since the Michigan Historical Collections was official cosponsor and some of the WPA work was done in it
s offices (as well as having some of its own work done by WPA workers), the Bentley Library also has WPA files in the "University of Michigan. Michigan Historical Collections." archival collection. These consist of correspondence, mostly, in connection with the Michigan Writers Project, the Historical Records Survey, and the Statewide Museums Project.</p>
      <p>Due to its poor quality, much of the paper used in the Historical Records Survey has deteriorated badly over the years. In order to preserve the information contained therein, most of the collection has been microfilmed. Some materials have been preserved in their original form without being filmed and some have been retained after filming, but most of the papers that were filmed have been discarded. This is described in more detail in the following description of the records.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Historical Records Survey record group documents the activities and the product of the legions of depression era workers who inventoried the records held in county courthouses, municipal offices some private repositories. The records include correspondence, drafts of guides to county archives, proceedings of county boards of supervisors, field reports of workers, and copies of land patents for some counties; also material relating to the history of Blacks in Michigan.</p>
      <p>Originally the H.R.S. records transferred to the Michigan Historical Collections measured about 121 linear feet. After processing, the collection consisted of 26 feet of records relating to the H.R.S. and 65 feet of transcripts of county and municipal records. Of the remaining 30 feet, 29.5 feet of duplicate, extraneous, or insignificant materials were discarded (described in more detail further on) and approximately half of a linear foot of printed material was transferred to the library's printed collection.</p>
      <p>The H.R.S. material has been divided into the following series:</p>

          <unittitle>Survey of County Records</unittitle>
        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Survey of County records series, comprising 15 linear feet of material, is arranged alphabetically by county. record types inventoried for each county may include some or all of the following: Correspondence; Historical Material; Historical Material - Government Organization; Inventory of Government Department Holdings; Housing, Care, and Accessibility of Records (which deals with storage and arrangement); Maps (of the counties); and Inventory of Maps in the Counties. The records reflect the fact that the field workers fully researched some counties while paying scant attention to others.</p>
          <p>Correspondence between field workers in the counties and their supervisors in district offices or the state H.R.S. office contains descriptive and historical information about the counties as well as information concerning the workings of the H.R.S. project. In some areas the work went along quite smoothly, but in others the field workers faced numerous difficulties: getting permission to examine government records and to have a place to work, facing officials whose attitude ranged from indifference to outright hostility; attempting to inventory records which were poorly organized and stored in inaccessible places; and even obtaining adequate training and basic office supplies from the WPA Charles Johnson, a field worker in Ionia County, wrote articulately on the workings of the project and his letters make good reading (see roll 13). Three counties - Alger, Ingham, and Marquette - had H.R.S. district supervisors' offices, so their correspondence files contain information about whole regions as well as good descriptions of the project (letters which mentioned only one county have been transferred to that county's files). H.R.S. correspondence is also a source of information about county records. Sometimes it reveals what had happened to records which no longer existed when the survey was conducted and sometimes it is a source of inventory information - in the case of Ingham County the only source, since both the forms and the completed inventory (if there ever was one) are lost. Within each county, correspondence is arranged chronologically and anything of a routine or insignificant nature has been discarded. General instructions, issued to each field worker in the state, have not been retained for each county but only where they were first found in processing and so would tend to be concentrated at the beginning of the alphabetical listing of counties. Any researcher studying the H.R.S. project would want to consult all of the correspondence; therefore, in addition to each county's correspondence being microfilmed with its other material, all the correspondence has been preserved after filming and grouped together, arranged alphabetically by county.</p>
          <p>Historical information is divided into two broad categories: Historical Material for general information and Historical Material - Government Organization (what the H.R.S. called "legal research") for that relating to the government departments. For both, like information has been gathered together and arranged, for the most part, according to the organizational scheme in the H.R.S. published guides.</p>
          <p>For Historical Materials, broad-ranging essays or compilations of information are filed first, followed by specific topics: location, derivation of name, geography and geology, Indian occupation, French penetration, English succession, American emergence, the Territory of Michigan, creation of the county (including copies of early deeds and mortgages), the county seat of justice, first (and usually subsequent) county officers, politics, the circuit court, the courthouse(s) and other early county buildings, the townships, agriculture, the chief city or cities, prominent citizens, business and industry, education, arts, religion, population (including ethnic breakdowns as well as total numbers), special historic and scenic features, transportation (including routes as well as modes), and journalism. Sometimes, previously written guides or parts thereof were used as the basis for new ones, with revisions for the new guide made on a copy of the old one (e.g., Kalamazoo from Alger, Kent from Alger and Calhoun, and others).</p>
          <p>Discarded from the historical materials were: masses of duplicates, including such things as notes that were written up into essays (if the collection contains the essays), rough drafts of published essays (the most advanced draft of an essay was retained if it had not been published, and if duplicates had conflicting or overlapping information, all were saved), and carbon copies; library notes from published works which the Bentley Library has in its collection or which are readily obtained elsewhere, e.g., county histories, censuses, directories, atlases, laws, to name just a few (although if it was too time-consuming to locate the source or if the notes were extremely clear, these notes were retained); information that was irrelevant; and illegible notes.</p>
          <p>Government information was organized by the H.R.S. in two ways: in "legal research" files and in inventories of records held by the various government departments. Survey staff compiled the former in order to write the history of the government organization for each county and to show the workings of each government department. In the current arrangement of the collection, this type of information is called Historical Material - Government Organization. Luther Evans said to a U.S. Senate subcommittee, "It is necessary, if the reader is to understand the relation of each record to the government of the community and to other records, that he have a brief statement of the history, the organization, duties and function of each office of local government, and that he know what legal requirements exist for the keeping of records." The historical material on the government organization is filed separately from the inventory forms (as, indeed, the H.R.S. workers handled it, until it was brought together to produce a published guide), but both obviously cover the same departments: Board of Supervisors, County Clerk, Register of Deeds, Superintendent of Abstracts/Abstract Department, Circuit Court, Circuit Court Commissioners, Friend of the Court, Jury Commission, Probation Officer, Probate Court, Probate Judge's Office, Juvenile Probation Officer, Sheriff, Concealed Weapon Licensing Board, Coroner, Prosecuting Attorney, Tax Allocation Board/Bureau of Taxation, County Treasurer, Controller, County Auditors, Sinking Fund, School Commissioner, Board of School Examiners, County Health Department/Board of Health, County Nurse, Superintendents of the Poor/Poor Commission, County Welfare Agent, Social Welfare Board/Department of Social Welfare/Bureau of Social Aid, Soldiers' Relief Commission, Board of Election Commissioners, Board of Canvassers, Road Commission, Drain Commissioner, County Plat Board, Surveyor, Board of Park Trustees/Parks Department, Sealer of Weights and Measures, Agricultural Agent, Humane Office, Dog Warden, and Game Warden. (n.b., no county had all of these departments, and sometimes there was historical information on a department but no inventory, or vice versa.)</p>
          <p>Inventories of Government Department Holdings were recorded on Volume and Unbound Record Forms (12-13HR). These provide a wealth of information about the records: the title of the record series, inclusive dates, location and storage conditions, labeling, quantity, contents, arrangement and indexing, physical description of volumes, and more. Field workers would fill out one form for each type of record found and send the forms to the central editorial board in Detroit, where archivists and historians directed the editing. In reviewing these forms, the editors frequently had questions or wanted more information. They wrote their questions and comments on "rejection slips", which they then attached to the forms in question and returned to the workers for correction or completion. For accuracy, everything was rechecked. Usually, new information was added to the original forms, making the rejection slips redundant. These slips have been discarded. But if the information was written on the rejection slip instead of the form, both have been saved. Along with superfluous rejection slips, other unneeded items have been discarded as well: blank forms, superseded forms, and duplicates. Sometimes two or even three workers conducted their own separate inventories of the same records and in these cases the most complete form has been saved for each record. When a typed form accompanied a handwritten one, the most legible one has been retained, usually the typed one. There is undoubtedly some duplication still, for sometimes copies of the same records were found in more than one department and were inventoried in both places (for example, numerous departments would file copies of certain records with the county clerk's office and still retain their originals).</p>
          <p>Both in the original survey and in its current form, arrangement was done at the folder level, with (in most cases) each government department having its own folder. The Survey workers assembled the forms for each department but usually did not put them in any particular order (that would come later, when it was time to publish the inventory). This original order has been retained. If there were very few inventory forms for a given county, they have all been placed in one folder and their departments not itemized in the contents list beyond the "Inventory of Government Department Holdings" listing.</p>
          <p>Housing, Care, and Accessibility of Records (or H.C.A.) was the heading the H.R.S. gave to their description if the storage and arrangement of records. It deals with the way the workers found the records or, if they were conscientious and industrious, the way they themselves organized them if the county officials gave them permission to improve their arrangement. Here the inventory was done by building and by room within a building, using Form 10HR, which was either the County Building Form or the Office or Vault Form. The County Building Form gives the address and location of the building, describes its physical attributes, and tells some of its history. The Office or Vault Form lists the government department to which the records belong; the location of the room within the building; storage conditions such as overcrowding, lighting, ventilation, and fire safety; and the quantity of bound and unbound records. Sometimes the County Building Form contains very detailed information about the buildings where the records were stored, both physical and historical, accompanied by diagrams of floor plans and building facades. An extreme example of this is Saginaw County, where even the fixtures in the bathrooms were described. Usually there was not much duplication, but if the information on the forms had been written into an essay, either published or unpublished, the forms have been discarded. Oversized floor plans and architectural drawings were not microfilmed and are filed alphabetically by county. Smaller ones have been retained in addition to being filmed and are interfiled with the others. Photographs of courthouses and some other early buildings have also been preserved. Researchers interested in the history or architecture of such buildings should consult these folders, the courthouse section of the Historical Material files, and the H.C.A. files. The transcripts of Board of Supervisors' minutes are another source of information on county buildings.</p>
          <p>There are two files dealing with maps. The first, Maps, consists of maps of the counties drawn by H.R.S. workers on letter-size paper in preparation for publication in the guide for each county. Oftentimes there is a map of Michigan with the given county highlighted to show its location, followed by several maps of that county in varying levels of detail, drawn with some care, frequently in color. The best representative sample of each has been retained, with all duplicates discarded. After filming, these maps have been preserved and grouped together, arranged alphabetically by county. In addition, there are a few maps, too large to microfilm or not really related to the H.R.S., which have been removed to the Bentley Library's map collection.</p>
          <p>The second file, Inventory of Maps in the County describes the maps that H.R.S. workers found in the counties. They used Form 15HR, the Maps and Photographs Form, to describe each map in some detail, noting features such as date, size, title or subject, area covered, scale, type of map, artist or author, publisher, place of publication, physical condition, location, and the name of the government department to which it belonged. H.R.S. workers inventoried an unusually large number of maps in Houghton and Keweenaw Counties.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Survey of municipal Records (a little over six linear feet of material) covers the same types of information as that of the counties, with the exception of maps; there were no special maps drawn and none inventoried. The offices of county government have their counterparts at the municipal level, with some differences. Those offices for which inventories are available include: Mayor, City Manager, Common Council, City Clerk, Recorder, Recorder's Court, Justices of the Peace, City/Municipal Court, Common Pleas Court, Probate Court, Treasurer, Comptroller/Controller, Sinking Fund Commission, Corporation Counsel, Police Department, Fire Department, Department/Board of Public Works, Water Department, Department of Building Safety and Engineering, Plumbing Inspector, Electric Light Inspector, Public Lighting Commission, City Assessors/Board of Assessors, Auditor General, Board of Health/Health Department, City Attorney, Board of Education, City Surveyor, Public Library, Sealer of Weights and Measures, Department of Parks and Recreation/Board of Park Commissioners/Department of Parks and Boulevards, Street Department/Superintendent of Streets, Department of Street Railways, City Engineer, Purchasing Agent/Department, Planning Commission, Election Commission, Welfare Department, Civil Service Commission, City Chemist, Ways and Means Commission, Board of Review, Board of Estimates, and Bridge Commission. The original order of these records has been retained, except for some relating to Detroit. Forms for old records of the Detroit City Clerk's Office, Controller's Office, Treasurer's Office, Common Council, and Department of Public Works were filed by H.R.S. workers under "Municipal Garage", where they had been stored and subsequently inventoried. Many of the records were later sent to the Detroit Public Library or destroyed. Their inventory forms have now been filed according to the departments which created them.</p>
          <p>Only a few municipalities were researched as separate entities, beyond the "chief city" requirements for the county files: Alpena, Battle Creek, Bay City, Charlotte, Cheboygan, Detroit, Escanaba, Grand Rapids, Hamtramck, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Marquette, Menominee, Muskegon, and Port Huron. The criteria for saving or discarding materials were the same as for the county files. Researchers interested in a particular city should check the county files as well as these. They should also consult the transcripts of municipal records, which include council proceedings, local ordinances, and some other types of records (see contents list).</p>

          <p>The Survey of Federal Records series is a tiny part of the H.R.S. collection, consisting of only two categories of unpublished records (and a couple of inches of linear shelf space): Field Agencies of the Federal Government and Directory of Buildings and Rooms Containing Federal Archives. The former gives brief profiles of agencies and their records, but does not include inventories. Several inventories had been published and are in the Bentley Library's printed collection. Volumes on the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Works Progress Administration, and the Post Office had been prepared for publication; these have been bound and treated as separate entities in the printed collection. The Directory of Buildings and Rooms Containing Federal Archives was also ready for publication, but is now so outdated that it would no longer be accurate and so has been microfilmed but not bound.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Survey of State Records series is also very small (less than a linear foot), containing the histories and/or inventories of only six agencies: Administrative Board, Auditor General, Conservation Department, State Board of Health, Judicial Circuits, and Liquor Control Commission. As with historical information in the county and municipal files, notes from sources readily available or better consulted elsewhere have been discarded. Only the most advanced form of an essay has been retained and the original order of the inventory forms has been preserved.</p>

          <p>The WPA Project Files comprise about one and one-half linear feet of material and consist of correspondence, official bulletins, descriptions of projects, instructions to workers, lists of workers, project proposals, work reports, and lists of publications for the following projects (though not all for each): Historical Records Survey, Statewide Museums Project, National Youth Administration (whose workers assisted in both of these projects), Art Program, American Imprints Inventory of Michigan, and Michigan Writers Project. Also included are the files of the Survey of Civilian Organizations in Ann Arbor, which consists of forms filled out on each of the large number of groups that were active then. Much was discarded in the processing of the WPA Project Files: insignificant or routine correspondence, trivial work reports, and the ever-present duplicates. A few items relating to the Historical Records Survey and the Statewide Museums Project have been retained but not microfilmed (see contents list).</p>

This unpublished group of records supplements the published Guide to Manuscript Depositories in the United States - Michigan, issued by the H.R.S. in 1940. Material discarded from this subseries included duplicates, routine correspondence, trivial reports, and illegible notes.</p>

            <p>The Survey of Private Collections subseries, comprising two linear feet of material, consists of inventories (and sometimes transcripts and/or translations) of manuscripts, genealogies, newspapers, printed material, scrapbooks and newspaper clippings, deeds, birth records, and army discharges - a genealogical gold mine. These records had been arranged roughly by type and then by county within that classification, but with a lot of overlapping. During processing, this arrangement scheme was changed so that all types of records are now grouped together by county.</p>

          <p>The Inventory of Negro Manuscripts (comprising less than a linear foot of material) also contains a great deal of genealogical information. There are biographies (see the contents list for itemization) and inventories of private collections (sometimes with transcripts), including manuscripts, books, photographs, newspaper articles, and talks given. The H.R.S. workers sometimes filed these materials according to who produced them and sometimes according to who owned them at the time of the inventory, a system that might lead to some confusion but which has been retained.</p>
          <p>The biographies and the inventories of collections make up the bulk of this record subgroup, but in addition there are descriptions of the survey project; a bibliography; an essay entitled "History of the Negro in Michigan", attributed to Robert Hayden and similar to the one bound into the unpublished volume of the same name mentioned earlier; and transcripts of papers, complementing those published in the calendar section of that book. Discarded were duplicates and early drafts of essays, drafts of the published Calendar of the John C. Dancy Correspondence, 1898-1910 and the unpublished calendar, inventory forms for items listed in the calendar, and library notes taken from standard biographical sources. The Inventory of Negro Manuscripts has been preserved in manuscript form as well as on microfilm. (see Box 45 for original documents)</p>

          <p>The Transcripts of County Records series consists of transcripts and abstracts of county board of supervisors minutes and of selected village/city council minutes, with the addition, in a few cases, of other types of records as well. Sometimes, there was more than one chronology of what was essentially the same thing, transcribed or abstracted slightly differently by different field workers. Only a portion of the transcribed county records have been microfilmed. A complete listing of all the transcripts, both on microfilm and hard copy, follows the listing of the contents of roll 68</p>

          <p>The series Maps, consists of maps of the counties drawn by H.R.S. workers on letter-size paper in preparation for publication in the guide for each county. Oftentimes there is a map of Michigan with the given county highlighted to show its location, followed by several maps of that county in varying levels of detail, drawn with some care, frequently in color. The best representative sample of each has been retained, with all duplicates discarded. After filming, these maps have been preserved and grouped together, arranged alphabetically by county. In addition, there are a few maps, too large to microfilm or not really related to the H.R.S., which have been removed to the Bentley Library's map collection.</p>

          <p>The Historical Records Survey Correspondence series consists of correspondence between field workers in the counties and their supervisors in district offices or the state H.R.S. office contains descriptive and historical information about the counties as well as information concerning the workings of the H.R.S. project. In some areas the work went along quite smoothly, but in others the field workers faced numerous difficulties: getting permission to examine government records and to have a place to work, facing officials whose attitude ranged from indifference to outright hostility; attempting to inventory records which were poorly organized and stored in inaccessible places; and even obtaining adequate training and basic office supplies from the W.P.A. Charles Johnson, a field worker in Ionia County, wrote articulately on the workings of the project and his letters make good reading (see Roll 13). Three counties - Alger, Ingham, and Marquette - had H.R.S. district supervisors' offices, so their correspondence files contain information about whole regions as well as good descriptions of the project (letters which mentioned only one county have been transferred to that county's files). H.R.S. correspondence is also a source of information about county records. Sometimes it reveals what had happened to records which no longer existed when the survey was conducted and sometimes it is a source of inventory information - in the case of Ingham County the only source, since both the forms and the completed inventory (if there ever was one) are lost. Within each county, correspondence is arranged chronologically and anything of a routine or insignificant nature has been discarded. General instructions, issued to each field worker in the state, have not been retained for each county but only where they were first found in processing and so would tend to be concentrated at the beginning of the alphabetical listing of counties. Any researcher studying the H.R.S. project would want to consult all of the correspondence; therefore, in addition to each county's correspondence being microfilmed with its other material, all the correspondence has been preserved after filming and grouped together, arranged alphabetically by county.</p>

        <head>1987 Survey of Records of Records in Counties and Municipalities</head>
        <p>In 1987 the Bentley Library conducted a survey of the counties and municipalities whose transcripts of government records were included in the H.R.S. collection. It revealed that most of the originals still exist in their home locales, but some have been lost, burned, or discarded, leaving the library with probably the only extant copies of those records. Although the bulk of the transcripts (55 linear feet of material in 44 Paige boxes) will remain as they are, the unique ones (10 linear feet) have been microfilmed. Most of the counties of Michigan are represented, as well as fifteen municipalities (see contents list). All are valuable sources of historical information.</p>
