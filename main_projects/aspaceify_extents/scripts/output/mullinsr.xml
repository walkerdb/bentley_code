    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Raymond G. Mullins is an attorney and community leader in Ypsilanti, Michigan. He has long been active in numerous civic and professional organizations, including trustee of the Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church. For two decades, Mullins was instrumental in garnering broad support for the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Under his leadership, the Ypsilanti and Willow Run branches merged, memberships more than doubled, the branch opened an office, youth programs thrived, and the organization won several awards at the national level for programming excellence.</p>
      <p>Born in Detroit in 1943, Mullins grew up in Ypsilanti. After graduation from Ypsilanti High School, he studied economics and labor law at Howard University, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1965. From 1966 to 1970, he served as an officer in the United States Air Force. Following honorable discharge, Mullins returned to Michigan to earn a law degree in 1973 at the University of Michigan. Since then he has practiced law in Ypsilanti and was a judicial candidate for the Washtenaw County Circuit Court in 1992.</p>
      <p>During the early 1970s, Mullins was a leading force in integrating Perry School, the last segregated school in the city of Ypsilanti, becoming involved with the NAACP soon after opening his law practice in 1974. Active in branch committee work throughout the seventies, including membership, public relations, and education, he brought in new members, raised funds, and increased visibility for the organization by also working at the state level. Mullins served as president from 1981 to 1982 and again from 1987 to 1998. At the heart of his leadership was the belief that NAACP membership should include a cross section of the community -- business leaders, politicians, chamber of commerce members, area ministers. He worked to build a biracial organization and for community-wide response, all but abandoning his law practice after taking the helm. Tackling both controversial and popular issues, Mullins led initiatives in employment and education, stressed the need for children to know and understand their heritage, and encouraged political involvement. It was during his tenure, for example, that advocacy geared toward integrating a previously all-white judiciary in Washtenaw County met with success.</p>
      <p>Mullins also built bonds in the community through his participation in Brown Chapel A.M.E. outreach, particularly in promoting and working for the annual Brotherhood Banquet. Originally initiated in 1953, when racial tensions were high, this annual event continues to bring people from across the region together to rededicate themselves to the cause of racial and religious goodwill and tolerance. In 1991 at that event, Mullins received the Service Award from Brown Chapel. The prior year he was named Man of the Year by Detroit's Minority Women's Network and won the Community Involvement Award from the Ypsilanti Chamber of Commerce.</p>
      <p>Although Mullins retired from the presidency of NAACP in 1998, he continues to carry on a family tradition of community involvement, even as he directs more of his energy toward his law practice. Both of his parents believed it was important to give something back to the community. In that tradition, and in their honor, Mullins established the Glenn and Laura L. Mullins Community Foundation, designed to advance educational opportunities for minority students.</p>

          <p>The Political and Professional series (1.5 linear feet) includes biographical material such as resumes and newspaper articles about Mullins, material documenting his 1992 judgeship candidacy, and correspondence. Also part of this series are several files covering the Fulton Eaglin campaign in 1994 to succeed William Ford in Congress. (Eaglin lost in the primary to Lynn Rivers.)</p>
          <p>Researchers interested in his legal career will find the candidacy files of interest, particularly the photocopy of the completed State Bar of Michigan questionnaire and the letters of support. There are also folders concerning legal organizations Mullins was involved in, including the Vanzetti M. Hamilton Bar Association, Washtenaw County Bar Association, Washtenaw County Black Bar Association, and the Ypsilanti Bar Association. Another item of interest involving Mullin's legal career is the By-Laws and stock certificate of his practice. Finally, the series includes Mullin's Business Expansion Plan.</p>
          <p>The series also contains a section entitled "Personalities" which is organized by the name of the person Mullins associated with and/or about whom he collected information. These files primarily contain newspaper clippings; however some also include correspondence, resumes, event invitations, and biographical information. For example, the folder for Congressman Bill Ford contains correspondence between Ford and Mullins, along with invitations to events. Many of the people included are figures in the Ypsilanti community. Others are state and national figures. Of particular interest are autographed collectors cards of Muhammad Ali. Together, these files create a profile of contemporaries that may have influenced Mullin's work.</p>
          <p>The miscellaneous folder contains President Shelton's (of Eastern Michigan University) remarks at a 1992 Board of Regents meeting. It also contains a newsletter of the Unity Church of Inkster and Mullin's nomination for the Martin Luther King I Have a Dream Award.</p>

          <p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People series is mainly comprised of NAACP papers and clippings dating from 1974 to 1992. (Photocopied material includes some earlier dates.) Documents in folders Mullins labeled "Memorabilia" include education committee papers regarding desegregation in Ypsilanti schools, state conference activities, news clippings and an occasional copy of meeting minutes. Also of note is a folder with a brief historical sketch and photocopied articles on the history of the organization. Among the later is a July 1919 reprint from <title render="italic">Crisis Magazine</title> which discussed NAACP recruiting in the midwest. Ypsilanti experiences are featured, along with Detroit, Cleveland, and other industrial cities. The series also holds letters to Congressman William Ford urging that a national holiday be declared to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. and a collection of programs and clippings from Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations. The photographs are of Mullins with Muhammad Ali in 1992 and Don Riegle in 1993, both autographed.</p>

          <p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People series (1.5 linear feet and 842 KB) is comprised mainly of events that they organized and meeting materials. Documents in folders Mullins labeled "Memorabilia" include education committee papers regarding desegregation in Ypsilanti schools, state conference activities, news clippings and an occasional copy of meeting minutes. Also of note is a folder with a brief historical sketch and photocopied articles on the history of the organization. Among the later is a July 1919 reprint from <title render="italic">Crisis Magazine</title> which discussed NAACP recruiting in the Midwest. Ypsilanti experiences are featured, along with Detroit, Cleveland, and other industrial cities. The series also holds letters to Congressman William Ford urging that a national holiday be declared to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. and a collection of programs and clippings from Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations. The photographs are of Mullins with Muhammad Ali in 1992 and Don Rieglie in 1993, both autographed.</p>
          <p>The series also contains materials of the Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological, Scientific Olympics (ACT-So) competition. There are balance sheets, correspondence, fliers, grant applications, a news article, and programs about the event. Events that have limited material, including the Radioathon and C. Eugene Beatty Golf Classic, are included in the "miscellaneous events" folder. The individual event folders contain correspondence about the event, fliers, and meeting minutes.</p>
          <p>A folder that may hold particular interest is the "officer elections" folder, which includes a list of officers for election in 1994 and nomination forms from the 1990 election.</p>
          <p>A significant portion of the collection is comprised of meeting materials. In order to maintain the original order of the collection, the executive and general membership meetings have been grouped together. Meeting materials include notes, agendas, minutes, brochures, reports (treasurer, finance, and presidential reports), and sign in sheets. Assuming that they were distributed during meetings, fliers and brochures were kept in their original order and filed with the meeting materials.</p>
          <p>Another large part of the series is membership information and includes membership lists from different committees and years.</p>

          <p>The Organization Affiliations series (0.75 linear feet) includes papers, newspaper clippings, and publications from the many organizations Mullins was active in. Organizations include religious, political, legal, and community groups, with an emphasis on African American groups. Mullins was involved with local fraternities and sororities, including Omega Psi Phi, Sigma Rho Chapter and Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Psi Omega Chapter. There are folders in the series that contain fliers of events Mullins participated in and attended that were held by these organizations.</p>
          <p>The series also contains information on Loyal Opposition to the Status Quo, of which Mullins was the President and founder. This section contains an article written by Mullins, an agenda, history of the organization, budget, calendar, and a member list.</p>
          <p>The Miscellaneous community events and organizations folders contain brochures and programs of multiple events and organizations. Mullins relationships with these organizations are unknown. However, these organizations may have been affiliated with his own in some way since many of them concern social issues in Washtenaw County.</p>
          <p>Finally, the series contains correspondence, an organizational chart, fliers, and minutes of the Glenn and Laura L. Mullins Community Foundation, Inc. Mullins served as the President of this organization.</p>
