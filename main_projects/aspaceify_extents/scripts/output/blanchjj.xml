      <p>James J. Blanchard, the first Democratic governor of Michigan in twenty years, won the 1982 gubernatorial election over Richard Headlee with a plurality of less than 200,000 out of three million votes cast. When Blanchard took office, the state faced its gravest economic challenges since the depression: slumping auto sales pushed unemployment over 17%, while diminishing the state's tax base; a $1.7 billion deficit loomed and finances were further straitened when the state's credit rating was downgraded; outmigration of educated and skilled workers threatened the human capital of Michigan. Working with his cabinet, public and private sector leaders, and members of the legislature, Blanchard righted Michigan's finances, upgraded the state's credit rating, and launched an aggressive economic development program to diversify Michigan's economy and provide jobs for its citizens.</p>
      <p>Among the recovery programs set in motion by Blanchard were: the establishment of the Michigan Youth Corps, a program which created 40,000 jobs for young people; installing a public works project which provided 50,000 jobs dedicated to improving the state's infrastructure; the formation of the Governor's Commission on Jobs and Economic Development, a coalition of business, labor, education, and government leaders; adoption of a zero-growth state budget and an unpopular temporary income tax increase; and development of an aggressive plan to protect the environment, especially the Great Lakes. By 1985, the state had turned the corner on the worst of its economic problems, achieving solvency by November and consequently having Michigan's credit upgraded to the best among American states. The Blanchard administration credited its own efforts for spurring this economic recovery.</p>
      <p>Blanchard campaigned in 1986 on the theme, "Michigan, the Comeback State." He easily defeated challenger, William Lucas, winning over 68% over the votes cast. Backed by this mandate, Blanchard embarked on a more ambitious agenda of reform. This broader program included, but was by no means limited to: strengthening the state's finances, innovation and integrity in public policy, improving education, preserving the right of choice for women, protecting children and families, and being tough on criminals. The Michigan Strategic Fund is an apt example of innovative policy designed to provide capital for small businesses and to diversify the state economy. Education was a top priority for Blanchard, and his second term saw the development of a broad array of education initiatives: the Michigan Education Trust, a state-supported guaranteed tuition program; the Research Excellence Fund, state-financed research in new technologies; the Michigan Model Health Curriculum, an ambitious effort to educate all students on good health habits; and the Michigan Opportunity Card, a surety of competence offered by the Cabinet Council on Human Investment. Michigan hosted several conferences on environmental issues as it attended to preventive and palliative measures to preserve the region's ecology. Blanchard created the post of Citizens' Protection Advisor to secure Michiganders' rights. All these efforts reveal the activist bent of the Blanchard administration.</p>
      <p>Blanchard came to the office of governor at a propitious moment, a time when states were taking up responsibilities shunted by the federal government. Reagan's New Federalism accelerated the shifting of powers and duties to state and local agencies, a trend initiated by Nixon's revenue sharing. Blanchard brought an apt philosophy to this situation. Blanchard described himself as, "of the new breed of governors: innovative, flexible, global in outlook and unafraid to challenge the status quo." These attributes served him well in meeting the needs of the Michigan citizenry and economy. His administration was pragmatic, fiscally conservative, and acted within the parameters of the possible. Blanchard shunned adherence to ideology, save the ideal that governments can, and should, act to benefit people. These traits were apparent in his administrative legacy.</p>
      <p>Immediately before winning his first gubernatorial term in the 1982 election, Blanchard served in the United States Congress for four terms representing several Detroit suburbs. While in Congress, he won acclaim for his work in shaping the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Act, an act which saved thousands of Michigan jobs. Blanchard's service to the people of Michigan began in 1968 as legal advisor to the Michigan Secretary of State. In 1969, he became an Assistant Attorney General and served in that capacity for five years before being elected to Congress.</p>
      <p>James Blanchard was born in Detroit on August 8, 1942. He earned a B.A. and M.B.A. from Michigan State University and a law degree from the University of Minnesota. Blanchard married Paula Parker in June 1966; they had one son, Jay, in 1971. The Blanchards were divorced in 1987. James Blanchard married Janet Fox in the fall of 1989. After failing to win a third term as governor, Blanchard repaired to a private legal practice. He served as ambassador to Canada in the Clinton administration and ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor in 2002.</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <p>The arrangement scheme for the Blanchard papers is predicated on a primary dividing principle which established series linked to offices within the executive office of the governor. The series created by this scheme are arranged alphabetically by name of office. The researcher should also note that, within each of the series, the materials are arranged in a manner designed to retain, as far as practicable, their original order. In some cases this order revealed remarkable similarities in filing practices; staff in the Correspondence Office and Deputy Chief of Staff used systems which divided materials into two runs: departmental and issues-topical. Where original order was obscure or attenuated, the materials were arranged to facilitate research and accessibility of information. This necessitated rearranging materials from the Legal Office and the Chief of Staff to conform to the department and issues-topical bifurcation present in related files. Significant rearrangement was also undertaken within the Issues and Press Office series.</p>

      <p>James J. Blanchard, as Governor of Michigan, was the chief executive of the state. He was vested with the power to execute the laws of the state and to issue executive orders. He supervised the nineteen departments of the executive branch, ran the executive office of the governor, and appointed members to state boards and commissions. The governor submitted messages to the state legislature and recommended measures considered necessary or desirable; in short, Blanchard set a legislative agenda. A key element of this agenda were the annual state budgets submitted to the legislature, recommending revenues to meet proposed expenditures. Although Blanchard had the power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, he exercised this power with care. Blanchard also was empowered to seek extraditions and issue warrants on fugitives from justice. Finally, as governor, Blanchard was the commander-in-chief of the state's armed forces. In addition to these roles defined by law, custom, and practice, Blanchard used the governorship as a platform from which to champion Michigan.</p>
      <p>In the course of completing the many tasks inhering in the office of governor, Blanchard and his executive office created and reviewed a welter of written documents. These records and papers provide an important source documenting the executive actions for the years of Blanchard's tenure, 1983-1990. Many are in the departmental files at the State Archives. This collection of papers at the Bentley Library constitutes that portion of executive documentation which Blanchard, upon leaving office, decreed personal in accordance with the traditional practice of recent governors of Michigan.</p>
      <p>The materials came from geographically distinct offices (Lansing, Detroit, Upper Peninsula, and Washington), reflected the efforts of staff ranging from policy analysts to Blanchard himself, and were preserved in varying degrees of completeness. Among these records and papers retained are: correspondence, budgets, memoranda, reports, briefing books, minutes and agenda, press releases and public statements, legal briefs and decisions, legislative bills and analyses, clippings, photographs, audiotapes, and videotapes. These materials were especially strong in documenting the Blanchard administration's investment in human capital and education, efforts to promote economic development and create jobs, interest in rebuilding Michigan's infrastructure while preserving and restoring its environmental beauty, and generally reflecting its commitment to act to promote the commonweal. The collection sheds some light on affirmative action, citizens' protection, criminal justice, the Michigan Youth Corps, and attitudes of Michigan residents as reflected in letters to the governor. The collection is weak in its coverage of Blanchard's private life and his activities related to the Democratic party.</p>
      <p>Researchers should note that Blanchard's executive office was not a rule-bound operation, restricted by strict adherence to hierarchical functions. There was considerable sharing of responsibilities, especially at the higher levels of the administration. One finds that roles filled by a chief of staff sometimes devolved to an executive assistant or to a staff member in the Legal or Government Relations Office. Work on large recurring projects, like the budget or the state of the state address, involved participation at many levels cutting across offices. Day to day functions, like responding to issue-oriented constituent correspondence, often entailed action by the chief of staff, counsel, or a policy analyst from the Washington Office, in addition to the expected responses from the Issues and Correspondence Offices. These sorts of overlap are noted when appropriate in the finding aid.</p>
      <p>The Chief of Staff had the primary responsibility for seeing to the efficient functioning of the executive office of the Governor. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Chief of Staff interacted with nearly every department in the executive branch of state government and with each unit within the executive office. The Chief of Staff served as a sort of gatekeeper for the Governor, apprising him of significant issues, informing him of how best to respond, and judging how effectively the response meets the issue. During Blanchard's two terms in office, he was served by four Chiefs of Staff: F. Thomas Lewand, Phillip Jourdan, Rick Cole, and Steve Weiss. Records are extant from each chief except Rick Cole; these range from the thin but rich records of Lewand to the more fulsome materials of Jourdan and Weiss.</p>
      <p>The efforts of the Chief of Staff to facilitate frictionless functioning of state governance were augmented by able deputies, competent staff, and a cadre of Executive Assistants. Chief among these assistants were Nancy Austin-Schwartz, Bill Liebold, Carolyn Sparks, and Ron Thayer. Given that the Blanchard administration was democratic and decidedly non-hierarchical, these Executive Assistants often filled roles similar to the Chiefs of Staff. At these highest levels of administration, decisions were made and actions taken without much regard to hierarchy or job description strictures. In this free market of ideas and ability, whoever had the best idea or was best able to handle a situation attended to it. Sometimes this was the chief, sometimes one of the assistants, but just as often things were handled by other members of the executive office staff or by someone from an executive department.</p>
      <p>The Correspondence Office was that division within the Executive Office which received, routed, and responded to constituent correspondence. In handling this task, staff in the Correspondence Office worked closely with the Issues Development Office, with head of executive branch departments, and with the Office Operations Division. Mail received by the unit was directed to specialists in Issues Development, to the appropriate state department, to the Governor's personal attention, or handled with a standard response. Given the volume of mail directed to the Governor's attention (at times reaching thousands of pieces per week) and its issues-oriented nature, one should not be surprised to find that most mail sparked a standard response. The bulk of the materials saved reflects the office's efforts to individually address constituent concerns in a timely fashion. This work originally was the domain of an autonomous Communications Unit, fell to the correspondence unit within the Operations Division for a time, until finally it was established as a separate office. Donna Kaufman oversaw this unit from 1983 until 1988 when Patrick Casey took charge.</p>
      <p>The Government Relations Office was the unit which tracked the Governor's legislative agenda and the executive branch's reaction to bills coming out of the legislature. The Government Relations Office served as the Governor's interface with the Michigan House and Senate. In fulfilling this mission, the office had to rely upon the advice and consent of many within the executive office, specifically the Legal Division and the Issues Office (especially the intergovernmental relations unit). This reliance on diverse input was evident in Blanchard's first term as the Legal/ Legislative/Government Relations functions were all met by a single office, headed by Conrad Mallet, Jr. There exists little to document Mallet's tenure as head of this office, aside from transition files and enrolled house and senate bills. During Blanchard's second term the legislative functions fell to separate government relations, legal, and issues offices which then maintained a close working relationship. Stan Fedewa, and later, William Kandler, directed the work of the Government Relations Office at this time. The efforts of both of these men are well reflected in the extant materials.</p>
      <p>The Issues Development Office was charged with delineating, articulating and disseminating the official Blanchard position on the topics of the day. These functions, central to the administration, insured that the issues office would be integral to the executive office. This is manifest in the myriad array of units heavily reliant on the Issues Development Office for their own operations; the Chief of Staff, Executive Assistants, Correspondence, Government Relations, Legal, and Press Offices all were in daily contact with Issues. Within the Issues Development Office, responsibilities were divided among analysts according to issue: agriculture, education, environment, human services, local government, and urban affairs. These analysts reported to the office manager, who in turn reported to the Deputy Chief of Staff, who checked that positions were consistent with the policy goals of the administration.</p>
      <p>The Issues Development Office eventually came to house the papers of the Local Government Advisor. Connie Shorter was the senior staff member responsible for local government affairs and she moved with the unit from its original home in the Policy Department, through the Government Relations Office, back to Issues. The office also served as aegis for special projects ranging from the Cabinet Council on Human Investment, to Citizens' Protection, to the Public Investment Task Force. The issues office itself underwent numerous name changes over the years, beginning as the Policy Office, then to Planning and Program Development, before settling on Issues Development in 1987. In whatever guise, under whatever name, this office remained poised to build Blanchard's stance on any issue.</p>
      <p>The Legal Division dealt with the many legal problems arising out of running a state government. These include, but are not limited to, issues related to administrative rules, bonds, local charters, corrections, crime, pardons, extraditions, legislation, and protection of civil rights. This rather broad array of issues eventually proved too disparate to be capably handled by the relatively small legal staff, so some duties were shunted to the Government Relations and Issues Offices. As with the government relations materials above, there are no materials from Conrad Mallet, Jr.'s tenure. Materials relating to administrative and emergency rules, bonds, local charters, pardons, and extraditions have not been retained with this collection; they are retained by the State Archives. What has been retained from the Legal Division are the papers of Mike Hodge, Legal Advisor and Special Counsel to the Governor from 1987 to 1990. Hodge's papers superbly document the legal concerns facing Blanchard during his second term.</p>
      <p>The Operations Division's primary function within the Blanchard administration was scheduling the Governor's out-of-office events. This entailed handling the thousands of invitations for the Governor to appear, deciding which of these events merited Blanchard's presence, making local arrangements with the advance team, briefing Blanchard on the hot-button issues, and serving as liaison between local contacts and the executive office. Jill Pennington capably directed the scheduling unit for both of Blanchard's terms as governor. During one of the periodic reorganizations of the executive office, the Operations Division oversaw the correspondence unit and a speakers bureau. Both of these proved to be outside the scope of the scheduling mission and were dealt out of operations' hand in the next office restructuring. The division remained committed to placing a prepared Blanchard before congenial forums.</p>
      <p>The Personnel Division was charged with filling all appointive positions in the executive and judicial branches of state government. These positions include all executive posts on boards, commissions, task forces and the executive office, as well as all court posts ranging from courts of appeals, to district courts, to the State Supreme Court. The Personnel Division was initially headed up by Ron Thayer. Shelby Solomon next ran the office. The papers related to personnel division during the tenure of both of these men was not forwarded with the Blanchard collection. All that remains are the papers of Gregory Morris, director of the division from 1987 to 1990. The materials Morris retained dealt exclusively with Blanchard's judicial appointments from 1983 to 1990. This narrow, but very important, stratum of information remains the only evidence on how and who Blanchard chose to extend his program.</p>
      <p>The Press Office presented the public face for the Blanchard administration. This office coordinated press conferences, released policy statements and copies of Blanchard's speeches, arranged photo opportunities, mediated with local and state media, and generally put the best possible spin on the administration. The Press Office was the single point of fixity in the field of flux that was the Blanchard executive office. This office fell under the eye of only two directors, Rick Cole and Tom Scott, during the two gubernatorial terms. Scott was with the office almost from the outset and is largely responsible for the retention of much of the materials. He treated the Press Office as the archives of the executive office, saving newspaper clippings, press releases, speeches, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs which document the public life of Blanchard. These materials provide the most comprehensive picture of Blanchard as politician, statesman, governor.</p>
      <p>The Upper Peninsula Office was one of the regional offices established by the executive office to better serve a specific clientele, in this case the residents of the upper peninsula. This office brought the services of state government to the more immediate attention of upper peninsula citizens. It answered constituent correspondence, served as liaison between county officials and the state, and briefed the Governor for his trips to the upper peninsula. In short the Upper Peninsula Office provided a scaled-down version of the outreach functions offered by the executive office. Tom Baldini, director of the office, filled his post so competently that he was viewed by the executive office and citizens as the "governor" of the upper peninsula.</p>
      <p>The Washington Office served as a clearinghouse for information on federal proposals, congressional legislation, and national policy developments. It also lobbied for the interests of the state. In pursuing these ambitious, if amorphous, interests, the Washington Office employed a staff of five to ten people over the years of Blanchard's tenure. The staff of the office worked with Blanchard, the executive office, and Michigan agency directors to develop responses to federal activity, to initiate timely communication between federal and state officials, and to arrange and conduct meetings and conferences when appropriate. Aside from the director of the Washington Office, E. Douglas Frost, who focused on budgets, taxes, and overall policy planning, each of the staff members in the office was responsible for broadly defined issues. Rosemary Freeman, who preceded Frost as office director, served as deputy director and handled issues related to training, labor, and education. James Callow was the legislative analyst charged with keeping abreast of economic and trade issues. Maura Cullen was responsible for social services, health and human services, and child welfare. Peter Kyriacopolous was the last of three analysts (Charlie Moses and Jo Ellen D'Arcy preceded him) who handled concerns related to the environment and transportation.</p>

          <p>The Chief of Staff/Executive Assistants, 1982-1991 series consists of 28 linear feet of materials arranged into seven subseries each focused on a staff member. These seven subseries fall into two distinct classes: Chief of Staff (F. Thomas Lewand, Phillip Jourdan, and Steve Weiss) and Executive Assistants (Nancy Austin-Schwartz, Bill Liebold, Carolyn Sparks, and Ron Thayer). The arrangement of the Chief of Staff materials follows the chronological terms of their tenure, so it roughly parallels Blanchard's first and second terms. The Lewand and Jourdan subseries cover Blanchard's first term; the Weiss subseries covers the second. As noted in the Scope and Content Note, there are no materials extant from Rick Cole's tenure as Chief of Staff. The materials of the Executive Assistants are arranged alphabetically according to staff member. This awkward melding of chronological and alphabetical arrangements was dictated by the original order of the records and by the desire to keep the materials of Chiefs of Staff and Executive Assistants in close proximity. The researcher is again cautioned that the upper echelons of the Blanchard staff did not hew to administrative taxonomies, thus there will be considerable interpenetration and overlap between subseries. The most extensive of these overlaps are noted in the folder and box listings.</p>

            <p>The F. Thomas Lewand subseries comprises one linear foot of materials and is arranged alphabetically by type of material or office of origin. Lewand's principal concern was overseeing Blanchard's transition from candidate to governor; similar materials can be found in the Government Relations series. This transition is best covered in the Lewand subseries by the memoranda, "key decisions," and budget materials of the transition office. The memoranda are a rich source on Blanchard's thinking as policies were implemented and assessed. Other materials of interest in this subseries can be found in the personnel folders, in which aspiring job-seekers attempt to trade personal and political capital for a position on the Blanchard team.</p>

            <p>The Phillip Jourdan subseries runs six linear feet and is arranged alphabetically according to type of material: assignment tracking, correspondence, departments, memoranda, and subject files. Jourdan's assignment tracking provides a good record of issues raised in memos and letters and tracks their handling by the various executive offices. The Blanchard correspondence in Jourdan's files are copies of outgoing letters Blanchard thought significant enough to policy that Jourdan should have a copy. These runs of assignment tracking and correspondence cover the years 1983-1986; the years 1986-1990 can be found in the files of Executive Assistant, Carolyn Sparks. Evidently these files fell out of the Chief of Staff's realm after Jourdan's tenure. Also of interest are the memoranda which detail Blanchard's involvement in the daily implementation and assessment of policy during his first term. The department and subject files are arranged alphabetically by department or issue and contain reports, memos, and correspondence.</p>

            <p>The Steve Weiss subseries consists of just over eight linear feet of records arranged alphabetically by type of material: budgets, departments, and topical. These document his activities both as Deputy Chief of Staff, 1986-1987, and as Chief of Staff, 1988-1990. The budget materials contain final drafts of executive budgets arranged chronologically by fiscal year. Other budget-related materials can be found in Carolyn Sparks' topical files and in the records of E. Douglas Frost in the Washington Office series. The bulk of the Weiss subseries consists of six linear feet of department files arranged alphabetically. These contain reports, briefing papers, and memoranda which the various departments wished to bring to the governor's attention during his second term. These are also a good source on Blanchard's efforts to control the various executive agencies. The last foot of material in this subseries consists of a topical file created for those issues which did not readily fit departmental categories.</p>

            <p>The Nancy Austin-Schwartz subseries consists of two categories: departments and issues. The subseries is five linear feet long. Austin-Schwartz' responsibilities as Deputy Chief of Staff entailed overseeing both the implementation of the State of the State agenda and the external relations of the Issues department. Thus the departmental materials in her files are a rich source on how well departments met Blanchard's expectations; whether the administration was meeting departmental needs; and how to respond to specific problems. The issues files consists of an alphabetical run of issues salient to Austin-Schwartz. The most significant of these are the State of the State folders which document her post hoc assessment of the year's programs. Other State of the State materials can be found in Carolyn Sparks' files and among the Issues and Press Office series. The State of the State was the principal public address of the governor, so it should come as no surprise that materials related to it appears in many files.</p>

            <p>The William Liebold subseries comprises over two linear feet of materials arranged alphabetically by type: cabinet, correspondence, and memoranda. The four folders of cabinet material are an extremely rich source on the meetings of Blanchard's executive committee and heads of departments. These were perhaps the most formal meetings between these high-ranking executives. The correspondence and memoranda provide a detailed record of Liebold's efforts to facilitate access to the governor.</p>

            <p>The Carolyn Sparks subseries consists of nearly five linear feet of records arranged alphabetically by type of material: assignment tracking, correspondence, departments, State of the State speeches, and topical. As Blanchard's Executive Assistant, Sparks performed many of the same tasks as Phillip Jourdan did as Chief of Staff. This is evident from the close linkages between the assignment tracking and correspondence files; Sparks' materials pick up where Jourdan's leave off. The department and topical files form the bulk of the Sparks' subseries and are arranged alphabetically by department and topic. These are a rich source on Blanchard's thinking and actions. All of these materials manifest Sparks' role as information broker for the Governor; clearly she was part a narrow loop of Blanchard confidantes. This closeness is further revealed by the State of the State speeches which have Blanchard's penned in notes and points of emphasis. These apparently were Blanchard's reading copies of the speeches.</p>

            <p>The Ron Thayer subseries forms the last three linear feet of the Chief of Staff/Executive Assistants series. It consists of records which document Thayer's fund-raising activities, the events/projects and political materials, and materials dealing with his service on the Lottery Task Force. The events/projects materials are arranged alphabetically by event, project, or name and consist of correspondence, memoranda, and budgets related to the particular event. Of special note here are the materials related to the 1987 National Governors' Association meeting in Traverse City. Michigan, as host state, relied heavily on Thayer to see to local arrangements, entertainment, planning, and program of this event; this was Thayer's one project for the early Summer 1987. The political fund-raising materials are arranged chronologically so that the researcher may conveniently examine each campaign. These materials are quite similar in nature and scope to the events/projects files. The Lottery Task Force materials are of a very different nature as they document Thayer's chairing of this group's investigation into allegations of impropriety in the Lottery Commission.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence Unit Annual Files, 1983-1990 series consists mainly of sixteen linear feet of materials created in the course of responding to constituent mail. The materials in this series are arranged in five subseries with the first term comprising the first of these subseries and four annual files making up the rest. Due to the quantity of constituent mail, issue and department oriented mail has been selectively thinned to provide a sense of its tenor in a reasonable bulk. The strengths of this series inhere not only in the range of issues raised and responses, but in what it reveals about a system which routinely handled thousands of pieces of mail in a week, usually responding within days of receipt.</p>
          <p>The 1983-1986 subseries, which runs nearly four linear feet, documents the work of the office for the first term. The bulk of the correspondence extant from the first term consists of mail identified as "Blanchard Personal." This is arranged alphabetically by correspondent, including materials from state departments, politicians, and the executive office. Prominent among these are Robert Bowman, John Engler, Ellen Globokar, Frank Kelly, Carl Levin, Robert Naftaly, Ron Thayer, and Coleman Young. This material neatly complements and nearly overlaps the personal correspondence of Blanchard in the files of Chief of Staff Phillip Jourdan and Executive Assistant Carolyn Sparks. The remaining correspondence in this subseries consists of standard responses arranged by type: information requests (ranging from anniversary and birthday greetings to various letters of congratulation) and issues-oriented or departmental responses. These standard responses were the Correspondence Office's means of answering the high volumes of mail; they provide researchers a quick view of Blanchard's positions on issues of the first term. A more detailed view on these positions can be gained by examining the staff files of the Issues series.</p>
          <p>Materials for the second term are arranged in four annual files, the 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990 subseries. The correspondence within these annual files is divided according to type of response: department, issue, or standard response. Within each of these sub-subseries the material is arranged alphabetically by responding department or by issue. The 1987 subseries' department files form the bulk of this five linear feet annual file. Within these departmental files, the letters are filed alphabetically by correspondent. The 1988 subseries consists of two linear feet of issues-oriented correspondence. The 1989 subseries has a similar run of issues mail and set of standard responses within its one and one-half linear feet of material. The last three and one-half linear feet of this series is the 1990 subseries. This annual file consists of department, issues, and standard response materials. Within the departmental alphabet, the more specific gradations are made according to unit within the department.</p>
          <p>The researcher should bear in mind some caveats when using the Correspondence series. The departmental and issue-related correspondence consists of a sampling of incoming letters, copies of the official response, and mailing lists of those receiving the response. Certain routine classes of correspondence have been removed from the collection: thank yous, general information requests, petitions, declarations, letters of congratulations, and tributes. These actions were taken to reduce the bulk of the series, and do not diminish its substantive content.</p>
          <p>The researcher should also note that the alphabets were created anew each year, so there are some inconsistencies in filing. One should be flexible in searching out related materials within and without the Correspondence series. For example, letters on environmental concerns can be found under the headings: landfill, solid waste, Great Lakes, and recycling (as well as the expected heading environment) within the issues files. Information on this topic will also be found in the Department of Natural Resources files and in the files of program specialists, David Dempsey (of the Issues Office) and Peter Kyriacopolous (of the Washington Office).</p>

          <p>The Government Relations, 1982-1990 series consists of fifty-five linear feet of transition files, correspondence, enrolled house and senate bills (and related materials), public acts, and topical files. These are arranged in three subseries: administration, legislation, and public acts.</p>

            <p>The administration subseries runs to nearly ten linear feet of material arranged alphabetically by type. The departmental transition files are one of the dispersed sources offering insight into the budgets, duties, and positions available to the new administration in 1983. The rest of the materials in this subseries provide unique perspectives into the interaction between the executive and legislative branches as they hammer out a legislative agenda. The directors' and legislative correspondence proffer complementary halves indicative of legislative intent.

            <p>The legislation subseries is the largest such unit in the Blanchard collection, totally just over forty-three linear feet of enrolled house and senate bills, bill analyses, roll calls, and related materials. These bills are arranged chronologically according to legislative session; within each legislature they are broken out by house of origin (house or senate); finally they are arranged by bill number, which is assigned sequentially within the session and house. This ultimately results in a specific chronological order for each enrolled bill. The bills are often accompanied by supporting documentation, but this varies is degree and type from bill to bill. Unfortunately for the researcher, there exists no readily available subject access to these enrolled bills; one must know the legislature, the house, and the bill number to use this subseries with dispatch.</p>

            <p>The public acts subseries provides some intellectual access to enrolled bills through its summaries and notes. This access is contingent on knowing the year of passage for the bill. The publication, Acts of the Legislation of the State of Michigan, provides similar access with the advantage of a subject index at the back of the book. The Bentley Library has this publication.</p>

          <p>The Issues Development, 1982-1990 series consists of a diverse body of materials generated by an office in constant flux caused by the many changing spheres and duties falling to the office. The series comprises thirty-two linear feet of materials, primarily correspondence and memoranda, which develop and define the administration's position on issues, arranged in three subseries: general staff, local government, and special projects. Researchers should note that each of these subseries reflects a distinct function of the office and that the office had varying degrees of control over the work. This is especially true of the local government and special projects subseries, which were included in the Issues series to facilitate access, but which in fact had considerable autonomy. The researcher is advised that the papers of Nancy Austin-Schwartz, head of the Issues Office, are with her other materials in the Chief of Staff/Executive Assistant series.</p>

            <p>The general staff subseries is arranged alphabetically by staff member, with parenthetical notes on which issues the staff member handled, and consists of nearly seven linear feet of correspondence and memos. The materials extant from each staff member range from a single folder to nearly two linear feet. This subseries is especially strong in evidencing administration positions on issues related to the arts, education, environment, civil rights, and health and human services. This strength is limited to the years 1983-1986, when responses to issue-oriented correspondence remained in this office; during the second term, responses to issue-oriented mail is retained by the Correspondence Office. These two runs of materials should be treated as complementary halves forming the whole picture of the administration's position on the issues. Researchers should also note that the Washington Office series contains materials related to issues. (See also Correspondence Unit, Boxes 34-46)</p>

            <p>The local government subseries consists of fifteen linear feet of correspondence from the varying levels (county, city, township, or village) of local government. These materials are arranged alphabetically by locale. This subseries consists of local officials' contact with the state executive and the executive branch response, usually from Connie Shorter or Leslie O'Reilly. Much of this is of a routine nature, but there are some substantive materials. The subseries as a whole provides insight into the process of intergovernmental relations</p>

            <p>The special projects subseries is an artificial grouping created during the course of processing and consists of nearly eleven linear feet of materials related to three projects: Cabinet Council on Human Investment, Citizens' Protection Advisor, and the Public Investment Task Force. These projects fell under the domain of Gary Bachula, Candace Avery, and Robert Mitchell respectively. The materials from the Cabinet Council on Human Investment document one of Blanchard's efforts to improve the human capital of Michigan. Avery's Citizens' Protection Advisor papers are arranged alphabetically by department or topic. They reveal an intriguing attempt to bring all manner of issues (ranging from crime and drugs to environmental protection) pertaining to individual citizens under the aegis of one state office. Of special note here is Avery's work on the state of the state speeches for Blanchard's second term. Mitchell's materials from the Public Investment Task Force are arranged by type and document one of the central efforts of Blanchard's first term, the attempt to rebuild Michigan's infrastructure. These materials offer an extremely rich source on this much-discussed phenomenon. The committees files provide a rough subject access to the areas of concern; the correspondence and meetings files reveal the process; and the public hearings reflect the "road-show" efforts to solicit public support for the task force.</p>

          <p>The Legal Division, 1983-1990 series consists of the papers of Mike Hodge, Blanchard's legal counsel. This series consists of ten linear feet of correspondence, briefs, memoranda, and reports related to a wide range of legal matters facing the governor. As Hodge became legal counsel during Blanchard's second term, the materials provide better coverage of the years 1987 to 1990. The researcher should note that the State Archives holds all materials related to pardons and extraditions. This series is broken down into three subseries: correspondence, departments, and topical.</p>
          <p>The departments and topical subseries should be viewed as complementary units as they were part of a single alphabet in Hodge's files. They were broken into two subseries in the course of processing in order to parallel other filing systems in the upper echelons of Blanchard's executive office. This should ease access, when this series is opened to research.</p>

            <p>The correspondence subseries is arranged alphabetically by correspondent, usually a member of the legal or executive office staff, and comprises six linear inches. While physically thin, these materials are quite rich in substance given the positions of the principals and the nature of their discourse.</p>

            <p>The department subseries consists of four linear feet of materials arranged alphabetically by department. As one might expect given the legal thrust of this office, the thickest and richest materials are found in the departmental files of the attorney general, corrections, and state police. Surprisingly, the files provide substantive documentation on the citizens' review committee on civil service and the departments of management and budget and public health.</p>

            <p>The topical subseries runs just over five linear feet and is arranged alphabetically. The strong areas of this topical file are those related to crime and corrections, ongoing legal cases, potential legal impact of legislation, and the state supreme court. Again, there are unexpected strengths within these topical files, materials on campaign financing and a complete list of Blanchard's executive orders being just two instances of this documentation</p>

          <p>The Operations, 1981-1990 series consists of twenty linear feet of materials arranged into two subseries according to office classification: blue folders and other scheduling files. The vast majority of material in this series consists of the blue folders created by the Operations Division staff to prepare Blanchard for public appearances. This subseries totals nearly eighteen linear feet of materials arranged chronologically and consists of reports, briefing papers, speeches, and schedules. These materials provide a unique insight into the labor-intensive process of bringing the governor and his message to the people. The other scheduling files subseries includes confidential schedules, events done, and gubernatorial campaign The confidential schedules and events done sub-subseries provide summary information on where, when, and before whom Blanchard appeared in public. These are of a limited use, made more valuable by the closure of the richer records contained in the blue folders. The gubernatorial campaign sub-subseries provides a wealth of detail on Blanchard's initial campaign for the governor's office. In some ways, these files can be viewed as the prototype for the blue folders, providing background and briefing materials, scheduling information, and speeches used by Blanchard as a candidate.</p>

          <p>The Personnel, 1983-1990 series, like the Legal series, provides only a portion of the expected documentation due to the fact that the collection contains only the papers of Greg Morris, and these papers contain only materials related to Blanchard's judicial appointments. Materials pertaining to appointments to boards, commissions, and administrative positions was not part of the Blanchard collection. The Personnel series consists of four linear feet of materials arranged in two subseries: one alphabetical by judicial appointee, the other chronological by date of appointment. Each of the subseries provides summary data on the candidates, a recap of the personal and professional recommendations, and information on the administration's decision. Given that these two subseries provided such neat and accessible summary data, the bulky files containing the candidates resumes and recommendations were removed from the collection.</p>

          <p>The Press Office, 1982-1991 series consists of fifty-four linear feet of diverse materials arranged into seven subseries based on type of materials. These subseries are grouped into two classes according to media, paper or non-paper. Within the paper medium, the subseries are arranged alphabetically by type of material: newspaper clippings, press releases, speeches, and topical files. The non-paper medium consists of photographs, audiotapes, and videotapes. Materials within the Press Office series comprise an admixture not only in terms of media, but also in terms of creation and collection of the materials. The office, in addition to creating records in the course of fulfilling its media relations and information dissemination missions, also gathered materials in meeting its informal mission to serve as archives for the Blanchard administration. The press releases, topical files, and audiotapes were created by the Press Office in the course of its daily operations. The newspaper clippings and speeches were pulled together by the office to judge the impact of its efforts. The photographs and videotapes were sometimes created by staff members, but were more often given to the office by people not on the staff. The myriad types and sources of documents cohere to make the Press Office series the thickest and richest source on the full scope of the Blanchard governorship.</p>

            <p>The newspaper clippings subseries consists of five linear feet of xerox copies of newspaper articles, features, and editorials related to Blanchard, his administration, and the state during his tenure. These clips, drawn primarily from the two Detroit and one Lansing paper, are arranged in a strict chronological order. This subseries is a fine source by which to gauge the efficacy of the Press Office and editorial opinion on Blanchard.</p>

            <p>The press releases sub-series consists of two chronological runs of press releases totaling just over four linear feet. The first of these is comprised of annual summaries (month-by-month) of the substantive press releases, those noting policy developments or significant appointments. The second, bulkier run of press releases consists of the daily production. These two runs of press releases superbly reflect one of the main functions of the office, the efforts to put the Blanchard program before the people of Michigan.</p>

            <p>The speeches subseries consists of four linear feet of Blanchard's public speeches arranged chronologically. Most often these speeches are the copies prepared by the Press Office for distribution to the assembled media, but occasionally (especially in the early years) the speech is Blanchard's reading copy. Not surprisingly, these public speeches are very well documented by the Blanchard collection; this is especially true of his State of the State addresses. Materials related to his State of the State speeches can be found in the files of Nancy Austin-Schwartz and Carolyn Sparks in the Chief of Staff/Executive Assistant series, in Candace Avery's files in the Issues series, and in the topical files, audiotapes, and videotapes of the Press Office series. (See also Chief of Staff/Executive Assistants Boxes 20, 26; Issues Boxes 128-129; Topical Box 187; Audio-and Videotapes Boxes 194-218)</p>

            <p>The topical subseries consists of nearly eight linear feet of disparate materials, ranging from correspondence, notes, and memoranda, to briefing and background papers, to published reports, used for reference by the Press Office. While these files cover a broad range of issues across the full temporal span of Blanchard's tenure, there are focal points which merit highlighting. The budgets publications reflect the administration's outreach efforts to inform the populace of the immediate impact of state government. The departmental publications from Commerce, Management and Budget, Natural Resources, and Public Health similarly tried to demonstrate this impact. The Dukakis talking points reveal Blanchard's close link with Dukakis' failed attempt for the presidency. Finally, the State of the State files contain printed and manuscript copies of this crucial policy statement, as well as background materials.</p>

            <p>The photographs subseries, the first of the non-paper media, consists of just over five linear feet of photographs in folders and albums. The bulk of the photographs are primarily arranged in a topical file, alphabetically according to topic, event, or individual. In addition to this file, there are several folders of Blanchard personal photographs and a box of oversized images. There are also two boxes of photographic albums arranged topically by the central theme of the album. Many of the photographs are not of professional quality as they were candid snapshots which were later donated to the Press Office.</p>

            <p>The audiotapes subseries consists of over 1800 tapes in twenty boxes. These tapes are first arranged according to format (reel-to-reel and cassette), then in a strict chronological order. These audiotapes primarily document Blanchard's public appearances, speeches, press conferences, and press interviews. There are some tapes of other members of the Blanchard team, describing their work or the administration's position on an issue. These audiotapes were viewed as the core collection fulfilling the archival mission of the office, so were preserved in excellent order. Given the high esteem accorded these audiotapes, all identifiable tapes were retained.</p>

            <p>The videotapes subseries, like the photographs subseries, came to the Press Office from disparate sources, and provides visual documentation (moving in this instance) of Governor Blanchard. These videotapes are first arranged according to format (U-Matic and VHS), then in a rough chronological order. The chronological order is bent to accommodate grouping of clear and distinct runs of tapes. These videotapes were created by agencies other than the Press Office, and the quality of the tapes ranges from poor to broadcast quality. Of special note are the "Governor's Reports with Howard Lancour," a nearly complete set of this series of interviews, and the "Ask the Governor" tapes of J.P. McCarthy interviews with Blanchard. Researchers will doubtless avail themselves to the various videotapes of State of the State addresses to see the Governor's delivery of these important policy statements.</p>

          <p>The Upper Peninsula Office, 1983-1990 series consists of four linear feet of correspondence, memoranda, trip itineraries, briefing and background materials, and topical files. This series documents the efforts of Thomas Baldini, the governor's liaison to the constituents and elected officials of the entire Upper Peninsula. The materials are arranged in five subseries: correspondence, county files, education, Governor's U.P. trips, and topical. The correspondence, county, and topical subseries provide various points of access to the local concerns of U.P. constituents. These materials are a rich, diverse source on such issues as education, the environment, employment, prison construction, poor utility service, and Native American concerns as they are manifested in the Upper Peninsula in the 1980s. The education subseries is somewhat anomalous in that its geographic coverage is state-wide. This is due to the fact that Baldini was Blanchard's education advisor during part of his tenure. The Governor's U.P. trips subseries is the richest body of materials in this series. These eight folders contain a wealth of information on U.P. concerns including: briefing and background materials, itineraries, and local issues affecting county or region residents. Researchers should consult these folders first for the most coherent picture of regional concerns.</p>

          <p>The Washington Office, 1983-1990 series consists of twenty-one linear feet of correspondence, memoranda, budget materials, reports, testimony before Congress, legislation, and topical files which document fairly the office's efforts to protect Michigan's interests in budgetary, economic, employment, environmental, and human services issues. The materials are arranged in five subseries according to the person who created or used the record: E. Douglas Frost (Director), Rosemary Freeman (Assistant Director), James Callow (Analyst), Maura Cullen (Analyst), and Peter Kyriacopolous (Analyst). Within these subseries, there are some materials generated by the legislative analysts who predated them: Jane Snowden who preceded Cullen, and Charlie Moses and Jo Ellen D'Arcy who worked before Kyriacopolous. In each of these subseries only those records generated, created, or acted upon by the staffer have been retained; for the most part reference and "for your information" files have been removed.</p>

            <p>The E. Douglas Frost (Director) subseries consists of nine linear feet of materials of four general types: budgets, correspondence, materials related to the National Governors' Association, and topical. The budgets are first arranged chronologically by fiscal year and then from most finished product (published Executive Budgets) to least finished product (background materials and analyses). Other budget materials can be found in the Chief of Staff/ Executive Assistant series in the files of Steve Weiss and Carolyn Sparks. The chronological record of correspondence and the incoming log are the day-to-day records of the office and provide cursory insight into its activities. The National Governors' Association (NGA) materials document the involvement of Blanchard and the Washington Office in attempting to hammer out a workable compromise between Reagan's new federalism, the needs of the constituents of various states, and constrained states' revenues. The issues discussed at the annual meetings of the NGA permeated the body politic during the 1980s and apparently will dominate the political agenda of the 1990s and shape federal and state relations into the twenty-first century. The topical files provide the researcher with a quick fix on the range of issues dealt with by the Washington Office; for more detailed coverage, the researcher should consult the relevant materials in the legislative analysts' files. The strengths of Frost's topical files inhere in their coverage of Congress and the superconducting super collider.</p>

            <p>Rosemary Freeman served as the office's first director and moved to the deputy director slot when Frost hired on. In addition to these responsibilities, she handled education and employment as a legislative analyst. Given these wide-ranging roles, the materials of the Rosemary Freeman (Deputy Director) subseries are diverse. They comprise nearly four linear feet and are roughly arranged in annual files (in keeping with Freeman's filing system). Recurring headings in these annual files include: education, Great Lakes Governors, Michigan Employment Security Commission, unemployment insurance, and workers re-education and training. Other materials on the Great Lakes Governors can be found in the files of Shelby Solomon in the Issues series. Researchers should note that Freeman's annual files were not rigorous in regard to date of creation; materials created in 1987 are just as likely to be filed in the 1989-1990 annual files as the 1987. The office budgets in the 1989-1990 files is a case in point as they contain budgets dating back to 1983.</p>

            <p>The James Callow (Analyst) subseries consists of just over two linear feet of materials related to his areas of expertise, economics and trade. The bulk of the materials in this subseries are arranged alphabetically by issue in a legislative action file; documentation is especially rich on banking, Great Lakes trade, and U.S.-Canada trade issues. A second topical file covers the miscellaneous economic issues handled by Callow.</p>

            <p>The Maura Cullen (Analyst) subseries is similar to the Callow subseries in terms of extent and arrangement. The materials in this subseries run just over two linear feet and are arranged alphabetically by issue in a legislative action file; areas of less import are covered by a second topical alphabet. Cullen was responsible for issues related to health and human services, mental health, social services, and child welfare, and the subseries reflects her lobbying activities in these areas. The Cullen subseries contains some materials on quality control of food stamps created by Jane Snowden, Cullen's predecessor as social services analyst. Researchers are advised that there is considerable overlap between the Cullen, Callow, and Frost subseries; consult them all.</p>

            <p>The Peter Kyriacopolous (Analyst) subseries consists of nearly three linear feet of materials related to environmental issues and transportation. These materials are arranged alphabetically according to issue in a legislative action file and are especially strong in documenting: clean air, the Great Lakes, low level radioactive wastes, super-conducting super collider (SSC), superfund cleanup sites, and transportation. As these environmental issues became more salient as the 1980s unfolded it is not surprising that they generated thick documentation, both here and in the files of David Dempsey in the Issues series. The researcher is advised that Kyriacopolous subsumed the files of his predecessors, Charlie Moses and Jo Ellen D'Arcy, into his filing system.</p>

        <p>The researcher is advised that the Bentley Historical Library has other holdings directly related to the James J. Blanchard collection. The most immediately connected is the Janet Fox Blanchard collection, which documents her status and efforts as James Blanchard's first lady from 1989 to 1990. Other natural research links exist between the Blanchard collection and the collections of his gubernatorial forebears (William Milliken, George Romney, John Swainson, G. Mennen Williams, et al.) and the Bentley's holdings on the Democratic Party of Michigan.</p>
