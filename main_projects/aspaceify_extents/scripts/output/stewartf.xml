      <p>Ralph Randles Stewart, his first wife, Isabelle Darrow Stewart, and his second wife, Hladia Porter Stewart, were teachers and missionaries to that portion of the Indian sub-continent which became Pakistan in 1947. Ralph and Isabelle Stewart were both botany teachers and both functioned as amateur botanists, identifying and collecting examples of the flora from various regions of northern India and Pakistan. Hladia Stewart was an English teacher/missionary who wrote numerous stories, plays, travel articles and poems reflecting the lifestyle of northern India.</p>
      <p>Ralph Stewart was born in upstate New York in 1890 and received his undergraduate degree in botany from Columbia University in 1911. Immediately after graduation, he accepted a teaching position in botany at Gordon College in Rawalpindi, northern India near the Afghanistan border.</p>
      <p>He returned to Columbia in 1914 and began work on his Ph.D. During this period he married his first wife, Isabelle Caroline Darrow. After receiving his Ph.D in botany from Columbia, he and Isabelle returned to Gordon College in 1917 as botany teachers.</p>
      <p>In 1933, Stewart became the principal of Gordon College and remained in that position until 1955 when church policy mandated he relinquish the post. He became vice-principal until his retirement in 1960 when he joined the staff at the University of Michigan as a research assistant helping to identify plant species from northern India and Pakistan.</p>
      <p>After the death of Isabelle in 1953, Stewart married Hladia Porter in 1954. They moved to Ann Arbor in 1960 and formally retired to The Westminster Gardens in Durant, California in 1981. Here he became politically active in environmental issues, delivered numerous talks about his teaching career and botanical interests, and wrote for the community newspaper. At this writing (1992), R.R. Stewart is alive and resides in a full care facility in California.</p>
      <p>Hladia Stewart was born in India of missionary parents in 1896. Her father ended his career as principal of Gordon College in 1932. Hladia received her BA at Woodstock School in Landown, India and a Master's Degree from The College Of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio in 1919. After graduation, she returned to India to teach English at Kinnaird College, a girls school in Lahore. Following her marriage to Ralph Stewart in 1954, she moved to Gordon College where she was appointed Director of Women in addition to her teaching duties. She died in 1984.</p>

          <p>The Ralph Stewart portion of the collection is separated into those materials relating to his personal life, his botanical interests and writings, and his teaching career in that area of India which became Pakistan in 1947.</p>
          <p>The personal portion of Ralph Stewart's collection consists primarily of writings and reflections created after his retirement. These writings reflect upon his early life and family in upstate New York and New York City. The period of his life spent while in India is not well documented in these papers. Most of Stewart's reflections were written late in his life and seem designed to be delivered as speeches or expanded upon as journal articles. The collection does include some contemporary material relating to travel in parts of northern India. There are also numerous letters relating to his travel experiences and to the people he met while returning to India late in 1944.</p>
          <p>Stewart was one of the earliest botanists to begin studying the flora of northern India. His writings document the findings of numerous trips away from Lahour. This portion of the collection consists of his published checklists and observations, some with annotations, and his notes. Most of the notes were written after retirement but a small amount of contemporary material is included.</p>
          <p>A short unpublished paper relating to a particular plant collecting trip and written by Isabelle Stewart (Ralph's first wife) is included in a folder at the end of his collection.</p>

          <p>The second portion of the collection is made up of the writings of Hladia Porter Stewart. Consisting of numerous unpublished and privately printed books of poetry, plays and stories, these writings all relate to India. During her years in India, she contributed articles to local English language newspapers and magazines. Hladia Stewart was also an artist and some of her written work is illustrated with black and white drawings and watercolors. One small folder contains contemporary information about her teaching experiences at a girls college in India during the 30's and 40's. Another small folder contains material about the violence she observed during the creation of the Pakistani nation in 1947.</p>
