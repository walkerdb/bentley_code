    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>James B. Edmonson was born in Parkersburg, Iowa, on December 28, 1882, the son of James Bartlett and Nancy Jane Edmonson. He was married to Bess Chase on August 26, 1914, and had two children, Jane and Donald.</p>
      <p>Edmonson received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1906 and his Master's degree in history in 1910. He received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Chicago in 1925 in education and history.</p>
      <p>He was a teacher in the high school at Ionia, Michigan, and moved from there to the principalship of the high school at Hillsdale. In successive assignments he was principal at Benton Harbor and at Jackson, Michigan. In 1914 he returned to the University of Michigan as Inspector of High Schools and professor of Secondary Education, and he subsequently became the director of the Division of University Inspection of High Schools. In 1929 he became dean of the School of Education and served in that role until his retirement in February 1952. At the conclusion of his retirement furlough in February 1953, he was given the title of Dean Emeritus.</p>
      <p>Edmonson wrote numerous articles about educational issues, and was author and co-author of several textbooks on educational administration and high school civics.</p>
      <p>He served as secretary (1921-31) and president (1931-32) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. After his retirement, he continued to serve as chairman of the Committee on Athletics of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, of the Committee on Fraudulent Schools and Colleges of the National Education Association, and as co-chairman of the Canada-United States Committee on Education.</p>
      <p>Edmonson had a great interest in railroads and railroading and enjoyed travel. Also, throughout his life he was interested in church affairs and church-related problems of education, building, and finance. He was considered a strong defender of the ethical and spiritual significance of the work done in schools.</p>
      <p>James B. Edmonson died in his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on June 4, 1954.</p>

          <p>The Biographical/Personal, contains biographical information, including lists of published works, committee appointments, biographical sketches, tributes, and correspondence. Also included in this section are materials relating to Edmonson's hobby, railroads. A photograph folder contains a small amount of pictures of Edmonson and his colleagues, mostly from the 1950s.</p>
          <p>Edmonson's work with the University of Michigan Presbyterian Corporation is also well documented in Series One. The Corporation succeeded the Tappan Hall Presbyterian Association and represents the first work among Presbyterian college students in a state university. It is affiliated with the Ann Arbor Presbyterian Church. These folders include minutes from the Committee on Student Work, bylaws, Presbyterian Corporation Board of Trustees meeting minutes, and budget information. Although listed with this series, the family scrapbook is shelved as an oversized volume, separate from the collection. It contains correspondence, newspaper clippings, images of Edmonson as a young man, and other items "to revive pleasant memories."</p>

          <p>The Topical files series consists mainly of the writings of Edmonson on various issues in education, both secondary and college, and also includes correspondence, papers and essays, reports, minutes, and some published material by Edmonson. Some especially significant files include "Intercollegiate Athletics," under which can be found information on the increasing role of sports in colleges and the subsequent educational debate. "Intercollegiate Athletics" also contains a file on the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools pertaining to sports in colleges during the 1950s. A significant amount of information can be found on the "Canada-United States Committee on Education" which was formed to study the quality and quantity of information taught by each country about their neighbor. The "Fraudulent Schools" files contain correspondence and articles on the "diploma mills" of the 1950s, and the efforts to expose them. There are also folders on various aspects of secondary and college teaching and issues relating to public schools.</p>

          <p>The University War Board of the University of Michigan files were designated a separate series because they contain not only Edmonson's writings, but also the administrative documents of the board itself. Included are files relating to the University's shift in educational goals during World War II. Found here are writings by Edmonson, minutes of the Board, correspondence, reports, and publications. The "University War Board--Administration" files have been re-foldered, but the original order, as kept in three binders dated January-February, March-September, and October-November, 1942, has been maintained.</p>
