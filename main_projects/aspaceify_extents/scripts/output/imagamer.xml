      <abstract>Imagining America is a national consortium of colleges and universities that encourage sustainable campus-community partnerships in the arts, humanities, and design. From 2000 to 2007 Imagining America was hosted by the University of Michigan and directed by professor Julie Ellison. Imagining America fostered programs designed to enrich the public life of communities. The program sponsored a website, newsletter and annual national and state conferences and various scholarly and creative works.</abstract>

      <p>Imagining America (IA) began in March 1999, as a partner of the White House Millennium Council. IA's inaugural White House conference produced collective support for a community of action made up of university presidents, faculty artists, scholars, and community cultural leaders. In 2001, IA became a consortium of colleges and universities that grew to 70 consortium members by 2007. IA was based at the University of Michigan from 2000 to 2007, where it reported to the Office of the Vice President of Research. The program was funded from three sources: fees paid by member colleges and universities; support from several offices at the University of Michigan, in the form of both recurring and one-time-only allotments; and external grants. During this time Julie Ellison, a faculty member of the University of Michigan, was the IA director. "The End of the Beginning" report outlines the first two years of IA's founding and growth. Since then the program has developed multiple projects and initiatives such as the "Tenure Team Initiative" the "Publicly Active Graduate Education" (PAGE) program and many others. As of July 1st 2007, IA moved to Syracuse University, its new host university.</p>
      <p>Though the University of Michigan no longer supports the IA website, researchers can access many version of the site at the Internet Archive using the following URL: http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.ia.umich.edu. The following link is the organization's current website: http://www.imaginingamerica.org/</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The records of Imagining America (IA) were received in two accessions, in 2004 and 2007. In 2004, IA donated the "2004 Review" binders, which reviews the IA's history and accomplishments up to that point. In 2007, just before IA moved to its new host university of Syracuse, the IA donated a number of records that were organized into the following eight series: Mission, Overview and Website; Governance; History; Grants; Projects; Membership and Recruitment; Publications; and National Conferences.</p>

        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>The 2004 Review is a comprehensive two-volume overview of the IA program. These binders compile documents from IA's conferences, projects, correspondence, participation lists and records, staff and faculty accomplishments, awards, publications, websites, and press material. As a primarily grant funded initiative, IA measured its accomplishments by the success of its projects. This Review was likely used as a reference source for the IA staff, as documentation of partnerships, and as evidence of accomplishments to show potential participants and funders. The contents of the review are as follows. Volume 1: Self Study, History, Consortium, Responses to the Work of IA, Governance, Work of Faculty, Work of Colleges and Universities; Volume 2: Work of Language, IA at the University of Michigan, Funding, Staff, and Public Scholarship</p>
          <p>Though some of the binders' contents is duplicated in the two auxiliary boxes (some of the early newsletters for example), the binder's order and integrity have been maintained to provide a snapshot of how the project functioned and how it viewed itself in 2004. Of particular interest is the "Imagining Michigan Conferences" section. It was an annual series of conferences between 2000 and 2004 that used the "Imagining Your State Tool Kit" to identify ways to bring universities and community institutions within Michigan together. Book 1 has a CD-ROM "Highlights from November 2002 Conference."</p>

          <p>The History Series contains an early mission statement (1999) and records from the University of Michigan Faculty Advisory Committee including a list of deans and sample letters requesting recommendations for faculty committee members, correspondence with the deans, the advisory committee contact list, advisory meeting agendas, and minutes and a strategic planning survey given to all possible consortium members.</p>
          <p>The file Imagining America History, contains a folder of recruitment material for the IA President's council. This includes the official president's statement on the creation of IA, a sample letter from University of Michigan President Lee Bollinger to other university presidents, and a "Presidents' Checklist: 15 Steps to a Public Mission in the Arts, Humanities and Design." The UM Proposal is a program description and press release from the Woodrow Wilson Newsroom describing the initiative. The IA Consortium folder is a program description with a focus on how IA will help the University of Michigan.</p>
          <p>The Imagining America Transition file documents the IA transition from the University of Michigan to its new hosting site Syracuse University and the search for a new program director. Included are guidelines, mailings and applications to become the next host site, a new director job description, and PR outreach to Syracuse University.</p>
          <p>The Imagining America Correspondence folder contains letters to, from, and copied to IA director Julie Ellison between 1999 and 2003. Most correspondences are with other higher education professionals. The Association of Performing artist Presenters folder contains material used for the Arts Presenter's 2004 Annual Members Conference including drafts of Julie Ellison's keynote address, handouts, agendas and "No Subject Left Behind" a guide to arts education opportunities. Of special interest are two poems by Julie Ellison: "Looking Backward" and "The Detroit Observatory 1999." Imagining Michigan Awards contain award publicity, descriptions, information on the nominating committee, submissions, winner's announcement (Homeland Project in 2004 and Michigan Story Festival in 2005) and thank you letters. Also of special interest is a binder labeled Statewide Initiatives, which consist of a bio and newspaper clippings of Michigan community artist Mary Wright of Marquette Michigan, who was active in engaging IA with Upper Peninsula universities.</p>

          <p>The Projects Series consists of five files: the Tenure Team Initiative (TTI), Sekou Sundiata Residency, the Katrina Project and Best Practices website. According to the AI website, the TTI seeks to articulate and support the adventurous work of publicly engaged scholars and artists. The TTI material includes a white paper, a 2006 initiative background study written by Julie Ellison, and other background and reports. The Sekou Sundiata file documents Sundiata's University of Michigan residency and involvement in the 2006 national conference. The Katrina Project Web Resource is a print-out of IA's web content surrounding its Hurricane Katrina project. Included are compiled responses from higher education institutions, primary/secondary level educators, faith-based groups, National Organizations and Associations, State and Regional organizations and associations, community groups, and analysis, effects and rebuilding efforts.</p>
