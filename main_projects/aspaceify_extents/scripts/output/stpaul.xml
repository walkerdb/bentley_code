      <p>The German Evangelical St. Paul Church was founded in 1886 by Reverend C.C. Haag and sixteen founding families, led by G. Almendinger, Martin Gassenmeier, Christ Guenther, Joseph Hoffman, Ludwig Jungkind, Philip Kainoth, Charles Piella, Ulrich Rosli, Fred Schubel, Johann Schwarz, Philipp Seyfried, Felix Siegrist, Henry Siegrist, Dr. Charles Ultes, Julius Karl Wolf, and Gottlieb Ziegler. (The spelling of names changed over the years; these spellings were taken from the first bound volume of the church's constitution and records.) The young Reverend Haag and his wife had been called from Germany to America by the Michigan District of the Evangelical Synod of North America as a response to the interest shown by these families to begin another German church in the Lansing area.</p>
      <p>The first services were held on September 12, 1886, in a church rented from the English Church Society. St. Paul's was officially founded on October 17, 1886. With Rev. Haag also conducting services in Charlotte and Grand Ledge, his wife assumed leadership of the Sunday School class of fifteen children and also started the Ladies Aid Society for the women of the church.</p>
      <p>In 1888, under the leadership of Reverend F. Macer, St. Paul Church purchased land at the corner of Genesee and Walnut Streets, on which they built a frame church and parsonage. Nineteen years later, with the congregation led by Reverend E.H. Spathelf, these buildings were sold and moved, and St. Paul Church built the current brick building, completed in 1908. By 1909 contributing membership had increased to 55 people, and a 17-member choir was formed. By 1936, contributing membership had increased even further to 250 people. Church records were kept in German until circa 1920, and services were still conducted in German until around 1930.</p>
      <p>The St. Paul's Missionary Society was started by women of the church in 1926 to conduct mission work "in Christian service to the local church community, Evangelical Synod, and the Kingdom at large." In 1930 the Tabitha Society was formed as a community service and fund-raising group for the church. (This group later became the Women's Fellowship in the 1940s.)</p>
      <p>1934 saw the merger of the Evangelical Synod and the Reformed Church in the United States, and the church's name was subsequently changed to St. Paul Evangelical and Reformed Church.</p>
      <p>In 1954, the church purchased the lot adjacent to the church and razed the apartment house on it, which had been previously gutted by fire. The following year the empty lot was used to build a "New Wing" on the church for a choir rehearsal room, robe storage, meeting space, kitchenette, furnace room and Sunday School rooms. The addition was dedicated on October 30, 1955.</p>
      <p>In 1961 another merger took place. The church was renamed St. Paul United Church of Christ after the joining of the Evangelical and Reformed Church with the Congregational Christian Church.</p>
      <p>A fire in the spring of 1978 caused heavy smoke damage to the building and destroyed many of the church's historical records. Throughout the years the church celebrated its major anniversaries with celebrations, and for its centennial celebration, the mayor of Lansing declared October 19, 1986, "St. Paul United Church of Christ Day."</p>
      <p>St. Paul Church shared its building and facilities with a number of various new churches and organizations in the 1990s, including St. Stephen's Community Church (1992-1993), Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (1996); and the Church in the City, hosted by The Mount Hope Church (1997-1998). They also shared their facilities with the Michigan Dyslexia Institute, Horizons (divorce counseling) and Harvest House Children at Risk.</p>
      <p>The church struggled to continue in the 1980s and 1990s for a variety of reasons. The congregation fought continually through planning, fund-raising, efforts to increase membership and votes to remain in operation as an individual church. On January 11, 1998, however, the congregation voted to dissolve, and the last service was held by Reverend Douglas Asamoa on April 19, 1998.</p>

      <p>The records of St. Paul United Church of Christ in Lansing, MI, consist of 6.2 linear feet and 1 oversize folder. The materials consist of administrative materials, publications, records of historic events, and several bound volumes of historic materials, including the church's constitution, council meeting minutes, meeting minutes and activities of various women's organizations, and photographs. Bound volumes through c.1920 are in German, reflecting the ethnic origins of the church. The records are arranged into eight series: History, Membership, Property, Administration, Bulletins and Newsletters, Women's Organizations, Sunday School, and Photographs. These materials reflect the evolution of the St. Paul's from a small, German church at the end of the 19th century into an urban church at the end of the 20th century. We know from historic accounts by members and from newsletters that a fire in 1978 destroyed some of the church's records, but there does not appear to be any documentation in the collection that details which records were destroyed.</p>

          <p>The Administration series is one of the most extensive series in the collection. It comprises 1.1 linear feet. The first subseries are two bound volumes which include the Constitution and Council minutes from 1909-1936. The third volume in the series is a bound ledger of financial transactions from 1907-1913. The foldered 1946-1998 Yearly Files that follow include Council meeting minutes, Annual Reports, Treasurer's Reports, Pastor's Reports, administrative correspondence between the Council and other organizations within the church, and correspondence with organizations outside the church. As a whole this series recounts the monthly and annual goings-on of the church, its evolution over ninety years, the organized effort to run the church smoothly, and the ties among Council members and between the Council and other organizations.</p>

            <p>The Bulletins and Newsletters series comprises 2.3 linear feet and includes almost all regular publications produced by St. Paul's from 1946 until its close in 1998. In their original order, bulletins and newsletters were sometimes kept together and sometimes separated; this order is reflected in the current organization. The bulletins detail the hymns, readings, sermon topics and responses for each weekly worship service, as well as meeting notices and upcoming events. The newsletters, published monthly, include messages from the pastor, notices or schedules of upcoming events, announcements of births, birthdays, weddings, anniversaries and deaths, general church-related news items, timely items of interest, and humorous cartoons.</p>

          <p>The series of Women's Organizations includes the histories and administration of the Ladies Aid, Tabitha, Missionary Society, Women's Guild, and Koinonia groups of the church. It comprises 1.7 linear feet. The majority of these documents are in bound journals, including the Ladies Aid constitution and early meeting minutes in German. The remaining foldered materials were removed from the bound journals and collected from files. These records recount the generous nature of the women of the church and their numerous contributions to local and international causes, fund-raising efforts for St. Paul's, and caregiving to church members in need.</p>
