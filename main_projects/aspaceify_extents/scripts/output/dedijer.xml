    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Vladimir Dedijer, a Yugoslav author and scholar, was a Visiting Professor of History at the University of Michigan three times during the 1970s. He is known best for his writings on Yugoslav history, most notably his biography of Marshall Josip Broz (Tito) and his war diaries of his experiences as a member of the partisan army during the Yugoslav Revolution.</p>
      <p>Dedijer was born in Belgrade in 1914 to Jevto and Milica Dedijer. His father was a professor of geography at Belgrade University. His mother, a social worker, was actively involved in the women's liberation movement in Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p>Dedijer became active in international affairs at an early age, attending the Conference for Reconciliation in Poland in 1929 as a delegate of Yugoslav high school youth. In 1931, he attended the XX World Congress of the Young Men's Christian Association in Cleveland, Ohio. Following high school, Dedijer worked for the daily newspaper <title render="italic">Politika</title> while studying law. He received his Doctorate of Philosophy in Law from Belgrade University in 1956. As a journalist he served as a foreign correspondent in Poland, Denmark, Norway (1935), England (1935-1936), and Spain (1936). He was fired from <title render="italic">Politika</title> in 1937 by order of the Yugoslav government for supporting the Republican government in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. From 1937 to 1941 Dedijer worked in various positions at a number of underground publications.</p>
      <p>During the early 1930s Dedijer had begun forming ties with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY). In 1937 he made the acquaintance of such influential Yugoslav Communist leaders as Tito, Edvard Kardelj, Milovan Djilas, and Aleksandar Rankovic. The CPY had existed in Yugoslavia for many years despite being outlawed in 1920 and was under the control of the Soviet Union. Tito had been a member of the CPY since 1920 and was imprisoned as a result of his communist activity from 1928 to 1934. Following his release from prison, Tito became a member of the Central Committee of the CPY, then of the Politburo, and finally, in 1937, assumed leadership of the party.</p>
      <p>In April 1941 Germany invaded Yugoslavia. The country of Yugoslavia was created at the end of World War I, but tensions among its diverse ethnic population remained strong; therefore, the reaction of Yugoslavia and its people to the Axis invasion varied greatly. Tito and his partisan forces determined to fight the Germans and those Yugoslav units that supported Hitler. The division in the country was in fact a civil war -- the Yugoslav Revolution -- that was not resolved until the victory of Tito and his forces in 1945.</p>
      <p>Dedijer joined Tito and the partisans in 1941 in their struggle against the Axis forces and served as Lieutenant Colonel in Tito's headquarters. It was during this period that Dedijer began keeping his diaries of the war, published by the University of Michigan Press in 1990 and described as "the most detailed and important source about Yugoslavia and the partisans in World War II" (John Fine, Introduction to <title render="italic">War Diaries</title>, p. xv).</p>
      <p>During the next ten years Dedijer rose among the political ranks of the CPY, holding a variety of appointments and positions. In April 1945 he was a member of the Yugoslav delegation to the United Nations and also attended the General Assemblies of the United Nations in 1946, 1948, 1951, and 1952. He attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1946 as a member of the Yugoslav delegation. Dedijer was appointed to the Yugoslav Parliament in 1953 and served as chairman of the foreign relations committee.</p>
      <p>In early 1954, Dedijer's friend and comrade Milovan Djilas was dismissed from his positions as Vice President of Yugoslavia and president of the Parliament for making statements in the press critical of the communist government. Dedijer defended Djilas' freedom of expression before the Central Committee of the CPY in January 1954, and thus was expelled from the CPY, removed from his political offices, and dismissed from his teaching position in the History Department at the University of Belgrade. Both men were found guilty of criminal charges at a secret trial in January 1955. Djilas received a three year jail sentence. Dedijer received a six-month suspended sentence, however the verdict continued to have severe consequences on both his personal and professional life for the next five years.</p>
      <p>By 1960 Dedijer was permitted to commence lecturing abroad and in the following years held various academic posts in Sweden, England, and the United States. He also became acquainted with and corresponded with such intellectuals and activists as Bertrand Russell, Jean Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, G.D.H. Cole, Noam Chomsky, Eleanor Roosevelt, and many others. As a result of these contacts Dedijer became actively involved with the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation and its War Crimes Tribunals.</p>
      <p>The Bertrand Russell War Crimes Tribunal was co-founded by Bertrand Russell and Jean Paul Sartre in 1966. Its original purpose was to examine the activities of the United States in Vietnam. The members of the Tribunal included Jean Paul Sartre as Executive President, Dedijer as Chairman and President of Tribunal sessions, and other notable figures as Simone de Beauvoir, Lazaro Cardenas, Stokely Carmichael, and Dave Dellinger. The purpose of the Tribunal was later expanded to investigate acts of aggression and human rights violations committed by any country.</p>
      <p>Dedijer's writings are numerous; his articles and reviews have been published in many scholarly publications, and he has written a number of books on the history of Yugoslavia and its people. <title render="italic">Tito Speaks</title>, the authorized biography of Marshall Josip Broz, was published in 1952, significant for Tito's narrative recollections of the break with Stalin in 1948. <title render="italic">The Beloved Land</title> (1961) is an autobiographical account of Yugoslav history beginning with Dedijer's ancestors. <title render="italic">The Road to Sarajevo</title> (1966) reexamines the origins of World War I, throwing new light on the people and events surrounding the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Published in 1971, <title render="italic">The Battle Stalin Lost</title> describes Stalin's unsuccessful attempts to depose Tito after the CPY was kicked out of the Comintern and the reactions of Yugoslav communists to Stalinist policies.</p>
      <p>With respect to his family, Dedijer was married twice and had five children. His first wife, Olga Popovic, was a field surgeon for the partisans and was killed in 1943 during the Yugoslav Revolution at the battle of Sutjeska Canyon. Dedijer was remarried in 1944 to Vera Krizman, an actress who had been imprisoned for writing anti-fascist graffiti on houses. He and Vera had five children: two daughters, Bojana and Milica, and three sons, Borivoje ("Boro"), Branimir ("Branko"), and Marko. Vladimir Dedijer died on November 30, 1990, in New York.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series (0.4 linear feet) is divided into two subseries, "In English" and "In Other Languages", the latter composed mostly of letters in Serbian and Croatian. Correspondence is arranged chronologically within each subseries and includes both chatty, personal letters as well as intellectual discussions of contemporary political issues. Located in this series are Dedijer's letters to and from such notables as Eleanor Roosevelt, Orson Welles, Lillian Hellman, and Simone de Beauvoir. Other noteworthy correspondents include Noam Chomsky, Hamilton Fish Armstrong, C.L. Sulzberger, G.D.H. Cole, and George Seldes.</p>
          <p>Regarding additional correspondence in other series, the Topical Files series includes correspondence with Milovan Djilas, G.D.H. Cole, and Arlette and Jean-Paul Sartre; the Bertrand Russell War Crimes Tribunals series includes correspondence with Bertrand Russell, Arlette and Jean Paul Sartre, and other Tribunal members; the Project Files series includes correspondence with Orson Welles and Jean Paul Sartre; and the Scrapbook within the Printed Materials series contains letters from Louis Adamic, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Tito. While many letters are of substantial length, much of the correspondence with famous figures is of autograph value only.</p>

          <p>Most notable within the Topical Files series (1.0 linear feet) are the materials relating to Milovan Djilas and to Jean Paul Sartre. The Djilas materials are divided into two groups, the first being materials relating to the trial. Here are Djilas' correspondence with Dedijer, detailed materials regarding Djilas' criticism of the government, Dedijer's support of Djilas, the trial of Djilas, and the resulting effects on the lives of Dedijer and Djilas and their families. Also of interest in this series are the materials regarding Jean Paul Sartre which include correspondence, newsclippings, and notes relating to various projects he and Dedijer developed and worked on together.</p>

          <p>The majority of the materials in the Bertrand Russell War Crimes Tribunals series (1.3 linear feet) are from the 1967 investigative hearings of the Tribunal regarding the crimes allegedly committed by the United States against Vietnam. The supporting Documents and Reports reviewed by the Tribunal members during the hearings comprise the bulk of the materials. The Documents and Reports also include transcripts of testimony heard by the Tribunal members during the hearings. The remainder of the materials focus on subsequent investigations by the Tribunal, such as the investigation in 1986-1987 regarding the World War II activities of Kurt Waldheim, former president of Austria. This series also contains materials relating to organizations similar to the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation.</p>

          <p>The Project Files series (1.5 linear feet) contains research and other materials relating to Dedijer's major projects and is divided into two subseries: Film and Television Projects, and Books. Within each subseries, projects are generally arranged alphabetically by the name of the film or publication. Types of materials found here for films include newsclippings, correspondence, and drafts of scripts; and, for books, outlines, drafts, research materials, book reviews, and correspondence. Within the research materials for <title render="italic">Sarajevo 1914</title> are the unpublished book manuscripts of Dragisa Stojadinovic.</p>

          <p>The series Audio and Visual Materials (.8 linear feet) is divided into three subseries: Cartoons, Sketches, and Caricatures; Photographs; and Audiocassette Tapes. The Cartoons, Sketches, and Caricatures are few in number and generally date from the 1950s. The Photographs make up the bulk of this series and are separated into two groups, one group comprised of photographs taken by John Phillips, a photographer for <title render="italic">Life</title> magazine, and the other group containing all other photographs. The number assigned to each of the John Phillips photographs corresponds with the descriptions of the photographs located at the beginning of this group. The researcher should also be aware that the photographs taken by John Phillips are copyrighted by John Phillips. The three Audiocassette Tapes of an interview with Dedijer on his life experiences are closed.</p>
