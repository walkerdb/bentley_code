      <p>The University of Michigan Medical School's Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is a highly competitive dual degree program resulting in a MD from the Medical School and a Ph.D. from the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. The purpose of the program is to prepare graduates for biomedical research careers. The program was established in December 1979, and began operations on July 1, 1980. The program coordinates recruiting, financing, curriculum and monitoring for the fellows. The program is not degree granting, and does not offer any courses. The program takes approximately seven years to complete. There were four students in the first group of fellows in 1980. Since that year, the number of incoming fellows averages between six and nine fellows per year. As of 1998, there were 68 graduates of the program.</p>
      <p>Most of the funding for the program is provided by a grant from the National Institute of Health, through the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. The first grant was approved in 1980, with subsequent renewals in 1985, 1990, and 1995. The bulk of the grant provides for fellowships for each student, including full tuition and stipend.</p>
      <p>The Operating Committee is the chief advisory committee of the MSTP. The committee also functions as the advisory admissions committee. The committee advises the Program Director and Associate Directors of the program.</p>
      <p>General oversight of the program is performed by the Policy Committee. The purpose of the committee is to review the annual activities of MSTP, and to recommend policies for those matters that may cross departmental, and/or medical school - graduate school jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>For further current information consult the MSTP web page at the following URL: http://www.med.umich.edu/medschool/mstp/</p>

          <p>The Administrative series is comprised of two major areas: funding and management matters. An NIH grant application for 1990-1995 comprises the major part of the Funding subseries. Included in the General folders is the report produced for the NIH site visit in 1994, for the renewal of the grant. A small amount of correspondence regarding program expenditures and stipends during the period from 1986 to 1993 is included. A Program Management folder contains job descriptions, a management schedule, and recommendations resulting from an administrative review. These papers provide background for the policy procedures and decisions of the program.</p>

          <p>Committee Agendas and Minutes is organized according to Committee names and by their activities such as reporting and retreats. The Committees are Policy Committee, Program Committee, Review Committee, and Social Sciences Committee.</p>
          <p>The Planning Committee met during 1979 to discuss the implementation of the program. The Operating Committee is the chief advisory committee of the program, and also serves as the advisory admissions committee. The subseries contains agendas and minutes from meetings, 1979 through 1989. The committee is composed of one representative from each degree granting graduate program participating in MSTP, two MSTP fellows, a clinical faculty member, and the Program and Associate Directors. The committee meets generally six to seven times per year.</p>
          <p>The purpose of the Review Committee was to review the progress of the program and to plan for its future. The committee met between late 1983 through May 1984, releasing its report on June 1, 1984. The Policy Committee performs the general oversight of the program. The committee also addresses issues that cross departmental boundaries and/or medical school - graduate school jurisdiction. The subseries includes the minutes for meetings from 1980 to 1985, with the exception of 1982. The committee is composed of the department chairmen, two inter-collegiate doctoral program directors, and the deans of the graduate and medical schools. The committee meets on an as-needed basis. The Program Committee contains no minutes or agendas, but includes correspondence relating to preparations for the annual scientific retreats and social events.</p>
          <p>Some of the records in the record group are restricted in order to protect individual privacy. The unrestricted committee materials are useful for observing the growth of the program from its inception, as well as the analysis and future planning from reviews.</p>

          <p>Correspondence is primarily a record of founder George DeMuth's communication regarding the support of MSTP candidates and students. This includes assistance in locating aid, providing recommendations, and mediation of various faculty/student communication issues. Another well represented activity is DeMuth's promotion of the newly developed program to other members of U-M's Medical School faculty and members of the medical field at large.</p>
