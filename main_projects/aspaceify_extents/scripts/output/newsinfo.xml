      <p>News and Information Services (NIS) is the media relations office of the University of Michigan. NIS disseminates (to internal and external audiences) information about university programs, research, and activities of faculty and staff, primarily through the news media. NIS also responds to media requests for information about the university. Staff is comprised of information officers and editors covering specific university units, a photography unit, and a radio and television unit. This office also publishes <title render="italic">The University Record</title>, a weekly newspaper for faculty and staff, and <title render="italic">Michigan Today</title>, a quarterly tabloid newspaper sent to U-M alumni (complete sets of these publications are held by the Bentley Library). Some units on campus handle media relations through offices largely independent of NIS. These units include sports information, the Medical Center, the College of Engineering, Law School, and Business School.</p>
      <p>News and Information Services has undergone several name and organizational changes, but can trace its roots to 1897, when the Regents requested a plan for to disseminate University news to the State. This original department of information services was primarily responsible for publishing newsletters and frequently struggled to finance its operations. By 1930, the need for a news agency had grown, and following the installation of President Alexander G. Ruthven, the university created a News Dissemination Service (often called the University of Michigan News Service). Led by Wilfred B. Shaw, the Service had two primary functions. First, it was responsible for preparing weekly releases for nearly 800 newspapers throughout the state and beyond. This reporting included news about the Regents, research conducted by professors, affairs of the student body, and all other campus news with the exclusion of athletics. The second function was to send news about individual students to their home town papers. (<title render="italic">Michigan Alumnus</title> May 27, 1959).</p>
      <p>Originally part of the Bureau of Alumni Relations, in 1942 the University News Service, now led by Donald K. Anderson, became an independent department. In 1946, Arthur L. Brandon was appointed as the Director of Information Services and took over responsibility for the public information services on behalf of the University, services which included the University News Service, news photography, and promotional publications. In 1948, services expanded with the acquisition of the WUOM radio station and continued to adapt to new media with the addition of television.</p>
      <p>With the administrative changes resulting from the installment of President Harlan H. Hatcher, Brandon's title was changed to Director of University Relations and the University News Service became part of the Office of University Relations. Other changes followed, with Regents meetings being opened to the press in 1954 and University News Service taking on photographic coverage at athletic events in 1956. In 1957, Brandon resigned from his position and was replaced by Lyle M. Nelson. As Director of University Relations, Nelson combined radio and television under the director of broadcasting. Nelson retired in 1961 and was replaced by Michael Radock. One year later, administrative reorganization created an Information Service.</p>
      <p>The Information Service consisted of three divisions, including News Service, News Photography, and Community Relations. Further reorganization in 1963 and 1964 moved the publications and editorial services under the umbrella of Information Services and saw the promotion of Cleland B. Wyllie, who had been with the News Service since the 1940s, to Director of Media Relations.</p>
      <p>While the Office of University Relations underwent several changes and reorganizations in the following years, Information Services remained under its jurisdiction until 1998, when the office was divided into three vice presidential posts. One of these new posts was the Vice President for Media Relations, which was responsible for the University's News Service. In 2000, the Media Relations became the Office of the Vice President for Communications, which is where the current News Service resides in the University organization. News Service has continued to expand its media types and now includes podcasts, social media, and other online resources in addition to its print, radio, and television services.</p>

      <p>The News and Information holdings document how the university is portrayed in the media and the efforts of the university to promote itself. Although there is some correspondence from 1900-1903 and the 1930s, the bulk of the records date from 1946 to the present. The value of the files is as a source of ready information (on a yearly basis) about the activities and research accomplishments of university faculty and staff, departments, colleges and schools, libraries, centers, and other units. The records also chronicle notable events and visits by famous scholars and celebrities through yearly topical files, press releases, and correspondence. News and Information Service holdings also contain extensive photographic material (prints, negatives, slides, and transparencies) generated by the photography unit in addition to non-photographic records. The substantial photographic holdings are described in a separate finding aid.</p>
      <p>The non-photographic News and Information Services records include some correspondence of the unit's administrators, although the bulk consists of news clippings, published materials, press releases, and other background information collected by NIS and arranged topically by year. The records are organized into eight series: CORRESPONDENCE, PRESS RELEASES, MISCELLANEOUS, TOPICAL FILES, GERALD R. FORD, UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS, and ARCHIVED WEBSITES.</p>

          <p>The CORRESPONDENCE series (11 linear feet, 1900-1903, 1929-1959) is arranged in four subseries: Correspondence, 1900-1903, 1929-1943; Director's Correspondence, 1946-1951; Editor's Correspondence, 1946-1951; and Director of University Relations Correspondence, 1950-1959. Most correspondence is with newspapers, magazine publishers, other universities, and radio and television broadcasting firms and associations.</p>
          <p>The earliest correspondence, 1900-1903, includes letters written to Ralph Ellsworth relating to inquiries asking other universities about their information dissemination activities. Correspondence from 1929 to 1943 is chronologically arranged material sent and received by Roger Morrisey and Wilfred B. Shaw and reflects some of the alumni information activities once handled by the office as well as contact with press agencies and newspapers throughout Michigan and the nation</p>
          <p>Director's Correspondence, 1946-1951, and Editor's Correspondence, 1946-1951, are similar in content. These two alphabetically arranged subseries comprise the correspondence of Arthur L. Brandon and Cleland B. Wyllie along with some other staff members. Wyllie served as editor but also handled other responsibilities within the office.</p>
          <p>The most substantial subseries is the Director of University Relations Correspondence, 1950-1959, arranged alphabetically by topic. It is primarily the correspondence of Arthur L. Brandon. Topics include academic freedom and anti-communism activities (filed under "subversive activities"), the 250th anniversary of Detroit's founding, Harlan Hatcher's inauguration as president, controversy surrounding the renaming of Michigan State University, atomic research sponsored by the Phoenix Project, the 1955 Salk Polio vaccine testing and announcement, and radio and television broadcasting. General information on university activities and programs appears throughout the files, which also include scattered press releases, articles, and clippings in addition to the correspondence. Newspapers and magazines doing stories on the university, such as <title render="italic">Life</title>, are well represented within this subseries.</p>

          <p>The largest series, TOPICAL FILES (106 linear feet, 1971-2003), consists of yearly alphabetically arranged topical files ("Academic Affairs" to "WUOM"). Folders typically contain a mixture of newspaper clippings of articles prepared by the news service and articles written by others about the university. Many of the articles are from external clipping services, while others were collected by staff members from local publications such as the <title render="italic">Ann Arbor News</title> and <title render="italic">Michigan Daily</title>. Some press releases and press packets are included in the files long with occasional brochures and fliers. The arrangement maintained by the news office roughly mirrors the organization of the university. A wealth of material exists within these files. For tracking a unit or program area for a specific year, these files are particularly useful. However, locating information on specific events requires some advanced knowledge to make full use of these files. For example, articles about the apprehension of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski, a former graduate student in mathematics, are files under "Mathematics, Department of" in the 1996 Topical Files. Similarly, the 1995 Topical file for "Public Health, School of" includes material on Jonas Salk and the 40th anniversary of the Polio vaccine announcement.</p>

          <p>PRESS RELEASES (35 linear feet, 1945-1960, 1963-2008) reflect two different methods of organization. Press releases from 1945 to 1960 are arranged in a topical alphabet beginning with "admissions" and ending with "Willow Run Airport." Releases from 1945 to 1956 exist within one subseries, while releases for 1957 to 1958 exist as a separate alphabetically arranged subseries. Releases from 1959 to 1960 are fragmentary. Access to these alphabetical releases requires some understanding of what university unit or school/college handled particular activities and programs. For example, releases relating to the Polio vaccine are filed under "Public Health, School of." Press releases from 1963 to the present are arranged chronologically, requiring some knowledge of when particular evens occurred, or if taken as a whole reflect activity and achievements for particular periods of time. Spanish translations of press releases are included in the collection starting in November 2005.</p>

          <p>The GERALD R. FORD series (1 linear foot, 1934-2000) primarily consists of newspaper clippings, press releases, and other articles about Ford, which are arranged topically. The series documents Ford's career as congressman, Vice President, and President, and highlights other activities as well, including his service as adjunct professor at the University after his presidency, visits to the University, and the construction of the Gerald R. Ford Library. An outsize scrapbook from 1976 is housed separately. This scrapbook focuses on Gerald R. Ford's visit to the university.</p>

          <p>The UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS series (4 linear feet, 1950-2001) documents the service of University Presidents Harlan H. Hatcher, Robben W. Fleming, Harold T. Shapiro, James J. Duderstadt, Lee C. Bollinger, and the interim service of Homer Neal. The records contain press releases and other news coverage concerning the University's presidents and their involvement both on campus and with national and world affairs. The series is arranged topically by president, with the exception being Duderstadt, whose records are arranged topically but also include a series of press clippings arranged chronologically by month and year, mirroring their original arrangement. The topics covered vary from president to president, although there are similar recurring themes for each president, including their selection and inauguration, their departure, biographical information, and speeches or issued by the president. Other general recurring topics include affirmative action and discrimination and the growth and funding of the University.</p>

          <p>The MISCELLANEOUS series is an assemblage of isolated files and scrapbooks relating to specific projects, events, and individuals. Received on separate occasions, the material is physically dispersed throughout the record group. Files on "Project Submich" (Box 35) detail through clippings, reports, and other papers, a research submarine employed to study the Great Lakes in 1967. The Star II, built by General Dynamics, was a two man submarine supported by the United States Coast Guard cutter Woodbine. A small run of Cleland Wyllie topical files in Box 42 include a scrapbook and information on the donation of money and the Fair Lane property in Dearborn by the Ford family.</p>

Partnership 2000 was an Israeli -- United Jewish Appeal program that linked federated Jewish agencies throughout the United States with geographic units in Israel. Detroit was paired with Central Galilee. Partnership 2000's primary purpose was to foster links between American Jews and Israel, and foster cooperation with other institutions seeking reciprocal roles in improving the quality of life through social, academic, business, technical, and cultural links in the paired regions.</p>
