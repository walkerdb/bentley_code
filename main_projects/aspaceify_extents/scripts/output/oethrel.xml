      <p>Although the University of Michigan was never intended to be a sectarian school, from the beginning religion played a key role in its activities and curricula. Most of its first administrators and faculty were clergymen, starting with John Monteith and Gabriel Richard and continuing with Henry P. Tappan and Erastus Haven. In 1845, students formed the Union Society of Missionary Inquiry, which started out with a religious character but soon evolved into a kind of sectarian debating society. The students who were dissatisfied with the Union Society later formed a chapter of the Young Men's Christian Association. Established in January 1858, this association of the Y.M.C.A. was perhaps the first college chapter in the country.</p>
      <p>In 1859-1860, the organization rewrote its constitution and changed its name to the Students' Christian Association (name later changed to Student Christian Association in 1920). The SCA affiliated with the national Y.M.C.A. in 1866, but because of its willingness to accept women into its activities, the University of Michigan association never really fit the national Y model. Nevertheless, the SCA flourished, becoming the most active student organization at the University of Michigan in the period before the turn of the century with a broad-based program that included religious meetings and lectures, a monthly news bulletin, a program to orient new students to the university, an employment bureau, and a foreign missions program.</p>
      <p>The facilities used by the SCA in this early period were located in the South Wing of University Hall. In the period 1886-1890, funds were raised for a new building for SCA activities. This building - Newberry Hall - was dedicated for use on June 21, 1891 and was to serve as a center for campus religious activities for the next half century.</p>
      <p>The national Y.M.C.A. made repeated efforts to divide the SCA into a Y.M.C.A. and a Y.W.C.A. In 1895, some Michigan men did form a Y.M.C.A. chapter, but in 1897, an effort to restructure the SCA by dividing it into separate branches for men and women was defeated. Thus in 1901, to balance the Y.M.C.A. chapter, a Y.W.C.A. chapter was formed, giving the university community three student religious organizations, all of which prospered as separate entities for a time. But as they all needed separate funding for their support, they soon realized their need for cooperation. So in 1904, the 1897 plan of organization was revived and the SCA became the parent body to the two Y's with responsibility for the organization's home, Newberry Hall and with the university's Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. chapters becoming program centers. With this organizational restructuring, the religious focus of the SCA and its component organizations underwent a change. Discontinued were the prayer meetings, chapel services, and the monthly newsletter; in their place emphasis was given to secular projects such as a Freshman Handbook, a rooming agency, an employment bureau, and sex hygiene lectures. Because of the inadequacy of Newberry Hall for all of SCA's programs, a building campaign commenced in 1915 and with some support from John D. Rockefeller, enough money was raised for a new home for SCA. In 1917, Lane Hall, named in honor of Victor H. Lane, was opened.</p>
      <p>Ironically, just at the time of its greatest influence, the SCA experienced pressures that would eventually lead to its later restructuring and transformation into an entirely different kind of organization. The SCA now faced competition in its program offerings. Area churches began forming guilds to provide programs and services for students of their own denomination. The university, as well as the newly opened Michigan Union and Women's League took over functions that had gone to the SCA by default. The demise of SCA was a gradual one however as the organization sought to carve out a unique role for itself. During the 1920s, the organization managed a summer camp program for youngsters - the Fresh Air Camp - and began the Freshman Rendezvous retreat program to orient students to the religious resources of the campus.</p>
      <p>In the late 1920s, president Alexander Ruthven sought to define the role of religion at a secular state university. Realizing the importance of religion, the university created the position of Counselor in Religious Education (filled by Edward W. Blakeman) as a kind of mediator between the university and various religious groups and to counsel students on religious matters. In effect, the university was taking over some of the functions previously performed by the SCA. Because of its own financial difficulties, the SCA could no longer support Newberry Hall and Lane Hall and thus transferred these properties to the university. Although there was no stipulation about their use, it was hoped that they would continue as centers for religious study and activities. In 1936, the regents of the university agreed to take over the activities of SCA, creating a Board of Governors for Lane Hall and a new student organization, the Student Religious Association, established to stimulate and encourage interest in religion.</p>
      <p>The creation of the Student Religious Association was a signal that the university was now willing to accept responsibility for a student religious program. The change of name of the organization was also a reflection that the university had students of many faiths and that this new organization would strive to meet the needs of all of them. The constitution made clear that the work of the SRA would be separate from the counselor in religious education that President Ruthven had established, and that the board of governors of Lane Hall would have no jurisdiction over course offerings in religion. Although the distinctions in function were not always clear between the two units, the counselor in religious education was a university position with responsibility (as the name implied) for the religious counseling of students, while the SRA was (as the name also implied) a student organization whose responsibility was in the less easily defined areas of faith, values, and a student's spiritual life.</p>
      <p>The first director of the SRA was Kenneth Morgan. During his five-year tenure from 1937 to 1942, the SRA introduced a broad base of activities designed to provoke thought and discussion on religious issues. A series of formal lectures -- including a series on "The Existence and Nature of God," given by Bertrand Russell, Fulton Sheen, and Reinhold Niebuhr -- brought fifteen to eighteen speakers to campus per year. Additionally, SRA sponsored a freshman round table, a weekly discussion group, work holidays, local speakers, choirs, a music society, and book groups. Within the SRA was a bureau of student opinion, which surveyed students regarding their views about politics and religion in the period immediately prior to, during, and after World War II.</p>
      <p>As the SRA lost its exclusive Christian focus, Morgan sought to foster a spirit of cooperation among the major faiths on campus. Before that could take place there had to be a cohesive voice to speak for students of the Catholic, Jewish, or Protestant faiths. While Catholic and Jewish students had their own student centers, Protestant students were divided into various denominational guilds. Morgan sought to bring some unity to Protestants with the formation of the Inter-Guild Council. In addition, he created an Advisory Board consisting of representatives of the three major faiths to meet with SRA's Board of Governors to discuss religious problems of the university and to clarify relationships between the university and local religious groups.</p>
      <p>In 1947, the SRA underwent an organizational change. Lane Hall was recognized as the center for religious study and activities under the supervision of a Board of Directors. The board was to encourage student interest in religious study and was to maintain co-operation on behalf of the university with off-campus religious groups. The board was also to encourage and maintain within its jurisdiction the Student Religious Association as the student organization. In 1949, Edward Blakeman resigned as counselor in religious education, and his responsibilities were transferred to the Director of Lane Hall. In 1954, the title of the Director of Lane Hall was changed to Co-ordinator of Religious Affairs. The year 1955-56 brought a further re-evaluation of the university's provision for the religious life of its students by establishing the Office of Religious Affairs. The ORA was under the direction of the Co-ordinator of Religious Affairs who was responsible to the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Board of Governors for Religious Affairs. One of the Office of Religious Affairs' major activities was the Freshman Rendezvous, an orientation camp for incoming students to the university. Although the Rendezvous began before both the Student Religious Association and the Office of Religious Affairs were founded, it grew to its largest point under the direction of the Office of Religious Affairs. The Office of Religious Affairs also coordinated a committee on religion in the curriculum, which studied a degree program in religious studies, a program of university lectures on religion, a faculty colloquium on religion, and an improved library collection of religious works.</p>
      <p>The purpose and function of the Office of Religious Affairs was to provide the University of Michigan with a program of educational services in the field of religion. The office provided faculty and students with the opportunity to understand one's own faith as well as the faith of others in order that they be prepared to live in a multi-faith world. During the academic year 1971/72, the functions performed by the Office of Religious Affairs were folded into the Office of Special Services and Programs of the Office of the Vice President for Student Services. During the mid-1970s, the Ethics and Religion program was established to counsel students in matters of faith and morality. Specific areas of concern included sexuality and the male/female relationships of Afro-American students. The five areas of principal activity included: counseling, group education, public events, advising and advocacy, and community relations. In 1978 all religious counseling services were transferred to the Counseling Services Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs. The focus of the Office of Ethics and Religion shifted to include religious, spiritual and ethical development of the student through group facilitation and education programming. In 1993, the office was reorganized and down-sized. Currently the office is staffed part-time and the major focus is to serve as liaison with the campus ministries.</p>

      <p>The records have been divided into three principal organizational subgroups with two smaller groupings of genre (photographs and printed materials) that overlap the three organizational divisions. The bulk of the collection is almost equally divided between the records of the Student Christian Association and the Student Religious Association with a much smaller grouping of records for the Office of Religious Affairs.</p>
    </arrangement>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>Although the name given to this group of records is the University of Michigan Office of Ethics and Religion, the researcher should note that the records consist primarily of predecessor organizations, the Student Christian Association (SCA), the Student Religious Association (SRA), and the Office of Religious Affairs, as well as component and ancillary organizations such as the University of Michigan Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Association of Religious Counselors, and the Christian Federation Advisors.</p>
      <p>The record group begins with a summary history of the organization written by C. Grey Austin and entitled <title render="italic">A Century of Religion at the University of Michigan</title> (1957). Covering the period up to the establishment of the Office of Religious Affairs, this history provides solid information about the role of religion at the university and the activities and restructuring of the SCA and the SRA. Written by the same individual who wrote the sections on the two organizations in The University of Michigan; An Encyclopedic Survey, this volume is more detailed than those summaries and should be consulted first for background information.</p>

          <p>The first subgroup consists of the records of the Student Religious Association (1860-1937; 6 linear feet). This subgroup is divided into the following series: Historical File, Administration, Financial Records, Program Files, Component Organizations, Topical Files, and Scrapbooks and Clippings. The folder listing will make clear the contents of these various series, but the researcher might find the following of noteworthy interest. Within the Program Files are files of correspondence and other papers relating to the Bushrah mission, 1910-1916. The Student Christian Association, as was noted, had a powerful inclination toward missions work. One manifestation of that was its efforts through students to provide the people of Bushrah in the Persian Gulf with schools, a hospital, and a program of public health instruction. Unfortunately, the Bushrah program was interrupted by the coming of World War I and after that the energies of the SCA were focused on its own at-home needs for a new building and for programs directed specifically toward U-M students.</p>
          <p>The Component Organizations series is noteworthy for the records of the two Y organizations which during the first two decades of the twentieth century directed the programmatic efforts of the SCA. This series includes minutes of the two organizations as well as minutes of the SCA cabinet.</p>

          <p>The second major subgroup the in collection is the records of the Student Religious Association (1936-1956; 6 linear feet). The series within the SRA records include Administration, Program Files, Topical Files, Related Organizations, and Scrapbooks.</p>
          <p>Of special interest in the Program File series are files relating to the SRA's Lecture/Speakers Series and to the activities of its Bureau of Student Opinion . The SRA, particularly under the leadership of Kenneth Morgan was remarkably successful in bringing to campus many of the leading intellectuals of the day to speak on topics relating to religion. The Lecture/Speakers subseries in the Program File contains information about these lectures, including some transcripts of the papers delivered. Included are papers by <persname>Bertrand Russell</persname>, <persname>Fulton Sheen</persname> and <persname>Reinhold Niebuhr</persname> on "The existence and nature of God." The subseries "Bureau of Student Opinion" contains files of public opinion polls and student surveys regarding the student body's attitude toward a number of issues. Survey topics generally focus on an aspect of student attitudes toward people of different faiths, church attendance, or similar topics. The polls conducted immediately prior to and during World War II are especially interesting as they provide insight into public opinion on the political ideology of the Nazi regime concerning persons of the Jewish faith.</p>

          <p>The office of religious Affairs subgroup (1955-1968; 1 linear foot) consists of two series, Topical Files and Related Organizations. Within the latter series are notebooks of records documenting the activities of the Association of Religious Counselors, the Christian Federation Advisors, and the Board of Directors of Religious Affairs.</p>
          <p>In 1993, additional records were received from the Office of Ethics and Religion. Spanning the years 1912-1991 (bulk, 1965-1991), this accession includes records relating to predecessor organizations as well as the Office of Ethics and Religion. The records are divided into four series: Topical Files, Program Files, University Values Year, and Printed Works.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files (.8 linear feet) are composed of an alphabetical run of working files. The researcher will find the files sketchy, but indicative of the kinds of religious activities on the University of Michigan campus. Particularly well documented are the files of the University Interfaith Center, a corporation formed by the Association of Religious counselors in 1963. The files document the unsuccessful attempt to construct a religious facility on the north campus of the University of Michigan, which would have provided worship services, religious education, and counseling. Related information on this topic can be found within the "Association of Religious Counselors" files. For a complete summary of the activities of the OER on an annual basis, the researcher should consult the "Annual Reports" in Printed Works (box 14).</p>

            <p>The University Values Year series (.6 linear feet). contains information regarding the two-year cooperative venture that was concerned with the ethical dimensions of university life. Funded by President Robben Fleming, proposed by the University Council on Religious Affairs, and administered by the OER, this university-wide program was concerned with educating students about the ethical issues arising from scholarly life and practice. Through these files, the researcher can trace the program from "Imparting Values," a speech delivered by Robben Fleming (General, 1973-1974) to the several evaluative reports of the program.</p>
