      <abstract>The Integrated Premedical-Medical Program, commonly called Inteflex, combined undergraduate and medical school education into one specialized curriculum program at the University of Michigan. Inteflex was conceived to allow an integrated, flexible program through a liberal arts education offered by the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts while also obtaining a medical degree through the Medical School. Inteflex began as a six-year program in 1971, expanded to seven years in 1982, and again to eight years in 1994. The Inteflex program accepted its last entering group of students in 1998.</abstract>

      <p>Inteflex, or the Integrated Premedical-Medical Program, began as an alternative to the traditional path of obtaining a medical degree: four years of premedical education focusing on the sciences and matriculation to medical school. Inteflex combined and accelerated these into one program. Inteflex aimed to produce a more caring and humane, rather than what was seen as a disease-oriented, physician. One of the original pushes to start the program was a national concern over a shortage of doctors. There was also a widely held perception that doctors were not overly compassionate. Due to these reasons, there was ample funding to start a program that would focus on creating humane doctors at an accelerated rate. It was decided to test the theory that an education based on the arts, social sciences, and ethics would produce a more caring doctor.</p>
      <p>Inteflex distinguished itself by becoming an exclusive program offering openings for a limited number of LS&amp;A students, 50 or fewer per year. Although acceptance to the program and the course-load was intense, "flexies" had a supportive atmosphere. Many of the students lived together in East Quad, a move that staff hoped would foster cooperation rather than competition. Inteflex also had specialized premedical counselors to help with academic or personal issues. Students also did not have to compete for entrance into medical school since they were guaranteed entrance with their Inteflex status.</p>
      <p>Classes in the Inteflex program included a combination of standard LS&amp;A courses and smaller classes only for Inteflex students. The program attempted to reduce the redundancy between premedical preparation and medical school while offering an introduction to the arts and social sciences. The original six-year program contained 24 months of concentrated undergraduate education, two years of basic medical sciences in small Inteflex classes, and two years of clinical clerkship with standard medical students.</p>
      <p>One of the key Inteflex courses was Introduction to Patient Care, or the "preceptorship." This was a summer course that featured one-on-one work in a medical setting. The student was placed with a mentor doctor and worked along with him or her for two months. This took place the first summer at the university, exposing the students to patient care early in their medical training.</p>
      <p>Since the program began as an experiment, the program was constantly being evaluated. Students were questioned, tested, and evaluated with regularity. The curriculum changed with the results of the studies. Inteflex was also continually making adjustments to conform to curriculum changes and standards set by the Medical School and LS&amp;A. Inteflex leader made several adjustments to courses, requirements, length of study, and admissions over the years.</p>
      <p>The program became a total of seven years in 1982. The undergraduate portion lengthened to three years. Inteflex students studied basic sciences with standard medical students, however they used different schedules. Yearly class size also decreased from fifty incoming students to forty. These adjustments were made due to a number of factors. The intense six year program made it difficult for students to finish their requirements within the required time span. LS&amp;A required foreign language proficiency. It was often difficult for "flexies" to meet this requirement without previous instruction or advanced placement in high school. The initial national fervor to educate more doctors also declined. Funding for Inteflex also lessened at this time.</p>
      <p>Inteflex expanded program length again in 1994 following massive curriculum changes within the Medical School the previous year. The new medical curriculum was too different to accommodate the former Inteflex structure and as a result, it became an eight year program. The undergraduate portion became four years long. Admissions were lowered again, from 40 to 35 incoming students per year. Also, Inteflex students were now required to pass the MCAT medical school examination and have a combined MCAT/GPA score of a certain level before entrance into the Medical School. This was a first for the program since previously students, once admitted into Inteflex, moved right into Medical School without separate applications, assessment, or testing. This move was initiated by the Medical School after finding that Inteflex students generally had more difficulty in Medical School than students taking the standard path. At this time, Inteflex changed focus slightly to accommodate and support more minorities and students from rural areas. Attention was given to producing primary care physicians, a continuation of the hope for more compassionate doctors. The program now also allowed students a non-M.D. degree option.</p>
      <p>The program underwent close scrutiny in 1997. Reviewers included the Medical School, LS&amp;A, and Inteflex faculty as well as Inteflex students, counselors, alumni, and staff. After much consideration, it was determined that Inteflex was no longer making an enduring contribution to either LS&amp;A or the Medical School. The review committee decided that the curriculum was no longer innovative, the community was too stifling for the "real world" of medical school, and that Inteflex students were generally not academically better than regular medical students. Even though it was studied thoroughly, there was no final way of determining if the Inteflex program, with its small classes, individualized attention and focus on humanities, created a more compassionate doctor than students going through a traditional path. If they were using the family practice doctor as a resulting factor, then this did not prove to be the case. Most doctors who were "flexies" specialized in a particular branch as did most traditional students. The program accepted the last entering class in 1998, and Inteflex offices closed in 2002. The last group of "flexies" was scheduled to graduate Medical School in 2006.</p>

      <p>The Integrated Premedical-Medical Program (Inteflex) Records are divided into six series: Administrative, Committees, Curricula, Reports, Students, and Visual Materials. An earlier two linear foot collection came to the library in 1996. Due to the size of the accessions following the program's discontinuance, the older records were absorbed to make one holistic record group. Yearly classes are known by several names throughout the papers. The two most commonly used classifications are by the year the class entered Inteflex and also by the year of graduation from the Medical School. Classes may also be known by their status in the program, such as I4 meaning the student is in the fourth year of Inteflex. To create the least confusion possible, classes within the finding aid are filed under the Medical School graduation year.</p>

          <p>The series Committees, 1973-2000 (1.1 linear feet), documents the interdisciplinary nature of the Inteflex Program and its evolution. The Admissions Committee records the changing student demographics over time. The Inteflex Review Committee, formed of Inteflex, Medical School, and LS&amp;A faculty, examined the structure and progress of the Inteflex Program in 1993 and 1997. The progress is shown through correspondence, questionnaires, and reports. The Participating Faculty minutes report faculty and student solutions to internal Inteflex problems. The Policy Committee minutes contain high-level administration discussions about Inteflex policy. This subseries seems to continue under the name Steering Committee beginning in the 1990s. It is a particularly rich source of information on the Inteflex program evaluation containing detailed minutes, reports, and some correspondence.</p>

          <p>The series Reports, 1972-1999 (1.0 linear feet) compiles the multitude of studies conducted by the Inteflex, LS&amp;A, and Medical School faculty and committees. Many of the reports are student interview results describing their experiences, achievements, and satisfaction of the program. Some classes were interviewed at several stages within their academic careers. The results are arranged by the students' graduation year for clarity and consistency purposes. Many reports from the later years are in electronic format.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series, 1973-2002 (1.1 linear feet) contains scrapbook materials, photographs, and videotapes. One Inteflex scrapbook was created by Inteflex office staff. The rest of the clippings are loose materials collected with the intention of creating another scrapbook. Photographs are separated into faculty and staff, student life, and photograph albums. While there are few images of the administration, there are many photographs of students. There are formal and informal collages of class members under class photos. Snapshots of student activities are filed under yearly activities. There are also two photograph albums, one showing student life and the other containing images from students' internships (or preceptorships) with Michigan doctors. There are also three VHS videotapes in the records. Two videotapes are of special events: The annual charity I-Ball from 1997, and the 1998 Convocation. The third was created by students during the 1998 charity week. It follows students through dorms and classroom buildings for "Jail &amp; Bail" activities and also documents a charity auction aimed at Inteflex students.</p>
