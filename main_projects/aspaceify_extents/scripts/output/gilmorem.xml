      <p>Melvin Randolph Gilmore was born on March 11, 1868 in Valley, Nebraska. Gilmore's father was a farmer, and as a young man, Gilmore worked the farm with him. He also served as a teacher in a local school, not finishing college until he was in his thirties. He received a bachelor's degree from Cotner College (later Cotner University) in 1904. He received both of his graduate degrees in botany from the University of Nebraska, a master's degree in 1909 and a doctorate in 1914.</p>
      <p>Gilmore served as a professor of botany and zoology at Cotner University from 1904 to 1911. He then became curator at the Nebraska State Historical Society from 1911 to 1916. From 1916 to 1923 Gilmore served as curator of the museum at the State Historical Society of North Dakota. He served on the staff of the Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian from 1923 to 1928. After most of the staff at the museum were abruptly let go due to financial difficulties in 1928, Gilmore moved to Michigan and worked as a landscape designer for the Kellogg Nature Preserve in Battle Creek. Gilmore was then hired as the first Curator of Ethnology for the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan in 1929. He was later given the additional title of Director of the Ethnobotanical Laboratory in 1938.</p>
      <p>Gilmore was one of the preeminent ethnobotanists of his generation. He was one of the first researchers to recognize the enormous botanical knowledge of Native Americans and to take it as his primary area of study. Much of Gilmore's ethnographic and ethnobotanical field work was done working among the Arikara (also known as the Sahnish), an agricultural Native American tribe based around the upper Missouri River. Gilmore also researched and spent time with a number of other Native American groups on the Prairies and Plains, including the Pawnee and the Omaha. Gilmore's most well-known publication was <title render="italic">Uses of Plants by the Indians of the Missouri River Region</title>, first published by the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1919 and considered a classic of the field. Other major publications included <title render="italic">Prairie Smoke</title> (Columbia University Press, 1929), a collection of Native American myths, and the pamphlet <title render="italic">Indian Lore and Indian Gardens</title> (Slingerland-Comstock Co., 1930).</p>
      <p>Gilmore's most significant accomplishment at Michigan was the establishment of the Ethnobotanical Laboratory, which began operation in 1930. Founded with support from the National Research Council, the laboratory served as a national center for the identification of archaeological vegetal material. Unfortunately, Gilmore was in poor health for much of his tenure at the university, and was not able to get very far with the work of the lab. By the mid-1930s he had ceded most of his museum and lab responsibilities to his assistant, Volney Jones, though he retained his museum titles until 1939.</p>
      <p>Gilmore died on July 25, 1940 in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series, 1908-1938 (0.75 linear feet), contains incoming and outgoing professional correspondence. The series includes letters written and received during Gilmore's tenures with Cotner University, the Nebraska State Historical Society, the State Historical Society of North Dakota, the Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian, and the University of Michigan. The series is arranged alphabetically by correspondent, with a folder of miscellaneous correspondence at the end of each letter range.</p>
          <p>Gilmore's correspondence consists mainly of discussions with amateur and professional ethnobotanists and anthropologists about their research, field work, and laboratory results. Gilmore was particularly interested in Native American groups, so a good deal of his correspondence relates to ethnographic and ethnobotanical studies of various facets of the lives of different Native American populations. Correspondents of note include A.B. Stout, J.J. Thornber, George F. Will, John R. Swanton, and Francis La Flesche. Gilmore's correspondence with Fay-Cooper Cole includes discussions of preparations for an ethnographic exhibit for the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago (additional information on this project can be found in the Research, Writing and Field Work series). Aaron McG. Beede's letters to Gilmore include ethnographic notes from the former's missionary work among the Native American groups of North Dakota. A small amount of correspondence related to specific areas of Gilmore's research can be found in the individual manuscript and topical files of the Research, Writing and Field Work series.</p>

          <p>The Research, Writing and Field Work series, ca. 1912-1930 (2.5 linear feet), is comprised of Gilmore's ethnographic and ethnobotanical field notes, bibliographic research and writing. The series is divided into three subseries, Topical Files, Individual Manuscripts, and Field Notebooks and Loose Notes. (Because Gilmore maintained several parallel filing systems, there is some duplication of content across the subseries.) Most of the material is undated, but appears to have been created and compiled mainly while Gilmore was working at the State Historical Society of North Dakota and the Museum of the American Indian (1916 to 1923 and 1923 to 1928, respectively). Smaller amounts of earlier and later material are also included.</p>

            <p>The Topical Files subseries includes field notes, bibliographic research, and manuscripts related to particular areas of study. Some files also include related correspondence. Of particular note are Gilmore's files on the Arikara, Omaha, and Pawnee, which are rich in primary and secondary source materials. A small amount of more administrative material can also be found in the subseries, including a file related to Gilmore's work for the Heye Foundation with correspondence from Gilmore to George Heye regarding field work and purchases for the Museum of the American Indian, and notes for reports on Gilmore's activities at the University of Michigan.</p>

            <p>The Individual Manuscripts subseries includes drafts and supporting research for various articles and publications by Gilmore and others. Most are brief accounts by Gilmore of various Native American practices and myths, many of which were published in Gilmore's monograph <title render="italic">Prairie Smoke</title> and in the Heye Foundation's <title render="italic">Indian Notes</title> serial. A few longer manuscripts may also be found in the subseries, most notably Gilmore's reference copy of <title render="italic">Uses of Plants by the Indians of the Missouri River Region</title>. The subseries also includes several manuscripts by authors other than Gilmore. Oliver La Mere's "Origin of the Great Mystery Lodge of the Winnebago" includes correspondence from the author to Gilmore, while Elizabeth McCollum's "A Collection of Local Materials Suitable for Use in Teaching Indian Life in Peru, Nebraska" includes Gilmore's handwritten corrections. "Western Sioux Cosmology" was written by Aaron McG. Beede, the North Dakota missionary and amateur ethnologist with whom Gilmore had a strong professional partnership.</p>

            <p>The Field Notebooks and Loose Notes subseries is comprised of seven field notebooks, a folder of loose field notebook pages, and seven folders of index cards and looseleaf notes. The folders of loose notes include bibliographic references, information on professional contacts, and Gilmore's notes from secondary sources, as well as his notes from the field. The notes range from typed pages similar to what can be found in the Topical Files subseries to scraps of index cards and loose paper with Gilmore's handwriting. The materials found in both the notebooks and the loose notes form the basis for many of the manuscripts found in the Topical Files and Individual Manuscripts subseries.</p>
            <p>The field notebooks document Gilmore's work with the Arikara and other Native American groups. The largest dates from 1917 to 1926 and includes Gilmore's interview and observational notes from work with Native American groups in North and South Dakota. A smaller notebook dates from 1926 to 1932 and is labeled "Onondaga," but appears to continue the Dakotas field work from the previous notebook. A third notebook is from 1923 and includes notes on the Arikara and Omaha, as well as lists of materials to be purchased for the Museum of the American Indian. One small field notebook contains notes Gilmore made about Michigan. Several smaller field notebooks also contain information on these topics.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series, ca. 1905-1930 (1 linear foot), provides a visual record of Gilmore's professional and personal interests. The series includes black and white prints of varying sizes, a small number of negatives and two photograph albums. More than half of the loose photos are unlabeled as to date or subject, though many also appear in the photograph albums, often with captions. The loose photographs have been arranged into broad subject groupings; there is no apparent order to the photographs within each heading, though the ordering in which they were received has been retained when possible. Ethnographic subjects include Native American people, Native American reservations and missions, medicine bundles, corn and other plants, and an Arikara fish trap. Photos of the American Ethnobotanical Garden Gilmore designed for the Museum of the American Indian can also be found in the series. In addition to photos related to his professional work, the series also includes many portraits and candid photos of Gilmore, his friends, and his professional acquaintances.</p>
          <p>The two photograph albums measure 6" x 4.5" and 11" x 7", respectively. Both include black and white photos, most with captions. The smaller album has a caption on the inside front cover that reads "An Album of Views Taken by M.R. Gilmore on the Omaha Indian Reservation, Northeast Nebraska" and is dated 1905 to 1906. The photos in the larger album date from 1920 to 1925 and cover an array of subjects.</p>
