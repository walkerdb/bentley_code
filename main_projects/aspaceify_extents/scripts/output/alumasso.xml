        <emph render="bold">Alumni Association</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Alumni activities at the University of Michigan began almost as soon as there were alumni. The Society of Alumni was formed in 1845, immediately after the first commencement. At first the society accepted graduates of any college as members, but by 1853 it had defined itself as the alumni organization of the University of Michigan, and specifically of the Literary College. The society combined social activity with promotion of the interests of the University in its early years, but was not particularly important to the running of the University. In 1874, however, the society began to take a more active role, establishing the Williams professorship fund, which was used for the support of retired professors.</p>
      <p>In the 1870s alumni of the professional schools began to organize their own societies, law alumni in 1871, the Association of Medical Alumni in 1875, and dentistry, pharmacy, and homeopathic medicine alumni by 1884. After a financial scandal in the Society of Alumni came to light in 1889, a movement began to consolidate all the alumni societies, in order to improve confidence in the organizations. In 1897 the societies were combined into the Alumni Association.</p>
      <p>The new society soon began to expand its activities. It bought the Michigan Alumnus, a private publication founded in 1894, to serve as its official organ. The number of local alumni clubs was expanded and an endowment fund was established to support the association's activities.</p>
      <p>Although the University began to support the Alumni Association financially during Shirley W. Smith's tenure as secretary of the association (1901-1904), the University's support of the association increased greatly with the appointment of Harry Burns Hutchins to the presidency of the University in 1910. Hutchins saw the association as a potentially important source of funds for the University. The Association's ties with the University's development activities became even stronger after World War II, when the Phoenix Project, the $55 Million campaign, and other campaigns relied heavily on alumni support.</p>
      <p>In 1923 the structure of the association was changed, with the local alumni chapters becoming the basic units of the organization. At this time a field secretary was also appointed, to stimulate the development of the local chapters and organization of districts.</p>
      <p>By the end of the 20th century the Alumni Association boasted more than 104,000 members. The mission statement described the association as "an independent worldwide organization that nurtures lifelong relationships with and among current and future Michigan alumni. As a committed partner of the University, the Association offers programs of relevance and service to alumni and creates support for the University. Underlying all that we do is the belief in the value of education to the well-being of society, and a commitment to integrity, diversity, and service." Activities include organizing alumni excursions and lecture tours, coordinating reunions, operating a career assistance network, and offering lifelong learning opportunities.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Alumnae Council</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Until 1914, when an alumnae representative was added to the board of directors of the Alumni Association, alumnae were not organized at the university level. A number of alumnae clubs had been organized in various localities, but there was no central organization. In 1917 a Central Coordinating Committee was formed as a part of the Alumni Association, to allow alumnae to support the needs of women students. At that time, the University was the first co-educational institution to be represented at an Alumnae Conference held in Washington, D.C. Prior to the establishment of the university organization, however, University of Michigan alumnae took an active role in the building of the national Association of Collegiate Alumnae, now referred to as the American Association of University Women. Alice Freeman Palmer, President of Wellesley College, (1876, Ph.D. hon, 1882) was one of three University of Michigan women who established the Association in 1882 in conjunction with women from the University of Wisconsin, Oberlin College, Boston University, Cornell, Vassar, Smith, and Wellesley.</p>
      <p>The original University of Michigan organization functioned as a central correspondence committee whose purpose was to keep in touch with the needs and life of women at the university and report activities to the alumnae. In the first year, there were 14 alumnae groups in various cities throughout the United States. The first meeting of all University of Michigan alumnae was held in 1917 in Ann Arbor to discuss projects for the organization to undertake that were important to the University's women. From that meeting came the plans to fund and construct Alumnae House, the first women's residence.</p>
      <p>In 1920, the central correspondence committee changed its name to the Alumnae Council of the Alumni Association to better reflect the growing function of the committee as an integral part of the Alumni Association. It was also decided to admit representatives from each of the alumnae groups to the Council. In 1921 a constitution for the organization was adopted. It was also in 1921 that the Council began a campaign to raise $1,000,000 for a women's building to meet the social as well as the educational requirements for women on campus. By 1926, the money was raised and in 1928 the cornerstone was laid for the Michigan League building.</p>
      <p>In 1930, the Council began a program in cooperation with the Graduate School to aid women with financial needs. The first graduate endowment fund established was the Lucy Elliot Fellowship. This was soon followed by the Alice Crocker Lloyd Fellowship. The Henderson House, a women's cooperative dormitory, was also established, with residence based on scholastic achievement. The Council continues to sponsor scholarships for women in addition to other fellowships and loans.</p>
      <p>The Council's activities remained somewhat independent of those of the Alumni Association until 1955, when an attempt was made to integrate alumnae activities into those of the Association.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series (boxes 1-67) spans the period from 1897, when the various alumni and professional societies were combined into the Alumni Association, through 1967. The basic arrangement of the correspondence is in chronological periods and thereunder in a basic alphabetical sequence. The bulk of the correspondence is that of the Alumni Association General Secretary (later Executive Director) although correspondence of field secretaries and other alumni officers is also present. Subject access to the correspondence is largely non-existent. In order to make use of these records some familiarity with key individuals or events in the history of the university is required. Much of the correspondence is routine in nature, pertaining to more mundane matters like payment of dues, subscriptions to the Michigan Alumnus and requests for football tickets. Interspersed among the mundane letters, however, are news items and reminiscences from alumni, information on various class memorials and responses to various Alumni Association requests such as names of alumni who fought in the Civil War, Spanish American War and later wars. Information on films and recordings detailing the work of the university which were made available to alumni groups is also interspersed among the correspondence.</p>
          <p>Of particular note is correspondence surrounding the building of Alumni Memorial Hall (now the Art Museum). Built during 1908-1910, the planning, design, and intended use of the building was frequently discussed during the years from 1903 to 1912. Much of this discussion and fundraising took place at the same time a similar campaign was underway for the Michigan Union. Conflict between the two proposals as well as confusion among alumni solicited for funds by both campaigns is evident in the correspondence covering this period. Issues of the Michigan Alumnus during this period also help to frame the issues surrounding this controversy. Additional documentation on building projects is available in the Special Projects and Subjects series. Other key eras such as World War II are reflected in extensive correspondence with alumni in the armed services. The Alumni Club File (Boxes 68-96) and Alumnae Club File (Boxes 111-113) series covers the years 1923-1957. The records are arranged alphabetically by the name of the cities or countries in which alumni/alumnae clubs were in operation. Material in these files pertains to the development and organizations of these clubs and gives evidence of the programming undertaken by the clubs and their relations with the overall Alumni Association. Correspondence with alumni/alumnae in the various cities is included in these files although much of it is routine in nature. Researchers interested in alumni activities in a particular location should note that information on that location may overlap between the two different sequences (i.e., Akron, Ohio in Box 68 and Box 111).</p>

          <p>The Alumni Club Files (Boxes 68-96) and Alumnae Club Files (Boxes 111-113) series covers the years 1923-1957. The records are arranged alphabetically by the name of the cities or countries in which alumni/alumnae clubs were in operation. Material in these files pertains to the development and organizations of these clubs and gives evidence of the programming undertaken by the clubs and their relations with the overall Alumni Association. Correspondence with alumni/alumnae in the various cities is included in these files although much of it is routine in nature. Researchers interested alumni activities in a particular location should note that information on that location may overlap between the two different sequences (i.e., Akron, Ohio in Box 68 and Box 111).</p>

        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>Alumnae Council Files (Boxes 114-117, 131-133) include general material on the council which was formed to keep up to date with the needs and life of women at the University of Michigan and to report those activities to alumnae. Records reflect the early distinction made between alumni and alumnae and detail the operation of the council and efforts to aid women students with financial needs as well as the operation of the Michigan League. (See also the Michigan League Building Fund Campaign Files in boxes 105-108, the 1924 Alumnae Council Survey Questionnaire in boxes 109-110, and the Alumnae Club File in boxes 111-113). Information on Henderson House, a women's cooperative dormitory sponsored by the Alumnae Council is also present. Later records reflect efforts to integrate the separate alumnae activities into the larger operation of the Alumni Association. Of particular note are several files relating to women students and alumnae involved in World War II military service and war work (located in boxes 114-115). These files include accounts of military service, articles about work in locations such as the Willow Run Bomber Plant, and photographs of alumnae in service (WACS, WAVES, Red Cross). An index card file compiles information on alumnae involved in military service.</p>
          <p>Related to the Alumnae Council files are the Marjorie Williams Papers (.5 linear feet; 1958-1962) which consist of administrative records pertaining to the work of the Alumnae Council during the latter part of the 1950s and the early 1960s. The folders are arranged alphabetically by topic with the items in each folder arranged chronologically. The majority of the records are minutes and reports of workshops, functions and special committees of the council. The largest folder, "Correspondence", contains letters to and from the Alumni Association and the Alumnae Secretary, Allison Myers, as well as other groups and organizations. The letters give information about the day-to-day workings of the organization not seen in the minutes and reports. Of interest is the folder containing information on the Alice Freeman Palmer Professor Committee. Dr. George H. Palmer gave an endowment to the Alumnae Council to establish a chair in the history department in the name of his wife. The full time position was approved in 1958, with Dr. Sylvia L. Thrupp as the first appointee. The folder contains a newsletter about Dr. Thrupp and the endowment.</p>
          <p>Connected with the work of the Alumnae Council is the 1924 Alumnae Council Survey Questionnaire. As part of the effort to establish the Michigan League surveys were sent to every woman that had attended the university up to 1924. The survey questionnaires asked for biographical information as well as occupations, leadership positions, and queried alumnae to consider who were the ten most influential alumnae. Returned questionnaires are located in boxes 109-110. An index, including cross references to maiden names is contained in a separate volume. Additional biographical and genealogical information on alumnae is available in the separate University of Michigan. Alumni Records. Necrology File record group. This record groups includes an extensive name index of former students and graduates.</p>
          <p>A similar alumni survey was contemplated in 1927. The 1927 Alumni Survey (located in Box 130) contains the partial results of this effort to contact every graduate and former student that had attended the university. To test the feasibility of such a vast undertaking surveys were sent to all alumni with surnames beginning with the letters "A" and "B." Approximately 60% of the surveys were completed and returned. Realizing how costly it would be to complete the rest of the survey, the undertaking was abandoned. Among the biographical information asked in the survey was occupation, activities, community work, and sources of income. An index to the extant surveys is contained in a separate volume along with the 1924 alumnae survey index. Additional biographical and genealogical information on alumni is available in the separate University of Michigan. Alumni Records. Necrology File record group. This record groups includes an extensive name index of former students and graduates.</p>

          <p>The Society of Alumni series contains records of this precursor to the Alumni Association. The society was initially open to graduates of all the schools and colleges but eventually was defined as the alumni organization of the literary college. Often the society functioned as a coordinating body for the loose confederation of societies formed by the other schools and colleges while also administering the Williams Professorship Fund. Records of the society include minutes, 1859-1897, a receipt book, letter book, and assorted early records including a compilation of alumni news articles appearing in campus publication from 1845 to 1892. The minutes include necrology reports on members of the universities early classes. Also included is a minute book of the Medical Alumni Association covering 1875-1897.</p>

          <p>The Alumni Association records also include material on several Special Projects and Subjects. These records remain unprocessed but nonetheless contain a wealth of information on several significant projects and issues such as the planning and construction of Alumni Memorial Hall, Michigan Union, and the Michigan League. Three unprocessed boxes of Michigan League Building Fund Campaign Files from 1921 to 1926 are located in boxes 105-108. Material in boxes 126-129 includes background on the plans for a memorial to President Marion L. Burton ultimately resulting in construction of a carillon. Some of the other subjects include information on the Williams Professorship Fund used to support retired professors, the Michigan Alumnus, celebration of the 75th anniversary of the University of Michigan in 1912, opposition to the name change of Michigan State University from Michigan Agricultural College, and various alumni and scholarship funds. Interspersed among these records are financial records of the Alumni Association. Material on the "Committee of One Hundred" in Box 104 relates to an effort to organize alumni to protest proposed cuts to university funding in 1933.</p>

The photos range form 1x2-inch to 8x10 prints, nearly all of them black and white. The photos are organized into several groups: University Buildings, Non-University Buildings, Subjects; and Individuals.</p>

            <p>University Buildings (Boxes 135-136) includes both exterior and interior photos of buildings on the Ann Arbor campus and off-campus university buildings. Many photos of building construction are found here. The interior photos generally show the activities that took place in the buildings, and so overlap the Subjects subseries below.</p>

          <p>The Class Reunion Files series spans the period 1924 to 1993 and contains information on classes from 1894 to 1963. The series is arranged by classes according to the years in which they graduated. Much of the material reflects the mechanics or organizing reunions, but news on class members and lists of former students are often present in these files. Genealogists will find much of this material of value.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series includes one item from 1847 but otherwise spans the period from 1909 to 1998. The files are alphabetically arranged and cover a wide array of topics. The 1847 item is a receipt for room rent issued to Charles Beckwith of the class of 1849. The Beckwith folder also includes a biographical sketch written in 1941. There is considerable information on scholarships, fellowships and funds supported by the Alumni Association and Alumnae Council. Several of the files on individual funds and endowments include information on who the fund or endowment is named after. Some student reminiscences are include within this series detailing university life prior to 1900. Notable files include material on the founding date of the university (located in the Frank Culver file), Milton Berger's description of Japanese surrender on Okinawa in 1945, and certificates chartering the first alumni club on the moon. The moon chapter folder contains information about the Apollo 15 space mission comprised of University of Michigan alumni James B. Irwin, David R. Scott, and Alfred M. Worden, Jr.</p>

          <p>The Audio Tapes series (Box 161) consists of reel-to-reel tape recordings of musical performances, dedications, interviews, and radio programs dating from 1960 to 1982. The tapes include performances by the Glee Club, Marching Band, and Amaizin' Blues. Sports-related tapes include two reels of "Football Report" from 1960 and 1961 containing interviews with former football coach and athletic director Fritz Crisler discussing substitution rules and other football topics. Equipment manager Henry Hatch also discusses changes in equipment and uniforms during his 42-year career. Other selections include a discussion of the Phoenix Memorial Project and atomic energy by professors Ralph Sawyer and Henry Gomberg.</p>
