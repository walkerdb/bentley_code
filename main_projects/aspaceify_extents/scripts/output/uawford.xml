      <p>The United Auto Workers-Ford Motor Company (UAW-Ford) University was an outgrowth of programs in the School of Social Work that provided educational counseling to UAW members in Ford plants. In 1996, following a UAW-Ford collective bargaining agreement calling for "a new program dedicated to a university-style approach to workplace education and training," the Institute for Labor and Industrial Relations (ILIR), and the UM-Dearborn College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters (CASL) responded with the "Work, Technology and Society Program." This distance education program is now centered at UM-Dearborn.</p>
      <p>One of the key parts of UAW-Ford University was the development of a liberal arts degree program oriented to the auto industry, with plant-based educational programming and distance learning. This project began in 1997, and by Fall of 1998 courses in a new degree program were being offered on a pilot basis in three auto plants. The plan was to expand the project to additional plants, eventually making courses available throughout the UAW-Ford system nationally. The University of Michigan drew upon the resources of both its Ann Arbor and Dearborn campuses in developing this program.</p>
      <p>The process of developing the degree program began with a union-management team from the UAW-Ford National Programs Center and a group of faculty and staff at the university. Plant-level studies were undertaken with local plants while a faculty advisory committee lead the curriculum development process within the university.</p>
      <p>Several principles set the stage for development. First, there was general agreement that the courses should use Internet technologies with the goal of becoming an online, virtual university. Second, two-way video technology would be used as a transitional approach. Third, courses on CD-ROM and the Internet would be developed as models to be tested for future expansion. Technology was a key instrument for the program. All of the courses were to use computer applications for assignments, access to research collections, class discussion, communications with professors, and other traditional parts of the curriculum.</p>
      <p>Student support services was a key area for the implementation of the distance learning enterprise. Three resources for students support services are part of the program: Education Training Coordinators (ETC), Skills Enhancement Program (SEP), and Education Resource Specialists (ERS). The ETCs were in-plant education advisor who aided in recruiting and registering students and provided a range of individualized support. The SEP was an in-plant education center which provides general educational support and assistance with computer skills. Finally, the ERSs were advisors from the University of Michigan who worked directly with the UAW-Ford University program, providing academic advising. They also had a range of administrative and program development responsibilities. The ERSs, working with SEPs and ETCs, formed a network of support staff that engages in active outreach to provide assistance to students.</p>
      <p>The UAW Ford University is now a virtual university with a network of accredited colleges and universities that offer courses, certificates, and various degree options using the latest technologies to expand educational opportunities offered to UAW-represented employees. http://www.uawford.com/UFU/Intro.cfm</p>
      <p>* Much of the information contained in this history was taken from <title render="italic">"Long Summary</title>" in the History and Proposals series, and the <title render="italic">University Record</title> article "Units collaborate to offer on-site or at-home courses for Ford workers," October 11, 1999.</p>

      <p>The UAW-Ford University record group covers the period from 1995 to 2001 and primarily represents the involvement of the University of Michigan School of Social Work in the development and early administration of the UAW-Ford University and efforts at developing educational counseling and distance education programs. Materials include planning files, CD-ROMs containing examples of curriculum and resources, and various proposals and reports. The records are organized into five series: History and Proposals, Reports, Meetings, Plant-level Studies and Educational Resources.</p>
