      <p>Wilma T. Donahue, born December 4, 1900, earned three degrees at the University of Michigan: her AB in 1926; an MA in 1927; and a Ph.D. in psychology in 1937. She began her career at the University of Michigan at the Bureau of Psychological Services in 1935. Beginning in 1945, Donahue worked at the Institute for Human Adjustment (IHA), where she continued to work in a variety of capacities until 1965. At the same time, she taught and carried out research on aging. By 1965 Donahue had established her position as an authority on gerontology, as reflected by her role as chair of the Division of Gerontology.</p>
      <p>In 1965 the State of Michigan established the Institute of Gerontology, a joint venture between the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. As the co-director of the Institute in Ann Arbor, Donahue capped her long career as educator and administrator in Michigan. She retired from the University of Michigan in 1970, but continued her crusade to improve the status of the aging by serving as director of the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>Donahue's career as a gerontologist spans five decades: from the late 1940s, when academics first became aware of the growing size of the aged sector of the population, to the 1980s, when the "graying of America" became an accepted feature of the social landscape. Her career was not merely academic; she took her knowledge before the legislative powers of the state and nation in her effort to secure an equitable share of social welfare for the aging. She has worked closely with government agencies and professional organizations to improve both the standard of living of older Americans and the understanding of the process of aging.</p>
      <p>Wilma Donahue continued to be active in geriatric scholarship until her death in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in August 1993. During her long life, her interests included many facets of aging, from housing and economic security to the physical and psychological aspects inherent in the aging process. The full scope of her work can only be grasped by reading her curriculum vitae, but a sense of it can be glimpsed through the titles of some of the works she edited or wrote: Housing and the Aging (1954); Earning Opportunities for Older Workers (1955); Aging and Social Health in the U.S. and Europe (1959); Social and Psychological Aspects of Aging (1962); A Therapeutic Milieu for Geriatric Patients (1969); Adequacy of Federal Response to Housing Needs of Older Americans (1975); White House Conferences as Agents of Social Change (1979); and Aging in the 1980s and Beyond (1981).</p>

      <p>The Wilma T. Donahue papers document her career as a teacher, researcher, and administrator at the University of Michigan. The papers span the years 1945-1990 with the bulk of the material falling within the two decades bound by 1949-1969. The Donahue papers are a subset of the Michigan Historical Collections/Institute of Gerontology Joint Archives in Gerontology and can best be understood as an integral element of that larger set.</p>
      <p>The Donahue papers provide a clear insight to the development of the field of gerontology as an academic discipline and as an area of concern for policy makers and the general public. The earliest files reflect Donahue's training as a psychologist as it relates to her research on testing, returning veterans, and the blind. In the late 1940s Donahue and Clark Tibbitts began to research and publish articles on the aging population in America. Donahue's papers reflect this new interest as the focus of her writings now turns to issues of aging: housing, mental and physical health, adult education, and the economics of retirement. These issues dominated Donahue's research for twenty years and her papers document her increasing stature as an influential figure in gerontology at the state and national levels, especially her involvement with the University of Michigan Annual Conferences on Gerontology, the Michigan Commission on Aging, and her "cutting edge" research on housing the aging.</p>
      <p>The collection came to the library in different accessions and from different sources. Although there is some overlap, the files as received represent distinct series. These series are Articles, Conferences, Addresses and Meetings, 1949-1970; Professional Activities and Affiliations, 1953-1970; Research Projects, 1955-1971; University of Michigan: Administration and Teaching, 1946-1968; Videotapes: White House Conferences as Agents of Social Change, 1979; International Center for Social Gerontology; and Miscellaneous.</p>

          <p>Articles, Conferences, Addresses and Meetings, 1949-1970 [boxes 1-14]. Arranged chronologically regardless of type of material, this series is comprised of heterogeneous files. Correspondence, lecture notes, topical files, printed material, speeches, and rough drafts are filed by date of creation or presentation. Donahue created a new folder for each correspondent and for each time she delivered a speech; hence these files include multiple copies of addresses given at different times and places to various groups. This heterogeneity and redundancy may present problems for the researcher, but the preservation of original order (in all its diversity) gives the researcher a sense of Donahue's productivity and industry. One caveat: the bulk of the materials from 1949 to 1954 (boxes 1-3) were part of a later accession to the Institute of Gerontology archives. These are interfiled with the material processed earlier. Given the diversity of materials in this series, the best way to make sense of the materials is to refer to Donahue's curriculum vita (in the front of box 1) and to her appointment calendars (in box 14) to discern which topics might be covered in any time span.</p>

          <p>Professional Activities and Affiliations, 1953-1970 [boxes 14-16]. This series was originally organized chronologically, but has been reordered into an alphabetical series, arranged by organization or commission, to facilitate research. This series provides the best evidence of Donahue's importance and involvement at the state level in shaping public policy for the aging. The rising importance of gerontological issues in the public policy arena can be seen in the transition of the Michigan Legislative Advisory Council on the Problems of Aging to the Michigan Commission on Aging. This evolution reveals the willingness of state policy-makers (especially Governor Romney) to commit funds and institutions to dealing with the problems of aging. Donahue's responsibilities evolved in a similar manner as she came to take on more administrative roles within the institution of the Michigan Commission on Aging. Hence, these are the most revealing files in this series.</p>

          <p>Research Projects, 1955-1971 [boxes 17-18]. This series primarily covers Donahue's research on various nursing homes for the aging, Lurie Terrace as low-cost housing for the aging, and the work potentials of older people in medical care facilities. It is comprised of budgets, correspondence, memos, interim and final reports, grant applications, rough drafts, and tables for reports. The material is arranged alphabetically by project and research activity. Case files and preliminary reports rendered redundant by extant final reports have been removed. The Fairmount, Galesburg, Jackson, and Washtenaw projects are part of the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation study and should be viewed as complementary units. The Lurie Terrace material reflects the realization of Donahue's ideas on housing the elderly and is revealing in demonstrating her principles made real. Donahue's groundbreaking work in Milieu Therapy is documented in the Rehabilitation of Newly-Admitted Geriatric Mental Hospital Patients files.</p>

          <p>University of Michigan: Administration and Teaching, 1946-1968 [boxes 19-20]. This series is divided in two subseries. The first deals with Donahue's administrative duties and is arranged in rough chronological order. Given the extended nature of some of these duties, there is some overlap of years. The second subseries documents her teaching career from 1949 to 1960. The chronological sequence here is dictated by the semester schedule of the university. Some of the administrative materials concern Donahue's years at the Bureau of Psychological Services, but they primarily concern her career as a gerontologist. Again, Donahue's increasing responsibilities over time can be seen by comparing the Institute for Human Adjustment files with the Division of Gerontology files. The president's reports for the Institute for Human Adjustment offer her reflections on year-to-year accomplishments and goals. The manuscripts of Living through the Older Years (1949) and Aging and Mental Health (1966), both edited by Donahue, are part of these files. The Teaching subseries documents very well the early years of Donahue's career, but the materials diminish quickly in quantity and quality after 1954.</p>

          <p>Videotapes: White House Conferences as Agents of Social Change, 1979 [boxes 21-22]. This series consists of videotapes of some of the proceedings of a May 30-June 1, 1979, conference organized by Donahue. The conference attracted some of the leading lights in the field of gerontology. Unfortunately some of the videotapes are less useful than they might have been because of uneven editing of the tapes. The Institute of Gerontology has listed the speakers and discussants at the conference sessions on videotape; these lists can be found in boxes 21 and 22.</p>

          <p>International Center for Social Gerontology [boxes 23-25] documents Donahue's professional activities 1973-1982 when she was director of this Washington, D.C. agency. The files are arranged alphabetically by topic and primarily contain material on efforts to improve housing for the elderly during the 1970s. The many grant applications in this series are good sources of information, because they provide explanations of the intent and scope of the many programs designed by the ICSG.</p>
          <p>The first program undertaken by the ICSG was the 1973 "International Symposium on Housing and Environmental Design for Older Adults." One outcome of the symposium was a study of congregate housing in the United States and Western Europe. Congregate housing provides housing for older adults who require some personal assistance and housekeeping services but do not require the medical care provided by a nursing home. A second outcome was the formation of the International Clearinghouse Study Committee on Housing and Environmental Planning for Older Adults (1974-1975). The International Clearinghouse studied methods for improving the dissemination of information resources in the areas of aging, housing, environmental planning, as well as how these resources were used.</p>
          <p>From 1973 to 1977 the ICSG was involved in developing and promoting a Vacation Residential Exchange Program for Older Adults. The program offered travel opportunities for older adults who lived in public housing. From 1975 to 1978 the ICSG developed sheltered housing in Maryland. Sheltered housing is congregate housing for older semi-independent adults. The Maryland program was later expanded into a national program, the Housing Technical Assistance Program (H-TAP). H-TAP developed educational materials on and offered training in housing the aged for state and local agencies. The program ran from 1977 to 1982.</p>
          <p>The last significant project undertaken by the ICSG under Donahue's leadership was a 1979 symposium titled "White House Conferences as Agents for Social Change." The symposium provided input for the congressionally-mandated 1981 White House Conference on Aging.</p>

          <p>The final series Miscellaneous [box 27] contains a variety of materials that came to the Bentley Historical Library after Donahue's death. This series overlaps in many ways the previously described materials, but also fills in gaps by providing some personal correspondence and a little information about Donahue's teaching activities in the 1960s and her research interests in the 1980s. This accession has been divided into six short subseries.</p>

            <p>Alumnus Place documents a failed proposal made by Donahue and her colleagues at the University of Michigan to build an education-oriented retirement community for University of Michigan alumni and faculty. Envisioned as a continuing education center for retirees, the plans for Alumnus Place never came to fruition.</p>

The third subseries, Correspondence, has been placed in chronological arrangement by year, with the exception that there is a separate folder for 1989 correspondence about the writing and publication of Memoirs in Aging, a history of gerontology in Michigan.</p>
