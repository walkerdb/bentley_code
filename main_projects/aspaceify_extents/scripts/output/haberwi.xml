    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>William Haber led a varied and active life as a teacher, author, economist, university administrator, consultant, arbitrator, government official, and active member of the American Jewish community. Born in Rumania on March 6, 1899, Haber was brought to the United States as a child of ten. He grew up in Milwaukee and received his college education primarily at the University of Wisconsin, although he also attended Harvard for two years of graduate training. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1923, masters in 1926, and doctorate in 1927, all from the University of Wisconsin and all in economics.</p>
      <p>Haber began his academic career as an instructor at the University of Wisconsin (1926-1927), then as an associate professor of economics at Michigan State College (1927-1936), and finally as a professor at the University of Michigan (1936-1988). Though he held many non-university positions since his arrival in Ann Arbor in 1936, Haber remained affiliated with the University of Michigan throughout. At Michigan he served in a series of educational administrative posts, including chairman of the economics department (1962-1963), dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (1963-1968) and special adviser to the university's executive officers (1968-1988).</p>
      <p>As an expert in the field of labor-management relations, Haber was frequently sought out by both sides to arbitrate disputes, or to serve on jointly appointed boards administering and evaluating pension funds and other similar matters. His intimate knowledge of labor and management grew out of his academic work. He was most interested in questions of employment, in particular insurance both for the unemployed and for those unable to work due to age or health.</p>
      <p>Haber's area of academic specialization also led him into governmental service, as a consultant and administrator. Among positions held by Haber were the directorship of the Michigan State Emergency Relief Administration (1934), consultant to the Social Security Board (1939-1945), chairman of the committee for long range work and relief policy of the National Resources Planning Board (1941-1944), and chairman of the Federal Advisory Council on Employment Security (1948-1988).</p>
      <p>Despite his numerous other activities, Haber's most time consuming interest was the state of world Jewry. During World War II and immediately thereafter, Haber served with the National Refugee Service, the American Jewish Committee, and on General Lucius Clay's staff as Advisor on Jewish Affairs to the Commander-in-chief U.S. Forces in Germany and Austria (1948-1949). Between 1949 and 1964, Haber served as chairman of the National Hillel Commission B'nai B'rith. His greatest interest, however, was in the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training (ORT). Although ORT's existence predates World War II, ORT's global operations (after the war) concentrated upon assisting survivors of the Holocaust. In 1950 Haber was elected President of the American ORT Federation, and between 1955 and 1975, he served as president of the World ORT Union's Central Board.</p>
      <p>The recipient of many awards and a prolific author, William Haber continued to teach economics courses at the university into his retirement. He died December 30, 1989.</p>

      <p>The papers of William Haber, covering the period since his education at the University of Wisconsin in the 1920s until his death in 1988, have come to the library in several accessions beginning in 1978. Because of the fullness of Haber's career and the fact that he worked out of different offices, this half century of documentation was surprisingly well organized although somewhat broken up because files had been retired at different times. In 1992, the collection was reprocessed and the opportunity was taken to bring together sequences of files that had been separated. There are still some inconsistencies in the filing but these have been explained and described in the Series Description that follows.</p>
      <p>The collection has been arranged into ten series. Although Haber and his secretarial staff never classified his files in these terms, the series headings were given to draw like materials together and to provide a rational framework for thinking about and using the various Haber files. The series are: Biographical/Personal; Correspondence; Jewish Organizations; University of Michigan; Other Organizational Activities; Appearances; Writings; Scrapbooks, clippings, etc.; Miscellaneous; and University of Wisconsin Files.</p>

          <p>Biographical/Personal (0.3 linear feet) is an artificially created series of biographical and bibliographical materials, including some photographs and articles written about Haber's life and career. Included is a diary which Haber kept for only a few days in 1926, some of Haber's educational records, mementos of the Habers' golden wedding anniversary, some of Fannie Haber's writings, and a folder of information on the Milwaukee Newsboys' Republic (with which Haber was involved as a youth). There is a separate series of clippings and press releases elsewhere in the collection documenting the day-to-day activities of Haber.</p>

          <p>Correspondence, 1918-1986 (21.5 linear feet), the largest series in the collection, is divided into chronological and alphabetical subseries. The one chronological subseries covers the period of 1923-1981 and consists of letters, loose and unfiled, that might at one time have belonged to an alphabetical sequence. This is followed by six alphabetical subseries each covering a period of years. These subseries are arranged alphabetically either by personal or organizational name. In many cases a rigorous distinction was not made between a person and an organization with which that person was intimately connected, so that the researcher should consult the alphabetical file under both entries. In terms of content, although there is some routine correspondence, these subseries do illustrate Haber's deep and life-long devotion to Judaism and his professional interests as an economist. On Haber's participation in Jewish organizations especially, the researcher is cautioned that an inspection of this series as well as the JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS series will be required.</p>

          <p>The Jewish Organizations (1941-1988; 10.5 linear feet) series consists of subseries of records maintained by Haber and documenting his extensive involvement in Jewish social action groups and educational institutions. Of special note are those files created while serving as Advisor on Jewish Affairs to the Commander-in-chief U.S. Forces in Germany and Austria (1948-1949). Included are various reports and memoranda, some correspondence, and notes he made relating to the issue of Palestine as a homeland for the Jews.</p>
          <p>The largest subseries in this series relate to his forty year relationship and activity with ORT (the Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training). Haber was a trusted advisor and a faithful correspondent with the leaders of this organization (of which he was one himself). His files are filled with communications about both the American ORT Federation and the World ORT Union. Although Haber was based in Ann Arbor, his files contain communications from throughout the world about the work of ORT and the condition of world Jewry. Of nearly the same bulk are the records from his activities with the Hillel Foundation of B'nai B'rith. As a respected educator, Haber was frequently asked to serve on various boards of educational institutions. Among these, Haber devoted most of this time to Hebrew University and Brandeis University. Smaller subseries in JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS include the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, the Jewish Agency for Israel, and the Fund for Higher Education. For the researcher interested in any of these organizations, care should be taken to examine the CORRESPONDENCE series for the names of individuals closely associated with any given organization.</p>

          <p>Other Organizational Activities brings together the miscellanea of Haber's other career and civic interests. Here have been placed the files documenting Haber's work as administrator of the Michigan State Emergency Welfare Relief Administration. These files cover the period of 1933 to 1936. There are also files relating to his work with the National Resources Planning Board, 1940-1941. Of greater bulk (but still unprocessed) are the records of his service with the U.S. Bureau of Employment Security and the research undertaken with the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.</p>

          <p>The Appearances (1926-1984; 3.5 linear feet) series consists of the speeches and scholarly papers given by Haber over his long career. In addition, there are several folders of programs and announcements for William Haber speeches and appearances. Some of the materials in this series have been left in their original order within their folders; there is a great deal of overlap (for both organizations and dates) among the chronological folders, and they cover the years 1947-1974. There are also folders for individual organizations and appearances.</p>
