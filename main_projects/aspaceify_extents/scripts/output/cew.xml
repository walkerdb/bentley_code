      <p>Designed to serve the needs of women students as well as women returning to school or work, CEW (then known as the Center for the Continuing Education of Women) was founded with a three part mission of service, advocacy, and research. CEW maintains that mission today, serving University students, staff and faculty, community members, women and men, facing educational, employment or other life issues.</p>
      <p>Over the years, CEW has served as a model for other centers, has worked on behalf of women on this campus, in the state of Michigan, and nationally, and has conducted research informing us about women's lives - their work, their education, their family demands, and their aspirations.1</p>
      <p>In August 1962, Louise Gilbert Cain prepared "A Memo and Suggestion on the Continuing Education of Women." Mrs. Cain, who worked in the University Extension Service, had become increasing aware of the problems faced by women students when they attempted to re-enter the university. The university responded to Louise Cain's memo by appointing her Special Assistant to Roger W. Heynes, the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Mrs. Cain prepared "Recommendations for a Center for the Continuing Education of Women" in June 1963. An advisory committee of deans was constituted and by May of the following year a proposal for a center had been written.</p>
      <p>The Center for the Continuing Education of Women (CEW) began operations on September 1, 1964. It was initially funded by a $15,000 appropriation from President Harlan Hatcher. The second year's operating budget was doubled with the addition of funds from the Alumnae Council.</p>
      <p>Louise Cain was appointed director (on leave) of CEW for 1964/65; Jean Campbell was acting director and Helen Hornbeck Tanner was assistant director. Jean Campbell became director in September 1965 and continued in that position until 1985. Subsequent directors have been: Vivian Rogers, 1985-1987; Patricia Wulp, acting director, 1987-1988; and Carol S. Hollenshead, 1988 to the present. After Helen Hornbeck Tanner left CEW in 1967, the Assistant Director position was upgraded to that of Associate Director. CEW Associate Directors have been Patricia Wulp, 1968-1994, and Susan Kaufmann, 1994 to the present.</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1960s the center expanded its services to women. The center began publication of a newsletter in the Fall of 1968 and the first conference/workshop "Women in Action" was held in 1969. CEW also began the publication of a paperback series related to women and continuing education.</p>
      <p>The center, which reports to the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, provides educational and vocational guidance to women whose education has been interrupted. The information collected on each counselee or "participant" is coded and the data is used to provide demographic, educational and work experience information on the participant. The data is also used to design CEW programs, to evaluate the center's performance, and to contribute to the basic knowledge about women in today's society. The center organizes discussions, workshops and conferences focusing on women's experiences in higher education and on women's experiences in general. The center's library, a collection of vocational materials and pamphlets of interest to women, provides an additional resource. The center's scholarship program, begun in 1970, the centennial year of women at the University of Michigan, awards merit scholarships. The center also gives emergency grants.</p>
      <p>Since its inception the center has become the focus of activities by and for women at the university, lending its support and expertise to the affirmative action movement, the Commission for Women, the development of the Women's Studies Program, and WISE, Women in Science and Engineering. The center's staff has served on university and community committees concerned with women's issues and has brought the perspective of women's needs to university committees. Staff members have worked for changes in university rules and procedures, scheduling and curricula through their membership on such committees as the LS&amp;A Admissions Committee, the Commission on Graduate Requirements, the International Women's Year University of Michigan Committee, the LS&amp;A Commission on Graduation Requirements, and the Committee on the Status of Women in Graduate Education.</p>
      <p>The center has also developed programs to benefit special groups of women such as the Arrow Program for undergraduate women, the Evening Program courses (originally designed for student wives), and various programs for international women. In addition, several task forces, such as the Compensation Program and Dependent Care Task Forces, have been developed over the years to address varying needs in the community. More detailed information about the center's history and it's current events and programs can be found on its website at http://www.umich.edu/~cew.</p>
      <p>Note to the researcher: The name of the center was changed in 1989 from the Center for the Continuing Education of Women to the Center for the Education of Women.</p>

      <p>The Center for Education of Women collection consist of minutes, correspondence, audiovisual materials, and other records documenting the founding, public programs, research projects, day-to-day administrative activities, and individual staff members of the University of Michigan's Center for the Education of Women. It is divided into four broad subgroups: Central Office Files, 1961-1998; Individual Staff Files, 1919-1999; Audiovisual Materials, 1963-1997; and Restricted Files, 1964-1995. The current CEW collection is the result of a major reprocessing project that combined several new accessions with the pre-existing record group--itself the accumulation of several accessions--and which has resulted in a re-figured collection nearly double the size of the original. The first three subgroups and their major series have been retained, but some of the lower-level organization has been updated to reflect the fuller picture of the Center that the combined set of materials affords.</p>
      <p>Documents within folders may be arranged either chronologically or reverse chronologically, based on the existing arrangement of the majority of materials (in both the pre-existing collection and in the new accessions). Also, some files (e.g. most correspondence) were filed by calendar year (Jan-Dec.), while others (notably budgets, staff meetings, and program files) were filed by fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, files arranged by academic year (indicated in the box list by dates such as '1990/91') run from July of the first year through June of the second year.</p>
      <p>Researchers examining the CEW collection may also be interested in related files in the following other Bentley University of Michigan record groups: Institute on Gerontology, Michigan Initiative on Women's Health, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.</p>
      <p>Additionally, researchers should note the following overlaps between the 'Topical' series in the 'Central Office Files' subgroup and the files of CEW staff members in the 'Individual Staff Files' subgroup:</p>
      <list type="simple">
        <item>Counseling: Myra Fabian, Dorothy McGuigan, Vivian Rogers, and Patricia Wulp</item>
        <item>Evening Program (especially 1982 and later): Patricia Wulp</item>
        <item>Group Counseling and Workshops (e.g. Career Decision Making, Assertiveness, the Step Before the Job Search, etc.): Myra Fabian, Barbara Anton, and Patricia Wulp</item>

          <p>The Central Office Files, 1961-1998 (18.5 linear feet) subgroup contains two series, Core Administration, 1961-1994 and Topical Files, 1962-1998.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Core Administrative Records, particularly the Staff Meeting, Correspondence, and Review files, are quite valuable in documenting the day-to-day activities of the center and its major programs. In addition, the series includes records regarding the center's creation (including Louise Cain's original proposals and the Alumnae Council's early involvement in the center), annual and long-term reports, CEW descriptions and organizational charts, planning and budget materials, thank-you letters from former participants, and Executive Committee records.</p>
            <p>The researcher should note that the Correspondence sub-series and its components--Directors Correspondence, Staff Correspondence, and Intra-University Correspondence--should not be viewed as complete runs of all incoming or outgoing correspondence. Also, it contains major overlaps both between those three components, with the Topical Files, and with individual staff members' files. This sub-series is largely based on the organization of the pre-existing collection, and does not necessarily reflect how the files came from CEW. Correspondence in the newer accessions were generally kept with either individual staff members' files or with the Topical files. The Intra-University Correspondence is only loosely based on the UM office or unit in question; in some cases it is more topically arranged. (E.g. 'Affirmative Action' contains not only correspondence from the Affirmative Action Program, but also correspondence relating to affirmative action from the President's Office and the VP for Academic Affairs.) Titles of purely topical files of Intra-University Correspondence (with no basis in the university office/administrative unit structure) are enclosed in quote marks ("").</p>
            <p>Similarly, the researcher should be aware that the Staff Meetings and Notes sub-series was compiled from several different staff-members overlapping, partial runs of minutes and notes. Duplicates that had annotations were generally retained. Of special note within the sub-series are the two binders: The first, the 'Staff Calendar and Events' binder includes not only agendas, notes, and calendars (like the regular staff meeting files), but also flyers for CEW events. The second is 'Patricia Wulp's Staff Meetings and Notes binder'. This file, along with the 'Administration Binder' in Wulp's individual staff files, appears to have been started in 1973, while Wulp was serving as Acting Director during a sabbatical of Jean Campbell's. They include staff minutes agendas, calendars, and minutes, as well as Wulp's notes on CEW administration, program planning materials, and correspondence with Jean Campbell and others.</p>
            <p>Finally, many of the materials relating to CEW's budget have been removed from the Core Administrative series and restricted. Other places to find budgetary information include the Planning sub-series (especially for 1985-1987), the Staff Meetings and Notes, and the Correspondence files (especially with the President's office and the Vice President for Academic Affairs). Additionally, records documenting the center's founding and start-up funds, as well as some of its early fundraising efforts can be found in the Alumnae Council section of the Founding and Historical Documents sub-series, and budget information for various CEW programs can be found in the Topical and Individual Staff files under "Programs" and under the names of specific events.</p>

          </did>
          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Topical files are arranged alphabetically and contain material about specific conferences and events sponsored by the center, the research it has conducted, its liaisons with and involvement in other groups working on similar portfolios, and its day-to-day activities. In the original collection, the topical files of each accession were formed around director Jean Campbell's topical files, with the additions of similar topical files from associate director Pat Wulp and office files that were the work of several staff members. These earlier runs of topical files--all of which covered essentially the same date range--have been combined into a single series, into which similar material from the newer accessions have been added.</p>
            <p>Highlights of the series include records on several major CEW initiatives, including the Evening Program, the Women in Science Program, the center's Scholarship Awards, various programs for international women, its research activities, its many conferences and workshops, and its involvement in university-wide efforts to document and improve the climate for women and minority students, faculty and staff. Also included in the series are a large quantity of public relations material and a small body of photographs that were filed as a group. The locations of other photographs, that have been left with their related topical documents, are indicated by the note '(includes photo)' in the folder listing.</p>
            <p>The researcher should note that (in addition to the overlaps between the Topical Files and other series, mentioned in the collection-wide scope and content note) there are a number of overlapping subjects within the Topical series:</p>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>'Black Women In Transition' and 'Perspectives on Black Women'</item>
              <item>'Centennial 1970' and 'Women on Campus'</item>
              <item>'Employment', 'Job', and 'Michigan Civil Service Commission'</item>
            </list>
            <p>Additionally, there are two related clusters of files dealing with statistics and quantitative data on the climate for women and minorities at the University of Michigan in general and on CEW participants in particular:</p>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>[The climate for women and minorities]: 'Affirmative Action', 'Central Coordinating Committee for Women and Minority Services', 'Statistics on UM Enrollment of Women', and files starting with 'Women and Minority...'</item>
              <item>[CEW participants and other non-traditional students]: CEW research program, 'Grants-Ford Foundation', 'Non-traditional/Older Students Study', 'Participant Data', 'Report on UM Women', and 'Research Program'</item>
            </list>
            <p>Finally, researchers looking for records of CEW's programs and events should look under individual program names, in the 'Programs by Academic Year' files, and in the 'Publicity' files.</p>

          <p>The Individual Staff Files include the files of Barbara Anton, Ruth Bordin, Louise Gilbert Cain, Jean Campbell, Myra Fabian, Carol Hollenshead, Sue Kaufmann, Jean Manis, Hazel Markus, Dorothy McGuigan, Vivian Rogers, and Patricia Wulp. In addition to their commitment to advocacy for women through their positions and duties at CEW, center staff members have been deeply involved in their own professional fields. As such, the individual staff members' files contain a spectrum of materials ranging from official CEW business to quite personal material. For example, the files document individuals' duties at CEW (e.g. Myra Fabian's counseling files); university duties following from CEW work (e.g. Myra Fabian's WING files); non-CEW-related university work (e.g. Carol Hollenshead's files relating to her position at the Office for the Vice President of Research); professional papers (e.g. Myra Fabian's NAWDAC files); and personal papers (e.g. Vivian Rogers' Lumpectomy Support Group file). Some sets of papers fall into more than one category, for example Sue Kaufmann's Sexual Harassment Policies files, which document activities she began while at other University of Michigan units and continued once she came to CEW.</p>

            <p>As director during the center's first twenty years, 1965-1985, Jean Campbell was involved in all aspects of CEW's activities. As a result of Campbell's central position, the bulk of her files from the early CEW accessions formed the core of the 'Topical Files' series. As more of her materials have been accessioned, an individual series was created for her that includes more personal, less central materials (such as her correspondence, speeches, and talks) and materials from the new accessions.</p>

            <p>The files of Myra Fabian &gt;(counselor, circa 1968-1988) are divided into records of her oversight of CEW's counseling function, her involvement with the leadership of the National Association of Women Deans, Administrators, and Counselors and its Michigan chapter, and miscellaneous topical files. The counseling files document the philosophy and implementation of developmental (as opposed to psychiatric) counseling at CEW. Fabian's topical files consist largely of her speaking engagements, which often took the form of either talks on CEW and its service, advocacy, and research functions or of workshops similar to CEW's group counseling workshops.</p>

            <p>Carol Hollenshead's files &gt;(Director, 1988-present) include detailed records of the planning and execution of the CURIES conference on Women in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering (sponsored by grants from the Sloan Foundation), including the follow-up publications and policy recommendations that came out of the conference. Another major subseries within Hollenshead's papers documents her research at the Institute of Gerontology on older women and work. The bulk of these files consists of drafts and revisions of Hollenshead's research papers. Other highlights include files from Hollenshead's role on the executive committee for the Michigan Initiative on Women's Health and the 1994 CEW faculty survey.</p>

            <p>Jean Manis' papers, ca. 1975-1995, document her oversight of various CEW research projects. The largest set pertains to the Ford Foundation grants to research the relationships between women, their work and educational status, and their quality of life. Another significant set of Manis' files pertains to studies she conducted in the 1990s on the climate for women students at the university, specifically "Project on the Graduate Experience" and "Women in the Engineering Pipeline".</p>

            <p>The highlight of Hazel Markus' files &gt;(Researcher, circa 1970-1980) are the records of the 1970s CEW participant studies she conducted and supervised. These studies were the precursors to and models for the research studies that CEW undertook as part of the grants it received from the Ford Foundation. While not as in-depth as Jean Manis' Ford project files, many aspects of the earlier work are documented in Markus' files, including several years' codebooks for both the CEW participant intake forms and the CEW questionnaires, original, completed surveys filled out by participants, and data analysis.</p>

            <p>The files of associate director Patricia Wulp, 1968-1994, include extensive information about the programs sponsored by CEW, including the continuations of the chronological sets of 'Evening Program' and 'Programs' files (the beginning of which are located in the Topical Files). A study of these files reveals many of the ways in which CEW has and continues to support women and education over Wulp's tenure of nearly thirty years. Many files include detailed planning information and notes kept by Wulp throughout the planning process.</p>

          <p>The Audio-Visual Material series consists of many CEW awards programs, lectures, and information material. The video materials include two video reel-to-reel trigger tapes, "The Perils of Paula" and the "Street Corner Society", meant to spark group discussions and a videotape (U-matic format) of the Center's "Two Women, Twenty Years," which details the life stories of two non-traditional students who were involved with CEW when they received their education at the University of Michigan. Other highlights include several VHS recordings of CEW Scholarship Awards programs, the Elizabeth Mullin-Welch lecture series, videos on the Women of Color in the Academy Project, an informational video describing the programs and services at CEW, and an informational video about the CEW sponsored Science for Life program. The audio materials are stronger for the 1970s, including several talks from the 1975-1976 Brownbag series (aka Research Reports from Returning Women), as well as several discussion groups, conferences, and symposia. There are also audio recordings of various CEW programs from the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
