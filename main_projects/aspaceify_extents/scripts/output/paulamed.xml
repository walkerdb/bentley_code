      <p>St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, "the church of the friendly welcome," in Detroit, Michigan, was founded by Bishop George L. Blackwell in 1911. St. Paul's growth and strength depended on two factors: securing buildings in which the faithful could worship and the inspiring leadership of dynamic pastors. Over the course of time, the congregation of St Paul has met in various venues ranging from the original church on Catherine Street, to the old Vaudette Theatre on Gratiot, to a new church on Catherine, to a facility at Palmer and Beaubien, to the present building at Dexter and Lawrence. Throughout its history St. Paul has benefited from the careful guidance of its pastors, men sensitive to the spiritual needs of the congregation and to the economic difficulties of maintaining a church.</p>
      <p>The first pastor of St. Paul A. M. E. Zion was Rev. James A. Terry who handled the challenge resulting from the burning down of the original Catherine Street building in 1916. Terry left the congregation in the competent hands of Rev. L. Thomas Conquest in 1918. For a time Conquest presided over services in the Vaudette Theatre, until the congregation was able to purchase a new church on Catherine. The dynamic Rev. P. R. Flack took the reins as pastor in 1922 and shepherded the congregation through the difficult times of the depression. Despite economic hardships, Flack was able to transplant the church to the west side facility at Palmer and Beaubien. Rev. Lott P. Powell returned to St. Paul in 1941 to serve as pastor. Powell developed organizational structures within the church which endure to the present. He served with distinction until his passing in 1946.</p>
      <p>In 1947 the Rev. William A. Hilliard became pastor. He was well suited to the task, building the membership to a number which outgrew the Palmer and Beaubien edifice. This precipitated the moving of the church to its present location at Dexter and Lawrence. In the course of the move, the congregation divided into two Zion Churches. The group which stayed behind is known as the Metropolitan Church and was led by Rev. Stephen P. Spotswood. Hilliard fulfilled his pastoral tasks so well that he was elevated to the position of Bishop in the A. M. E. Zion Church in 1960.</p>
      <p>In June 1960 Dr. William C. Ardrey became the pastor of St. Paul and ably led the sixth largest congregation in Detroit. Ardrey stepped up the level of community involvement begun by Hilliard, opening the doors of St. Paul for local groups' meetings and personally taking action to improve the neighborhood and city. Ardrey's involvement in the local NAACP, service on the Detroit Public Library board, and mediation in the 1983 teachers' strike evidence his social commitment. The acme of his activism, securing federal funds for a housing project for the elderly and low income families, was cast into shadow as the loans came due before the building could be occupied. Rev. William M. White succeeded Ardrey in 1989.</p>

          <p>The Administrative series covers the period 1957-2002 and is the largest portion of the record group. In addition to the church's quarterly conference minutes, this series also documents its activities within the Michigan Conference and within the General or national conference. Under "Financial" are formal, detailed, annual and quarterly reports containing information about nearly all of the church's expenditures and receipts. It should be noted that financial information about the status of various church projects can be found scattered throughout this series. Under "Pastors," the researcher will find information about pastors Hilliard and Ardrey. Although most of these files relate to the activities of Pastor Ardrey, files of Bishop Hilliard have been separately donated to the library and may be found cataloged under his name. The Ardrey files reflect his concern for his community and his desire to improve the educational system. Materials from many of the committees that he worked on - including the Property Release Option program, Citizens for Millage, and the Task Force on School/Community Relations - are found in this portion of the Administrative series.</p>
          <p>St. Paul A.M.E. Zion Church was also involved in a housing project, 1966-1978, and records from this undertaking are found under the heading "St. Paul Housing Corporation." Designed to be an affordable housing alternative for the elderly and low income families, this project was financed by a federal government loan. Unfortunately, the project never materialized as anticipated because the loan came due before construction was completed.</p>
          <p>The Administration series also includes materials on some of the organizations within the church, such as its clubs, the board of stewards and the board of trustees. The researcher will get a sense of the church's membership by examining the funeral notices, many of which contain brief summaries of the lives of deceased members. This subseries is arranged alphabetically by name of member. There are also funeral notices scattered among the most recent Sunday Bulletins.</p>
