    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Robert Ball, born June 18, 1926 in Owosso, Michigan, enjoyed a long and productive career as European correspondent for Time and Fortune magazines from 1954 to 1985. Ball's education included two stints at the University of Michigan interrupted by a tour of duty with the United States Navy during World War II. Ball left the English Ph.D. program in 1949 to pursue his interest in journalism. He traveled around Europe in 1950 and supported himself by selling a series of articles on the European common man to Michigan newspapers. Ball next worked as press officer for the United States High Command for Germany; he held this position until he caught on as a stringer for Time in September 1954.</p>
      <p>Ball's career at Time was a study in steady advancement in status and responsibility: Munich stringer, 1954; Bonn bureau staffer, 1957; London deputy bureau chief, 1962; European Economic Correspondent, 1975. He covered the uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956; the Berlin Crises, 1958-1961; the Profumo Affair of 1963; the European Common Market from 1962 to 1970; and the Czechoslovakia revolt in 1968. Given the economic bent of Ball's beat, it was not surprising that Fortune hired him as European editor and correspondent. He covered business, industry, and enterprise for Fortune magazine until his retirement in June 1985. Upon his retirement, Ball organized his papers in preparation for writing a book on his journalistic experiences.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Robert Ball papers are roughly divided into two subgroups according to the focus of material, personal or professional. Within this framework, the personal papers are arranged in series by type then by chronological order. The professional papers are arrayed in strict chronological order regardless of type, except for the cassette tapes which stand as a distinct series. Ball's organization of the materials in binders both necessitated and facilitated strict adherence to chronology in ordering the professional papers. The researcher should note that the division of materials into personal and professional groups can not be absolute given the dual nature of reportorial writing. Such writing is both personal and professional. Some blurring of the categories is evident, especially for the years 1948 to 1951 when Ball's nascent career did not permit rigid distinctions to be drawn in the materials.</p>

            <p>The bulk of the Personal Papers series is comprised of Correspondence (0.75 linear feet, 1936-1974). Most of the correspondence is addressed to Ball's father and mother although there are business letters interspersed in the years 1948 to 1954. Topics of the letters include student life at the University of Michigan during the 1940s, his war-time experiences as a naval officer in the Pacific theater, and his life as an American in Europe from the late-1940s to the mid-1970s. His mother evidently transcribed Ball's overseas missives to forward to Adele Ball. The transcripts were only retained if Ball's original letter was missing. The correspondence is arranged chronologically</p>

            <p>Education (0.5 linear feet, 1933-1949) centers on his years as a student and is comprised mainly of his writings. The series documents his early writing style and world-view, especially in the papers from Owosso High School and the University of Michigan essays. Also included are drafts from a historical novel that he never finished, "The Cock and the Cross," about the plague and the Swiss Reformation.</p>

            <p>The majority of the collection is in the Time and Fortune Magazine Correspondent section (12 linear feet, 1954-1998). It includes a set of cassette tapes of interviews conducted by Ball for <title render="italic">Fortune</title> Magazine, mainly with executives of European automobile companies, dispatches for <title render="italic">Time</title> and <title render="italic">Fortune</title>, and a brief record of his expenses.</p>
            <p>The dispatches for <title render="italic">Time</title> and <title render="italic">Fortune</title> are arranged chronologically, in the binders as they were stored by Ball. The subject headings were created by him as well. The bulk of the materials consists of on-the-spot reports cabled to <title render="italic">Time</title> or <title render="italic">Fortune</title> and drafts of articles for the magazine. Also included is correspondence with editors and sources and records of his expenses. The articles for <title render="italic">Time</title> include both political and economic topics, while the articles for <title render="italic">Fortune</title> are predominantly economic.</p>
