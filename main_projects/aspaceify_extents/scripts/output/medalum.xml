      <p>The Office of Medical Development and Alumni Relations is responsible for fundraising and interaction with alumni for the University of Michigan Medical Center, including the University of Michigan Hospitals and Medical School. Over the years, the office has sponsored a variety of fundraising and programming events that are documented within these records. The New Horizons in Medicine program (1992 to 1995) was a series of special programs developed to bring major and prospective donors to campus to learn about medical research, education, and patient care, as well as to cultivate them as donors for the MomentUM capital campaign. The Vital Signs program (1987) was a series of one-day seminars designed to inform and broaden the interest of potential donors and friends of the Medical Center. The Luncheon Program (1991 to 1993) was designed to bring together prospective donors, business leaders and other individuals from the local community to meet with the Executive Director of the University of Michigan Hospitals, and the Vice Provost for Medical Affairs.</p>
      <p>The Medical Center Alumni Society (MCAS) was founded in 1960, as an affiliate of the Alumni Association of the University of Michigan, as one of the first alumni societies at Michigan whose membership consisted of graduates of a particular school or college. Staffing for the MCAS organization and activities is currently provided by the Office of Medical Development and Alumni Relations, but has in the past been assigned to other administrative units, including the Alumni Association and the Office of Postgraduate Medicine (Department of Medical Education.)</p>
      <p>MCAS membership is open to graduates of the Medical School and its related residency, fellowship, and doctoral programs, past and present Medical School faculty members, as well as those who have demonstrated an interest in the Medical Center. Membership included the School of Nursing alumni and faculty members until the School of Nursing officially withdrew from MCAS as of January 1, 1993. MCAS membership is granted automatically; no membership dues are assessed.</p>
      <p>The Board of Governors is the governing arm of MCAS. Sixteen members of the board are chosen by election, serving three-year terms (ten members are graduates of the Medical School, and the remaining six may be graduates of the Medical School, graduate training programs, or past and present faculty members). A number of ex officio members represent university administrative units. Meeting semi-annually, the Board of Governors is organized into committees, where the work of the organization is conducted. Current committees consist of the Executive, Awards and Nominating, Reunion and Alumni Programs, and Student-Alumni Relations Committees. Past committees have included Development-Outreach, Reunion-Departmental Relations, and Directory/Database committees.</p>
      <p>A Visiting Committee reported to the Board of Governors from 1974 to around the time of a constitutional change in the early 1990s. The Visiting Committee consisted of a group of 16 appointed members (both alumni and national health care leaders) that met annually to make strategic planning and operational recommendations to administrators of the Medical Center.</p>
      <p>MCAS sponsors a number of activities, including the annual MCAS reunion each fall, an awards program honoring distinguished alumni, scholarships for deserving students in the health professions, and outreach activities for alumni and students. MCAS activities are funded from gifts as well as budget appropriation from the University of Michigan Alumni Association.</p>

          <p>The Medical Center Alumni Society (MCAS) Files series, 1960-2001, (3.75 linear feet), is an alphabetically arranged series containing materials related to MCAS. The files include minutes, programs, membership rosters, and correspondence from the semi-annual meetings of the Board of Governors as well as the annual meetings of the Visiting Committee, providing an in-depth look at the operation of the organization and changes in its structure and focus. Also included in the Board of Governors annual meeting files are reports from a number of campus leaders, including the Dean of the Medical School, the Executive Director of the University Hospitals, the Vice Provost For Medical Affairs, and through the early 1990s, the Dean of the School of Nursing. These reports serve well to identify important issues of the time.</p>
