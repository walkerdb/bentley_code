    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Jennifer Granholm was born February 5, 1959 in Vancouver, British Columbia to Shirley Alfreda Dowden and Victor Ivar Granholm. At the age of four, Granholm's family moved to California; she grew up in Anaheim, San Jose, and San Carlos. Granholm earned a B.A. in Political Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1984 and continued her education at Harvard Law School. After receiving her J.D. in 1987, Granholm moved to Michigan where she began her career as a law clerk for Judge Damon Keith of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1990 she became a U. S. Prosecutor in Detroit, and served as corporation counsel for Wayne County from 1994 to 1996 before becoming the general counsel for the Detroit and Wayne County Stadium Authority.</p>
      <p>Granholm entered statewide politics in 1998 when she ran for Attorney General on the Democratic ticket. She was the only Democrat elected to statewide office that year and served in the position through 2002. Towards the end of her term she had gained enough statewide recognition to enter the governor's race. Announcing her candidacy in March of 2001, she defeated both former governor James Blanchard and House Democratic Whip David Bonior to win the Democratic primary. In November of 2002, she won the general election, defeating Republican Lieutenant Governor Dick Posthumus to become Michigan's first female governor.</p>
      <p>Granholm took office as Michigan's 47th governor on January 1, 2003. The beginning of her tenure as governor coincided with a difficult period in Michigan's economic history. As the rest of the country recovered from the 2001 recession, Michigan continued to struggle. In her first year as governor, Granholm faced a $3 billion budget deficit and a rising unemployment rate. Her administration's response to the challenges it faced reflected Granholm's moderate approach by focusing on reinforcing education, promoting economic diversification, and improving government efficiency through cost cutting and streamlining.</p>
      <p>Despite challenges early in her first term, Granholm set about an extensive program of cuts to state expenditures in order to balance Michigan's budget. She continued to seek cost saving measures throughout her first term. Granholm also focused on education and, in 2004, established the Cherry Commission, headed by Lieutenant Governor John Cherry, to study ways to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. She also implemented rigorous K-8 standards through the State Board of Education, increased high school graduation requirements, and created the Early Childhood Investment Corporation.</p>
      <p>After two years in office, as Michigan's economy began to stall, Granholm pursued a multi-pronged effort to spur job creation and increase the state's flagging tax base. In 2005, Granholm kicked off her economic revitalization program with the 21st Century Jobs Fund, a $2 billion program that used tobacco settlement funds to encourage diversification in the state's economy. Granholm also launched the <emph render="italic">Pure Michigan</emph> advertising campaign to promote tourism and Michigan's leisure industry. The administration viewed Google's choice of Ann Arbor for its AdWords operation as a victory for its diversification efforts. In addition to pursuing economic diversification, Granholm created the Michigan Earned Income Tax Credit and signed bills that increased the minimum wage.</p>
      <p>With the continued downward spiral of Michigan's economy, including the loss of Greenville, Michigan's Electrolux plant to Juarez, Mexico in 2004, Granholm faced a tough re-election bid in 2006. Despite a concerted challenge from Republican Dick DeVos, a concerted campaign effort from early September through Election Day led to Granholm's eventual re-election.</p>
      <p>Granholm's second term focused primarily on Michigan's economy. She launched the term with No Worker Left Behind, a program designed to give unemployed and under-employed workers the opportunity to receive training for high-demand jobs. The governor's other efforts at job creation included emphasizing the clean and renewable energy industry and incentives for the production of auto batteries. In April, 2008, Granholm announced a set of film incentives. The incentive package was designed to both create jobs immediately and spur long-term growth. After the financial crisis of 2008, Granholm redoubled her efforts on behalf of Michigan's economy, speaking out on behalf of the state's beleaguered auto industry during the federal bailout and pursuing increased efforts at diversification. In addition to her work on behalf of Michigan's economy, Granholm also signed the Promise Zone legislation in 2008 to give students in high-poverty communities the opportunity to attend college, presided over the hearing regarding the removal of Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, and reorganized and shut down several state departments in the interest of increased efficiency and budgetary restraint.</p>
      <p>Granholm is currently Distinguished Practitioner of Law and Public Policy at her alma mater, the University of California at Berkeley, serves on the Board of Trustees of the Dow Chemical Corporation, and is a Senior Advisor to the Pew Charitable Trusts' Clean Energy Program. She married Daniel Mulhern in 1986 and they have three children.</p>

      <p>The Jennifer Granholm collection consists of paper records, analog audio-visual material (photographs, audio and video recordings), and digital files (word processing documents, spreadsheets, .PDF files, image files, digital audio and video files, and archived web pages). The digital files were received on hard drives, DVDs and other media, and through website capture. All digital files have been transferred to the University of Michigan servers and in some cases reformatted according to accepted preservation standards. The original file structure has been maintained to the extent possible and is reflected in the arrangement of the contents list. For storage and management purposes the digital files have bundled into compressed ZIP files. Typically the ZIP file will include multiple files or one or more folders, each containing individual files or nested sub-folders. The "download ZIP file" links in the contents list will download a ZIP file that includes all of the subordinate items in the contents list hierarchy. Contents of the ZIP file must be un-zipped before they can be viewed.</p>
      <p>In utilizing the collection, researchers should be aware of the following details. First, there is often an overlap in the subject matter of paper and (where extant) digital files of a given series. Researchers should therefore be sure to check both formats. Secondly, the collection contains very few physical photographs as the majority of the images taken of Governor Granholm and her administration were digital. These images are usually located in the "General Office Records" subseries (but may reside elsewhere) of the following series: Communications, Economic Recovery Office, Northern Michigan Office, the Legislative Affairs subseries of Other Executive Divisions, Office of the Lieutenant Governor, and Office of the First Gentleman.</p>

      <p>The Jennifer Granholm papers document the activities, policies, and accomplishments of the executive branch of Michigan's state government from 2003 to 2010. The collection consists of twelve series and is primarily arranged according to office of origin. The series are: Transition 2002, Legal Division, Policy Division, Executive Office, Communications Division, Economic Recovery Office, Northern Michigan Office, Other Executive Divisions, Office of the Lieutenant Governor, Office of the First Gentleman, Archived Websites, and Memorabilia. While the collection documents the full range of Governor Granholm's activities, it is especially strong in documenting the governor's efforts in the areas of economic diversification, renewable energy, education, and Michigan's response to the 2008 financial crisis. Also of note are the documents pertaining to the Governor's Hearing on the Removal of Kwame Kilpatrick from the office of Mayor of Detroit, the Legal Division files on the state's interactions with Michigan's Native American tribes, the administration's work on behalf of the University of Michigan in the Gratz and Grutter affirmative action lawsuits, the administration's response to Proposal 2, and dossiers kept on each Michigan soldier killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Transition 2002 documents the Granholm administration's transition to power following the 2002 gubernatorial election and is divided into two subseries: Director's Files (Lynn Johndahl) and Staff Files. Veteran Michigan lawmaker Lynn Johndahl served as the director of transition for the Granholm administration from November of 2002 through January of 2003. The Director's Files consist of the contents of binders related to the 2002 transition from the Engler administration to the Granholm administration. The Staff Files document the governor's inaugurations and plans regarding the staffing and organizational structure of the Office of the Governor. As a whole, this series provides a comprehensive yet succinct introduction to the Granholm administration's organizational structure.</p>

          <p>The Legal Division series is the largest of the twelve series in the collection and contains material on a wide range of issues. The mission of the Governor's Legal Division was primarily to provide sound legal advice and act as a liaison with the Attorney General. The files contain research materials, printed email correspondence, and legal documents. The series is comprised of eleven subseries organized by staff member and a General Office Records subseries organized by topic. The staff member subseries are: Kelly Keenan: Legal Counsel, 2003-2008; Steven C. Liedel: Deputy Legal Counsel (2003-2008) and Legal Counsel (2008-2010); Don Allen: Attorney General's Office and Deputy Legal Counsel; Suzanne Sonneborn: Deputy Legal Counsel; Victoria Manning: Paralegal; Danielle M. Brown: Staff; Corina Peña Andorfer: Deputy Legal Counsel; Michelle Rick: Deputy Legal Counsel; Brandon Hofmeister: Deputy Legal Counsel; Teresa Bingman: Deputy Legal Counsel; and John Wernet: Deputy Legal Counsel.</p>
          <p>Kelly Keenan served as the governor's legal counsel from 2003 to 2008. The Kelly Keenan: Legal Counsel, 2003-2008 subseries documents the full range of the Legal Division's activity. Keenan's files also document the Granholm administration's preparation of an amicus curiae brief in support of the University of Michigan in the Graetz and Grutter lawsuits and contain a significant collection of materials related to the Kwame Kilpatrick removal hearing. Steven C. Liedel, served as a Deputy Legal Counsel from 2003 to 2008 and was named Legal Counsel in 2008 upon the retirement of Kelly Keenan. His records primarily document transition and legislative issues. There is also some material related to the Kwame Kilpatrick removal hearing in the Liedel subseries. Additionally, the Liedel subseries contains files for each of Governor Granholm's executive orders, directives, and proclamations. Combined, the Keenan and Liedel subseries document the full range of the department's activity, although more detailed information on a particular topic can often be found in the files of a staffer who specialized in that area.</p>
          <p>The other nine staffers worked in more circumscribed areas including renewable energy, economic development, corrections, tribal issues, civil rights, and education. Of particular note are Deputy Legal Counsel Michelle Rick's files documenting the administration's response to Proposal 2 and John Wernet's extensive files on Tribal Issues. The final subseries, General Office Records , documents the same topics as the paper files, but is significantly more robust in documenting legislative activity.</p>

          <p>Regina Bell headed the administration's Policy Division, which advised the governor on a wide range of policy issues. The office also served as a liaison between the governor and cabinet members. Staffers worked in teams assigned to one or more policy areas corresponding to the major divisions of state government. The Policy Division series contains twelve subseries: Director's Files (Regina Bell); Transportation; Foundation Liaison Office; Housing, Urban, and Workforce Development; Public Health; Human Services; State Police, Corrections, and Energy; Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Environmental Quality; Education (Policy Advisors Niya Hardin, Sue Carnell, and Chuck Wilbur); Education (Chuck Wilbur); Benton Harbor; and General Office Records . The files primarily consist of research materials and printed email messages. The files in the General Office Records subseries are arranged both by staff member and by subject. They document the division's work in developing and overseeing Cabinet Action Plans and ensuring departments acted in accordance with the Granholm administration's official policy positions. The General Office Records subseries also documents Granholm's major policy accomplishments.</p>

          <p>The third series, Executive Division, is divided into four subseries: Executive Assistant's Files (Sherry Hicks), Special Advisor for Economic Development Files (Fred Hoffman), Dossiers of Michigan Service Members Lost in Iraq and Afghanistan, and General Office Records . Sherry Hicks served as Granholm's executive assistant and maintained her correspondence and subject files. Hicks arranged the correspondence chronologically into ingoing and outgoing folders and organized Granholm's subject files alphabetically. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Granholm brought in Fred Hoffman to advise her on economic issues. Hoffman's files document his research into various Michigan companies, the 2009 auto bailout, and the current state of the auto industry in Michigan. The General Office Records contain templates for Granholm's standard correspondence. Of particular interest is the Dossiers of Michigan Service Members Lost in Iraq and Afghanistan subseries (compiled by Linda Droste). Droste maintained files on each of the Michigan soldiers killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. These files include biographical information, documentation that the state would fly the flag at half mast, and confirmation that a staff member visited each soldier's family to deliver an American flag and offer condolences. Governor Granholm also called each family personally to offer her condolences.</p>

          <p>Governor Granholm established the Economic Recovery Office in 2009 to handle the administration and promotion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and to serve as a liaison to state departments. The Economic Recovery Office series documents the state's use of federal grant funding from ARRA and public relations efforts on behalf of ARRA programs. The series consists of three subseries: Administrative Staff (Jann Jencka, John Sorbet, Caron Fenning, and Beth Bingham); Communications Staff (Vicki Levengood and Elisabeth Hasbany); and General Office Records.</p>

            <p>The Administrative Staff files document programs supported by ARRA funding and were compiled by Beth Bingham (office director), Jann Jencka (education advisor) John Sorbet, and Caron Fenning. They also contain correspondence with the heads of state departments and agencies.</p>
