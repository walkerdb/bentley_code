    <bioghist>
      <p>One of America's most important and visionary landscape architects, Jens Jensen (1860-1951) held a deep-seated reverence for the beauty of the natural world, believing that time spent with nature is a necessity for the human soul. His "natural parks and gardens" were designed to offer opportunities for spiritual renewal, connections with the rhythms of nature, and an awareness of the unity of all things. He hoped, and it was part of his intent, that such experiences would both enrich people's lives and encourage them to appreciate and value remaining wild areas that were fast disappearing. Passionately integrating his work as artist, conservationist, ecologist, philosopher, and teacher, Jensen acquired an intimate knowledge of the Midwestern landscape in all its seasons.</p>
      <p>Born into a prosperous Danish family, Jensen chose to emigrate to the United States with his fiancee at age twenty-four rather than remain on the family's ancestral farm, working for short periods in Florida and Iowa before settling in Chicago. Initially hired as a street cleaner with the park service, he quickly worked his way up in the system. On weekends during these years, the family traveled by rail to the prairie countryside surrounding the city, and Jensen undertook what was to become a lifelong intense study of the plants and landscape of the region -- a study that would richly inform his art. In 1888, early in his career, Jensen planted an "American garden" in a corner of Union Park, utilizing familiar perennial wildflowers set against a background of native trees and shrubs. By 1895 he was named superintendent of Union Park, and by 1896 his responsibilities included Humboldt Park, one of the largest on the west side of the city. While the work Jensen loved the best and considered "the meaning of his life" were parks created for the general public, he refused to participate in the political graft that was rampant in Chicago municipal politics during the decade of the nineties and was dismissed in 1900.</p>
      <p>Jensen was active in progressive social and environmental reform movements that evolved in the city in the 1890s, such as Hull-House, the Committee on the Universe, and the Geographic Society of Chicago, where he developed friendships and made contacts that contributed to the development of a private practice after he lost his job. Working mainly on estates of the wealthy elite along Chicago's North Shore, he experimented with a variety of design ideas in the next few years, gradually solidifying many of the theories and methods that would become part of his unique and distinctive regional style (characterized by Wilhelm Miller in 1915 as the "prairie style" of landscape design, with its emphasis on conservation and restoration of native flora; the repetition of horizontal lines in land forms and stonework; and the natural branching habits of plants). As his design practice grew, Jensen established friendships with Chicago architects who were creating buildings in a prairie style -- organically influenced designs reflecting the broad, horizontal lines of the American Midwest. Notable for its representation of a mature approach is his design for the Harry Rubens estate in Glencoe, Illinois in 1902 (George W. Maher, architect), with its quiet and harmonious use of massed native plants; waterways, pools and cascades edged with stratified stonework reminiscent of Midwestern rivers and streams; broad open meadows and shady retreats; and meandering pathways. Trees with brilliant fall color were placed to catch the afterglow of the setting sun, and hawthorns and crabapples sited to add color to the forest border. Other important projects Jensen undertook with prairie school architects are the Henry Babson place in Riverside, Illinois, with Louis Sullivan; the I.B. Grommes place in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, with Richard Schmidt; Manitowoc High School in Wisconsin with Dwight Perkins; and the A.C. Magnus Place in Winnetka, Illinois with Robert Spencer. Jensen collaboration with Frank Lloyd Wright includes the Avery Coonley House in Riverside, Illinois, the Avery Coonley School and Kindergarten in Downers Grove, Illinois, the Sherman M. Booth place in Glencoe, Illinois, and the Abby Beecher Roberts place in Marquette, Michigan</p>
      <p>When Bernard A. Eckhart, a respected civic-minded businessman, was appointed chairman of the West Park Commission in 1905 as part of a reform movement, Jensen was rehired as superintendent and landscape architect. With a mandate from Eckhart and funding from the state legislature, he spent the next several years rehabilitating and improving seriously deteriorating West Parks. He drained an inefficient pond in Douglas Park and created a picturesque meadow, surrounding it with woodlands and adding a new boat landing, a music court and pavilions. In Garfield Park he constructed a dramatic conservatory reminiscent of Midwestern haystacks, filling it with representative prehistoric prairie plantings, incorporating water as a complete system -- spring, cascade, brook, and lake. At Humboldt Park he developed "prairie river gardens" resembling slow moving streams on the prairie. The tranquil water course was made up of several branches with cascades of stratified rock simulating bluffs and ravines, and riverbanks planted generously with native wetland plants. During this period, he also prepared designs for small playgrounds and recreation areas that were to be scattered throughout the West Chicago area.</p>
      <p>In 1916, Jensen designed Columbus Park, considered among his masterpieces, and the one which he regarded as most successful of his park designs. It was a project he relished and undertook from the heart -- in response, he once said, to the enchantment of the message of the prairies. The center was kept open to suggest the broad expanse of a prairie, horizontally branched hawthorns utilized to echo prairie views, and a linear lagoon edged and filled with masses of rushes, cat-tails, hibiscus, and water lilies. The rustic swimming pools, with their rock walls of natural horizontal limestone ledges planted with rock plants in the crevices, were designed to allow city children to experience native swimming holes. Instead of traditional playground equipment, areas were designed for creative and imaginative play in "wild" natural settings. For outdoor drama and pageants, Jensen set a "player's hill" on the rise between two brooks. Two of Jensen's trademark "council rings" were also part of the design. These low, circular, stone seats set around a fire pit, planned to be used for storytelling, conversation, music, or dance, were the only architectural element regularly incorporated into a Jensen design. Resembling Native American council fires and kivas of the Pueblos, the rings were also reminiscent of the camp fires of pioneers crossing the prairie, and were viewed by Jensen as a symbol of democracy, encouraging companionship with others and with nature.</p>
      <p>Between and during appointments with the park system, Jensen was a leading spokesperson for park reform and park planning. In his Special Park Commission work from 1899 to 1904 he helped survey potential parklands and natural areas for preservation, laying the groundwork for many park improvements and contributing to the establishment of the Cook County Forest Preserve District in 1913. In 1911, as chairman of the Chicago City Club's Committee on City Planning, he published an article entitled "Regulating City Building," in which he addressed planning issues, proposing collaboration among engineers, architects, businessmen, sculptors, and landscape architects to guide development and growth. Questioning an excessive commercial emphasis, Jensen proposed that the city emphasize its homelike qualities -- the American home as "centering the force of city planning." Jensen's Committee report, A Greater West Park System, although never implemented, illustrates theories he evolved on the role of open spaces in a city and the role of parks in urban design. Components include an integrated network of open spaces and "pleasure drives" connecting parklands, a canal connecting the Chicago and Des Plaines rivers for boating, several new parks, neighborhood kitchen gardens, neighborhood cultural centers on school sites, an agricultural college, an art school, and in-depth analysis of then available lands to fit into an overall system. The heart of the plan was his image of neighborhood cultural centers. Jensen believed schools "lacked soul," spaces and places designed to encourage creativity, and were underutilized for supporting lifelong learning. His design for the Lloyd School Center, for example, illustrates the way homes, businesses, commercial areas, and open spaces might be integrated into an urban setting, incorporating areas for senior citizens, gardens, swimming, playing fields and outdoor theater.</p>
      <p>Jensen retired from the park system soon after his West Park study was published in 1920, devoting more time to his design office and conservation. In 1909 he had changed his position with West Parks to Consulting Landscape Architect and in the intervening years his estate work grew dramatically. In 1910 he designed an estate for Sears and Roebuck founder Julius Rosenwald on the ravines of Highland Park overlooking Lake Michigan, developing a lasting relationship with the Rosenwald's that would spill over into support for conservation projects. In 1914, he began to work with Henry and Clara Ford on their Fair Lane estate in Dearborn, Michigan. While his relationship with the Ford's began amiably, it became marked with difficulties, ending when Mrs. Ford elected to make changes Jensen felt seriously interfered with the integrity of his design -- particularly the placing of a rose garden in the middle of one of his meadow spaces. The dam and rock work along the Rouge River at Fair Lane, however, remains today the best example of Jensen's masterly use of stratified limestone. Jensen continued to create projects for the Ford family and Ford Motor Company for about twenty years, designing the grounds of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, the sites of numerous Ford office buildings, portions of Greenfield Village, and four homes for Eleanor and Edsel Ford. Other notable private work includes the E.L. Ryerson Estate, Lake Forest, Illinois; the Frank W. Aldrich Place, Bloomington, Illinois; the Harley Clark Place, Evanston, Illinois; the Harold Florsheim Place, Highland Park, Illinois; the Wallace W. Gill Place, Glencoe, Illinois, and the Herbert Kurth Place, Mequon, Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>In this same period, Jensen undertook public design work beyond the Chicago parks. Significant projects include St. Ann's Hospital, Chicago, Illinois; the "ideal section" of the Lincoln Highway, Lake County, Indiana (a prototype for roadway plantings reflecting a prairie setting); a park system for Racine, Wisconsin; the Shakespeare Garden at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois; and the Lincoln Memorial Garden in Springfield, Illinois. Jensen was involved with the development of the Lincoln Garden from 1939 until his last illness a year before he died, integrating many of his trademark features with heightened attention to organic change, natural processes and succession in native ecosystems. It is one of few remaining designs that is still used the way he envisioned it, and is said to best represent his mature thinking and approach to landscape architecture.</p>
      <p>Jensen's long and active participation in numerous Chicago organizations had expanded over the years to include the City Club, the Cliff Dwellers, Municipal Science Club, Municipal Art League, Chicago Playground Association, Chicago Art Institute, and the Chicago Architects Club. These associations provided him not only intellectual stimulation, friendships, and a network for potential clients, but also an opportunity to acquaint himself with others who shared his strong interest in conservation. The two groups he formed, the Prairie Club and Friends of Our Native Landscape, were networks of botanists, writers, politicians, artists, social workers, philanthropists, and others with whom he devoted a great deal of time championing environmental causes. Both organizations, for example, spent years fighting for protection of the Indiana Dunes, finally achieved in 1926 when Indiana set aside 2,250 acres as Indiana Dunes State Park. The Friends, with its emphasis on Illinois state acquisition of wild and scenic areas (rather than the traditional historic), played an important role in establishing the present system of state parks in Illinois and significantly influenced public policy in Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>In 1935, after the death of his wife, Jensen left Chicago to devote more time to writing and speaking on conservation causes and to live in closer contact with nature, building a school and home on a remote northern tip of Wisconsin Door Country. Jensen based the curriculum of the school he called The Clearing on his experiences in Danish folk schools and agricultural schools, which he had attended as a young man in Denmark. Both stressed a relationship to a region and to the soil itself, providing Jensen with an intuitive philosophical base that rooted his conservation and ecological interests and his landscaping career. Jensen's students were encouraged to learn by doing, integrating an intellectual life with the development of practical skills, social responsibility and environmental stewardship. Jensen spent the last years of his life building the school, teaching, writing, welcoming visitors, traveling and lecturing -- a tireless crusader for preservation efforts, constantly stressing the necessity of setting aside large tracts of wilderness for future generations. With his students, he continued to explore the landscape itself -- its dunes, bogs, swamps, cliffs, rocks, forests, fields, rivers, streams, pools, prairies, ledges, and lakes -- sharing his fervent belief that nature stirs and quiets the soul, providing sustenance for the imagination and inner harmony.</p>

    <arrangement>
      <p>The Jens Jensen Drawings and Papers are organized into four series: Architectural Drawings; Manuscripts; Photographs; and Additional Drawing Description. The ca. two thousand drawings are arranged alphabetically by client or project and stored in oversize flat file drawers. The drawings represent Jensen's work from ca. 1903 until his retirement in 1934.</p>
      <p>The remaining three series together total approximately two linear feet of material. The first is a relatively small accumulation of manuscript material, including correspondence, lectures, and writings. Researchers should note that most of this material was collected by Leonard Eaton in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The collection also includes photographs commissioned by Eaton of Jensen designed parks and estates and a set of glass plate negatives of plantlife created by Jensen.</p>

      <p>Jensen's landscape work encompassed a broad range of projects -- residential, subdivisions, parks and preserves, schools and educational facilities, hospitals, office complexes and government centers, all of which are represented in the collection. Jensen's view of landscape architecture as a social force for integrating art, home, and commerce is a significant and unique characteristic of his work. While the native landscape itself, both as he experienced it in Denmark and in America, was his primary inspiration, Jensen was also influenced by the social and economic reform movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His theories related to urban planning, his recognition of the restorative value of nature and wilderness, his genuine concern for the environment, and his love of people are reflected in the material and will interest researchers from a range of disciplines and subject areas -- although the documentation is almost wholly visual.</p>
      <p>When looked upon as a whole, the collection richly illustrates Jensen's consistent philosophy of design. While each project had its own character reflecting the nature of the site and client requirements, certain recurring design features in the drawings are evidence of Jensen's particular style. His plans almost always show plants in masses -- creating unity through repetition of similar species, textures, and forms and suggesting groupings found in native habitats. The hawthorn, with its low, horizontal branching habit, a symbol of the prairie for Jensen, is found often in his designs, along with other small native trees, sometimes scattered individually, but more often in repetition to reinforce prairie views and provide a transition to larger trees along woodland borders. Also evident is the adept handling of open spaces found at the core of most of his designs -- great meadows, linear "long views," prairie views and prairie vistas, sun openings, garden rooms, clearings. Smaller clearings and sun openings emphasize the importance Jensen placed on light and shadow as integral to the art of landscaping; a series of broad curving drives, footpaths, and trails invite movement and ensure that visitors experience sequences of sun and shade, sometimes leading "to the setting sun" or "to the rising sun." Water is another distinctive feature -- quiet pools, prairie rivers, lagoons, ponds, streams enhanced with rock work skillfully executed to suggest ravines and bluffs. The drawings also provide many examples of Jensen's council rings tucked into edges of woodland borders, surrounded by trees or placed to view a meadow or lake; player's greens created for outdoor drama; and small areas set aside and screened with walls, trellises, or shrubbery for vegetable and "picking" gardens.</p>

          <p>The Architectural Drawings series, containing over 1,700 drawings representing more than four hundred and sixty Jensen projects (including approximately thirty Chicago parks projects), are arranged alphabetically by project title, foldered, and stored in flat file drawers. The project title includes the geographic location when known and, for some projects, the name of the building architect. The item descriptions include the identifying code assigned by Jensen, drawing title, date of the drawing, and information on the format, size, medium (the material or process used to produce an image) and support (material on which drawing is produced) of the drawing. Some drawings have been scanned (from copy negatives) and are available online through the Bentley Library Image Bank.</p>
          <p>Jensen drawings are most frequently black ink or graphite on linen, sometimes with lines in red ink and borders, stepping stones, council rings and other features filled with yellow or brown ink. There are also a large number of drawings and sketches executed on tracing paper with graphite or black ink, sometimes combined with colored pencil and occasionally embellished with watercolor. Blueprints are rarely from Jensen's office, although they frequently have a few pencil markings. Nearly all of the linen and tracing paper plans hold Jensen's distinctive signature, and many include a note warning that "composition will suffer" if changes are made to the plan. Researchers interested in more item-level detail, including size of a drawing and description of its contents, will want to refer to the index cards prepared by the Art and Architecture Library, which are in box 3 of the collection. There is also a photocopy version of the index, which is available for use from the reference archivist.</p>
          <p>There are nearly one hundred drawings of Chicago Parks in the collection. Of particular note for those interested in Jensen's contributions to conservation and his visionary concepts in urban planning are two projects: Proposed Park Extension: West Chicago Park Commission (1918) and A Greater West Park System (1919). Also important are drawings for Jensen's celebrated Columbus Park, which he considered his most successful. Humboldt Park, Douglas Park and Garfield Park, executed earlier, are equally significant for tracing the evolution of Jensen's career in the public realm. Among the parks represented beyond the Chicago area are designs for the Lincoln Garden, Springfield, Illinois; Racine, Wisconsin; Benton Harbor, Michigan; Oak Park, Illinois; Pasadena, California (blueprints only); Glencoe, Illinois; and River Forest, Illinois. Unlike most of Jensen's public work, the Racine park system (thirty original drawings) survives today much as Jensen planned it, as does the Lincoln Garden, Jensen's last major public design. While there are thirteen original drawings and six prints for various Springfield, Illinois projects, there are, unfortunately, only two prints in the collection of the Lincoln Garden.</p>
          <p>The most fully documented Residential projects are two that Jensen executed for Edsel Ford -- Grosse Pointe, Michigan (1926-1932), Albert Kahn, architect; and Seal Harbor, Maine (1922-1926), Duncan Candler, architect. The two together total forty-one original drawings and six blueprints. The Grosse Point Shores estate has been reported to be the most expensive and extensive of any of Jensen's residential designs. The Seal Harbor project is of particular interest because it was the only major work Jensen ever undertook in the East, where he worked to create a garden that would fit into "the ruggedness and mystery" of the coast. Another important residence is the Henry B. Babson house, Riverside, Illinois (1909-1911), a collaboration with Louis Sullivan. Drawings include a topographical survey, grading plan, designs for entrance and grape arbors, and planting plans. The landscape scheme reflects and accentuates the horizontal lines of the prairie house; crab apples are sited to frame a view of it and of the nearby open "prairie" space. The prairie style as a collaboration is also evident in two projects with Frank Lloyd Wright -- the Avery Coonley house in Riverside, Illinois (1908-1917) and the Sherman M. Booth place in Glencoe, Illinois (1911-1912). In addition, researchers will find the sixteen original drawings for the Harry Rubens estate in Glencoe, Illinois (1902; George Maher, architect) a particularly fine example of an early integration of design elements that came to signify the Jensen style. Other relatively early and important projects undertaken with prairie school architects for which there are significant drawings are the I.B. Grommes house in Lake Geneva (1902), Richard Schmidt, architect; and the August Magnus house in Winnetka, Illinois (1905), Robert Spencer, architect.</p>
          <p>Additional notable residential work in the collection includes the E.L. Ryerson Estate, Lake Forest, Illinois, (1912); the Wallace W. Gill Place, Glencoe, Illinois (1922); the Harold Florsheim Place, Highland Park, Illinois (1926-1928); the Harley Clark Place, Evanston, Illinois (1928); the Julius Rosenwald Estate (1911), and the E.F. Simms Estate, Paris, Kentucky (1915). The Gill Place is of particular interest because it is a smaller project than most, yet a carefully designed example of landscape art; the Florsheim estate is an excellent illustration of the skillfulness Jensen brought to rock work -- in this case overlooking a Lake Michigan ravine.</p>
          <p>Jensen's interest in Schools and Education spanned his career, from his notion of the underutilization of schools as a center for lifelong learning while designing for Chicago parks, to the establishment of The Clearing, the school he developed in Wisconsin. Influenced by his experiences in Danish folk schools, Jensen believed that the grounds of schools and educational settings could -- and should -- play a major role in enhancing learning. The collection illustrates his theories in designing for very young children with the Avery Coonley Kindergarten in Downer's Grove, Illinois, a project undertaken with Frank Lloyd Wright as one example, to settings for adolescents, such as the Manitowac, Wisconsin High School with architect Dwight Perkins as another. Drawings for Manitowac include a council ring, a court of debates, a rock of wisdom, play rings, campfire areas, study rings, and a player's hill with torch. Researchers interested in Jensen's orientation to the landscape as it intersects with education and urban planning will also want to look at his Chicago park work, particularly the neighborhood centers, such as those he designed for Lloyd and Logan schools. The Helen Pierce School of Chicago and the theater area of the University of Wisconsin are also a part of the collection. Researchers should note that a distinguishing characteristic of Jensen's work for children (he was a charter member of the Chicago chapter of the Playground Association of America) are his playgrounds, which were comprised of a variety of settings and types of spaces deliberately designed to encourage creativity, imaginative play, dreaming and reflection, and open-ended interaction with the natural world.</p>
          <p>Jensen's unwavering belief in the restorative power of nature is evident in his designs for Hospital grounds. Plans generally include curving footpaths, flower gardens, council rings and tranquil water systems, and often incorporate orchards, vegetable gardens, "picking" gardens into the landscape -- all intended to provide a restful setting and aid in the healing process. The drawings for the grounds of the Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium include details for campsites and campfire areas. The collection also has drawings for Decatur Memorial Hospital, Decatur, Illinois; Edward Hines, Jr. Hospital in Maywood, Illinois; the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit; and the Milwaukee Convalescent Home.</p>
          <p>Miscellaneous types of projects Jensen undertook include highways, golf courses, hotels, office complexes, government centers, suburban subdivisions, and monuments. There are examples of each in the collection. Of special note is his landscape work for the Lincoln Highway Association -- plans for the "ideal section," which he designed to reflect a prairie setting. Jensen included wide hiking trails that wound across the prairie and among the native grasses, flowers, hawthorns, crabapples. His plans incorporated a rest area, campsites, and council rings. There are twenty-three original drawings in the Lincoln Highway file, along with a number of prints. Drawings include suggested planting along a mile of prairie, a Lincoln Way concrete bridge, a detail for lamp post and memorial seat, and plans for the ideal section tourist camp.</p>

          <p>The Manuscripts Series (ca. 1920-1960; .5 linear ft.), while limited in extent and scope, is particularly valuable because it is the only source of information in the collection beyond the visual. The series includes background material collected by Leonard Eaton, Eaton's handwritten notes, Jensen correspondence with clients, letters written on behalf of Friends of Our Native Landscape, and items Jensen mailed to the editors of various newspapers. (Unfortunately, much of the client communication was photocopied from fading thermofax and is difficult to read.) The series also includes a few lecture notes, a handful of published material both by and about Jensen, and a typescript of the Chicago Tribune obituary of October 2, 1951.</p>

          <p>The bulk of the Photographs (ca. 1913-1960; 1.5 linear ft.) series is a set of glass plate negatives of Midwestern native plants taken by Jensen and associated contact prints. (Prints were prepared by the Art and Architecture Library, University of Michigan, date unknown). The glass plates were removed from brittle and crumbling paper envelopes and placed in acid-free housing. Titles, place names, and date of exposure were transcribed from the envelopes. Because of the fragile nature of these negative images, researchers are asked to view the contact prints, rather than the original glass plates.</p>
          <p>There are also a number of photographs and negatives of Jensen designed parks and estates as they appeared in the mid 1950s and early 1960s (commissioned by Leonard Eaton). In some cases, Robert Fine is identified on the verso as the photographer; in other examples, the photographer is unknown. Very often these folders also contain 4 x 5 inch negatives. Occasionally the image is of a Jensen drawing rather than the developed property.</p>
          <p>The series also includes copy negatives of drawings that have been photographed. Researchers should consult the drawer listing of the finding aid to determine which drawings have copy negatives (example: neg: TIL 1)</p>
