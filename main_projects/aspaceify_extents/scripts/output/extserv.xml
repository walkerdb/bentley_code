      <p>The Extension Division of the University of Michigan was formally organized by the Board of Regents in 1911. The major purposes of the Extension Division were to serve the general cause of education and advancement of culture in the state, to provide local communities with the technical and experimental knowledge of the university faculty, and to acquaint members of the various faculties with local conditions throughout the state. The bylaws of the Extension Division also stated that only those areas of university activity which have their roots in campus programs may be carried throughout the state.</p>
      <p>The first responsibility of the Extension Division was the management of the Educational Lecture Bureau. President H. B. Hutchins named William D. Henderson of the Physics Department as part-time director of this program. With the support of President Hutchins and the Board of Regents, the scope of the Extension Division's operations grew from the administration of lectures, to a small number of credit classes which began in Detroit in 1913, and then to a program that served nearly a dozen Michigan communities with lectures and credit courses by the mid-twenties.</p>
      <p>In the period between 1935 and 1950 the Extension Service experienced tremendous growth. Enrollment increased from 3,500 to 21,000. The main reason for this increase was the opening of six regional offices throughout the state. The first of the offices was established in Detroit in 1935 at the university's Horace H. Rackham Educational Memorial Building. Later offices were set up in Grand Rapids, Flint, Saginaw, Ann Arbor, and Escanaba. The development of regional area offices made it possible to present and develop long-range programs in various fields.</p>
      <p>In the post World War II era the Extension Service actively developed new programs and regional offices. Some of these programs flourished, e.g. music, art, gerontology, real estate, and firemanship training; others, the Worker's Educational Program for example, were abandoned. The credit courses offered through the Extension Service gradually became more oriented towards the graduate student. By 1980, nearly 95% of the credit courses offered through the Extension Service were for graduate credit.</p>
      <p>The Extension Service was reduced by 90% in 1981. The report of the budget review subcommittee investigating the Extension Service unanimously recommended that the University of Michigan Extension Service should be discontinued as an administrative unit. This included the transfer of all off-campus instruction activities to the appropriate academic unit and the discontinuance or transfer of all credit-free activities.</p>
      <p>The Extension Service has had five directors. The first, William D. Henderson, served as part-time director from 1912 to 1919. In 1919 he was appointed director and held that position until his retirement in 1937. Henderson was succeeded by Charles A. Fisher. Fisher had been the assistant director under Henderson and was the director of the Extension Service from 1937 until his death in 1948. Everett J. Soop became director in 1948 and served until his retirement in 1970. Alfred Storey, who had been assistant director, succeeded Soop. He retired from this position in 1989. Glenda Radine, director of the Department of Conferences and Institutes, was appointed as interim director. She served in this capacity until the Extension Service was reconfigured in 1995 and its activities incorporated into the Academic Outreach unit. Academic Outreach, created to manage non-traditional instruction programs and distance education, was dissolved in 1999.</p>
      <p>The Firemanship Training Program</p>
      <p>The Firemanship Training Program grew out of the Michigan Fire College that was begun in 1928 to train fire personnel in techniques of fire fighting. The Fire College found a permanent home at the University of Michigan in 1941. The following year, the Department of Extension Services in conjunction with the School of Education set up classes to train fire department instructors. Chief Wallace Gannon of the Muskegon Fire Department came to the school in 1942 to be the instructor for the year. He returned in 1946 and was full-time instructor until 1953. In 1943, the program was expanded to include off-campus courses in fire fighting techniques. The programs became very popular and from 1946 to 1960 over 15,000 fire fighters participated in these programs.</p>
      <p>With demand rising for these programs, it was soon apparent that a permanent facility was needed where residential training could take place. A new facility was proposed in 1955 and the Civil Defense and Disaster Training Center was completed in 1959. Francis Hartman, who had been involved with the program from the beginning, became the first director of the new center and program. He was succeeded by Arthur Appel who retired in 1978, and was succeeded by Robert Schultz, former assistant director, in 1978.</p>
      <p>The first residential fire school at the new facility was held August 17-28, 1959. This new building provided for even further expansion of the program. The courses offered were expanded to include three residential schools in fire training-- basic, intermediary, advanced--, a longer 240-hour academy, and numerous yearly conferences in the areas of arson control, fire chief training, industrial fire control, fire instruction, state property fire control, and civil defense training.</p>
      <p>The 90% reduction in Extension Services in 1981 had its effect on the Firemanship Training Program. Money was no longer available to support the program as before and offerings and enrollments were declining. In 1991, the program was transferred to the Housing Division, Department of Conferences and Seminars. The last residential fire school was held in July 1992. The department continued to offer the various conferences and seminars until 1994 when they canceled all offerings except for a conference on fire control. The Civil Defense and Disaster Center is currently used by the Ann Arbor Fire Department as a substation.</p>
      <p>Academic Outreach</p>
      <p>In 1995, the Extension Service, as an independently functioning University department, was abolished and its services incorporated into Academic Outreach. This office was created to coordinate the University's increasingly varied efforts to extend its educational mission of teaching, research, and service beyond the University's residential campus. One of its major responsibilities is to find constructive ways to expand the University's learning environment through technology. The University of Michigan Virtual Campus and the Michigan Virtual Auto College are examples of several resultant programs. Academic Outreach was disbanded in 1999. Several of the unit's responsibilities were transferred to the Media Union as well as to other units on campus. (See University Record, February 22, 1999 "Media Union to Provide Learning Technology Support" for information on the dissolution of Academic Outreach.)</p>

          <p>The Director's Office Files, dated 1912-1994, include the Extension Service's annual reports, minutes of the executive committee and staff meetings, financial records, enrollment records, and topical files. Also included are specific reports and surveys and the personal files of the first three directors: William D. Henderson, Charles A. Fisher, and Everett J. Soop. The bulk of material in the Director's Office Files are the Topical Files. There are four separate runs of topical files: 1912-1959, 1959-1972, ca. 1936-1980 and 1950-1994. The topical files are arranged alphabetically. Some of the more important files concern adult education, Extension Service conferences and institutes, civil defense and disaster training, and the Michigan Coordinating Council of State College Field Services.</p>

            <p>The Topical File, ca. 1936-1980 in part continues the subjects listed in the 1982 accession. The most significant file is the "Evaluation and Planning Project." This was a university-wide project begun in 1973 in response to the budget crisis of the 1970s. The project was conducted in three phases: I) articulation of unit objectives and operations implications; II) evaluation of operations in light of objectives described in phase I; and III) exploration of directions and alternative courses of action. The file includes a number of internal and external reports and studies, questionnaires, and statistics on enrollment, funding and expenses. It provides an interesting look at the Extension Service's goals and objectives and the range of its programs in the early 1970s. Other significant files include the High School Correspondence Studies Reports, Community College Advisory Committee, the Rackham Building (Detroit) anniversaries, and Washtenaw Community College.</p>
