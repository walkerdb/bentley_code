    <bioghist>
      <p>Gunnar Birkerts is an internationally acclaimed architect of the last half of the twentieth century who has been recognized for his expressive forms, his simplification of detail, his innovative work with surface materials and his effective use of indirect daylight. With his design flexibility and commitment to "finding poetry in building technology," he has pushed beyond the boundaries of the Modern Movement. [1]</p>
      <p>Born on January 17, 1925, in Riga, Latvia, Gunnar Birkerts' childhood was steeped in the mythology of his country, as both of his parents, Peteris and Merija Shop Birkerts, were scholars and folklorists who studied the cultural heritage of the Latvian people. Later in his career, Birkerts expressed his gratitude for the rich, architectural and literary images of his homeland which he believed continued to stimulate his creative process.</p>
      <p>While attending the first gymnasium in Riga, Birkerts saw an architectural rendering of an upperclassman which inspired him at the age of thirteen to pursue a career in this field. He completed two degrees in engineering and architecture in 1949 at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, where his training exposed him to both Bauhaus and vernacular design. His education in the craft and technology program gave him an understanding of architectural materials and design construction methodology, which would become enduring interests throughout his career.</p>
      <p>During his training, Gunnar Birkerts studied the work of Alvar Aalto, Gunnar Asplund, Sven Markelius and Sigurd Lewerentz in Europe and that of Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn and Marcel Breuer, who had emigrated to the United States. William Lescaze and Frank Lloyd Wright were also of interest to him. However, it was at the U.S. Information Agency Library that he discovered and became attracted to the modern architecture of Eliel and Eero Saarinen with whom he shared northern European roots. Thus, he came to Birmingham, Michigan in December 1949 to seek work with Eero Saarinen, who explained to him upon his arrival in Birmingham, Michigan, that the General Motors Technical Center project was on hold and that no job was available for him. Carrying a letter of recommendation from Saarinen, Birkerts went to Chicago to join the firm of Perkins and Will, which specialized in school architecture. Within a year of his arrival in the United States, he married Sylvia Zvirbulis. Together they had three children, Sven Peter, Andra Sylvia and Erik Gunnar, born in 1951, 1954 and 1967, respectively.</p>
      <p>In 1951, Eero Saarinen invited Birkerts to join his firm in Birmingham, Michigan, where he worked with such young architects as Kevin Roche, Robert Venturi and John Dinkeloo. During his four years with Saarinen, he contributed to the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan and Concordia Senior College in Fort Wayne, Indiana and was the project architect for the Milwaukee County War Memorial. In 1954, he won the young Designer of the Year Award from the Akron Museum of Art. Birkerts was highly impressed by Saarinen's inventiveness and perseverance, qualities which he carried into his own work. He recalls that "in those days it was a battle to bring modern architecture to the world. The whole quest was evangelistic." [2]</p>
      <p>Birkerts received American citizenship in 1955, shortly after leaving Saarinen's office to join Donald Grieb in Milwaukee. After one year with Grieb, he was invited by Minoru Yamasaki to work with Yamasaki, Leinweber and Associates, in Birmingham, Michigan. There he was chief designer for the Reynolds Metals Building, the Educational Building at Wayne State University and the Daharan Air Terminal between 1956 and 1959. During this time, he received a number of design awards, including two citations from <title render="italic">Progressive Architecture</title> for houses in Wisconsin and first prize in the Cantu, Italy First International Furniture Competition. He was especially proud of the latter because Alvar Aalto, highly esteemed by Birkerts, was one of the jurists.</p>
      <p>In 1959, Birkerts became a principal of Minoru Yamasaki and Associates. Despite his admiration for Yamasaki's intuitive creation process, Birkerts thought, "I had listened long enough. My apprenticeship was over. Now it was my turn to speak." [3] Accordingly, he left Yamasaki in 1959 to establish the partnership of Birkerts and Straub. With Frank Straub as project administrator and Birkerts as designer, they produced their first independent projects, including the Schwartz Summer Residence (1960-1962) in Northville, Michigan, the Haley Funeral Home (1960-1961) in Southfield, Michigan, the 1300 Lafayette East Apartments (1961-1963) in Detroit, the Marathon Oil Office Building (1962-1964) in Detroit and the Lillibridge Elementary School Addition (1962-1963) in Detroit.</p>
      <p>Birkerts began his twenty-nine-year teaching career at the University of Michigan at this time as well. In 1961, he was appointed assistant professor of architecture, becoming associate professor of architecture in 1963 and professor of architecture in 1969. He was awarded the position of professor emeritus in 1990.</p>
      <p>Gunnar Birkerts and Associates was established in 1963 in Birmingham, Michigan, when the architect left his partnership with Frank Straub. The 1960s were prolific years for the practice, as Birkerts designed buildings which contained the "bold forms, space before structure, minimal detailing, stratified walls and daylight in interior spaces" which were the hallmarks of his work during this decade.[4] Among his many important buildings of this period were the University Reformed Church (1960-1964) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the Detroit Institute of Arts - South Wing Addition (1964), the Fisher Administrative Center (1964-1966) at the University of Detroit, the Lincoln Elementary School (1965-1967) in Columbus, Indiana, the Freeman Residence (1964-1966) in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Tougaloo College Campus Master Plan (1965) in Tougaloo, Mississippi, the Tougaloo College Dormitories and Library (1966-1972) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (1967-1973).</p>
      <p>During the 1970s, Birkerts continued his exploration of glass and metal as surface technologies. He was also an early advocate for the containment of urban sprawl with his Subterranean Urban Systems Study of 1974, for which he received a Fellowship Grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. In 1970, he was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and he received a Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects, Detroit, in 1975. He was also honored by an appointment as Architect in Residence at the American Academy in Rome in 1976. A few of his many notable buildings of this decade are the Contemporary Arts Museum (1970-1972) in Houston, the Dance Instructional Facility (1970-1976) at the State University of New York, Purchase, the University of Michigan Law School Addition (1974-1981) in Ann Arbor, the United States Embassy Office Building (1975, project) in Helsinki, Finland, the Duluth Public Library (1969-1980), the Museum of Glass (1976-1980) in Corning, New York, and the University of Iowa College of Law Building (1979-1986) in Iowa City.</p>
      <p>Birkerts received many more awards in the 1980s and 1990s, including the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize in Architecture from The American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1981) and the first Bruce Alonzo Goff Professorship of Creative Architecture (1990) at the University of Oklahoma. In a poll conducted by <title render="italic">The Buildings Journal</title> of 58 architecture academicians in 1982, Gunnar Birkerts was listed as one of the top ten architects of non-residential structures in the nation, along with I. M. Pei, Romaldo Giurgola, Cesar Pelli, Kevin Roche, Philip Johnson, Michael Graves, Charles Moore, Edward Larrabee Barnes and Richard Meier. Among his important buildings of this period are the Ferguson Residence (1980-1983) in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the Cornell University Uris Library Addition (1980-1982) in Ithaca, New York, the Conservatory of Music Library Addition (1986-1988) in Oberlin, Ohio, and the United States Embassy Office Building (1987-89) in Caracas, Venezuela.</p>
      <p>In 1997, Birkerts dissolved Gunnar Birkerts and Associates. He is continuing his practice of architecture from his studio in Bloomfield Hills. Now in the fifth decade of his prolific career, Birkerts is designing the Joint Library of the City of San Jose and San Jose State University in California, the first institution in the country to combine the repositories of a university and a city under one roof. Such other recent works as the Ohio State University College of Law Addition (1988-1993) in Columbus, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art and Design (1991-1994) of the Kansas City Art Institute, and the National Library (1989 - in progress) in Riga, Latvia are testament to the innovation, monumentality and freedom of Birkerts' "expressive architecture."[5] The National Library exemplifies Birkerts' powerful use of metaphor which has characterized his work throughout his career and has made his buildings among the most distinctive of the twentieth century.</p>

      <p>The Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection offers researchers a rich perspective on the work of one of the masters of American modern architecture whose career spans the second half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. The initial accessions of Birkert's material encompassed 69 linear feet of the firm's textual records, which are associated with 14 of Birkerts' distinguished buildings, and 7158 original drawings and prints documenting the evolution of the architectural design process for each project. In 2008, the records and drawings of 74 more projects were included in the collection, bringing the total amount of textual material to 82 linear feet and the number of drawings to over 10,000. Altogether, these visual materials detail many of the expressive elements for which Birkerts' architecture is renowned, including his bold forms, simplification of detail, innovative selection of surface materials and dramatic use of indirect light. Although six of the buildings in the original collection of 14 projects are located in Michigan, along with the offices of the firm, nine other structures were built in New York, Indiana, Mississippi and Minnesota, testimony to the national scope of this architectural practice. The following buildings were selected for inclusion in the collection by Birkerts and Bentley Historical Library staff because they represent the significance, diversity and evolution of the architect's work:
        <list type="simple"><item>Haley Funeral Home (1960-1961)</item><item>University Reformed Church (1960-1964)</item><item>Freeman Residence (1964-1966)</item><item>Lincoln Elementary School (1965-1967)</item><item>Tougaloo College Master Plan, Library and Dormitories (1965-1972)</item><item>Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (1967-1973)</item><item>Duluth Public Library (1969-1980)</item><item>S.U.N.Y., Purchase, Dance Instructional Facility (1970-1976)</item><item>Corning Municipal Fire Station (1973-1974)</item><item>Calvary Baptist Church (1974-1977)</item><item>University of Michigan Law Library Addition (1974-1981)</item><item>Corning Museum of Glass (1976-1980)</item><item>Ferguson Residence (1980-1983)</item><item>St. Peter's Lutheran church (1981-1988)</item><item>Additional Projects (added in 2008)</item></list>
      </p>
      <p>The initial accessions Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection are arranged in 14 series, each of which contains the business records and architectural drawings for one building. The finding aid begins with a description of the narrative records in chronological order in each series. An item-level description of the architectural and engineering drawings follows, grouping drawings in folders according to design phases, as described above. The finding aid lists the titles of drawings, when they exist, as well as title bar information including original dates, revision dates, numeric sequencing and, in some cases, names of consulting engineers. A description of the medium and support of each drawing is also given.</p>
      <p>The 2008 accession to the collection includes of documentation of 74 additional projects consisting of 3,000 drawings and 13 linear feet of textual materials and photographs. The documentation for these projects is generally not as extensive as for the fourteen in the original accessions and the finding aid does not describe them in as great detail. They have been grouped together as single series titled "Other Projects" and the individual projects are listed in alphabetical order by project title</p>
      <p>One of the collection's greatest strengths is found in its emphasis on the architectural design process, offering researchers a broad, visual representation of the evolution of each building through the "Schematic Design," "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences. Because Gunnar Birkerts and Associates meticulously saved each drawing associated with the firm's projects, this collection provides an exceptional view of the daily design process, as solutions were sought which defined the architectural character and individuality of a structure. Each of the 14 buildings in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection is conceived as an individual series, which contains the textual and visual documents associated with the project. Within each of the 14 series, the architectural and engineering drawings are arranged chronologically by design phase, beginning with "Schematic Design," when the owner's program is analyzed and sketches are drawn to illustrate the scale and relationship of the project's components. Researchers interested in viewing the earliest conceptual drawings associated with each building are encouraged to consult the finding aid of the collateral <title render="italic" linktype="simple" href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-02103" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Gunnar Birkerts Collection</title>, which amasses the sketches by the architect's own hand for most of his projects. Digital images of 284 of these conceptual sketches can be seen online in the Bentley Historical Library Image Bank through <title render="italic" linktype="simple" href="http://bentley.umich.edu/legacy-support/birkerts.php" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Gunnar Birkerts, Conceptual Drawings</title>. An understanding of the beginning stage of design for each building is best obtained by studying the conceptual and "Schematic Design" documents in both the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection and the Gunnar Birkerts Collection.</p>
      <p>The second "Design Development" stage in each building series includes more precise site plans, floor plans, elevations and sections which further define the dimensions, mechanical/electrical systems, building materials and architectural character of the project. This phase often ends with the production of artistic presentation drawings which are used to obtain the client's approval of the design. Although the collection contains a large majority of original sketches and drawings on tracing paper, vellum, linen and mylar, many blue-line and sepia prints have been retained in each series if they are substitutes for missing originals or if they are annotated and thus show the ongoing search for solutions in the evolution of the design process.</p>
      <p>Each series in the collection also records the third "Construction Document" phase, during which the final working drawings are developed before being sent to contractors for bids. These drawings are the graphic representation of the written "Specifications," included in the textual records of every series. The "Construction Documents" for each building, which were often revised to show changes after construction began, may be of significant value to historic preservationists or future owners seeking to restore the building to its original condition or adapt it to a new use.</p>
      <p>The Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection is also significant in its pairing of the visual documentation described above with the textual records of each building, which describe the decisions and actions of the firm during the design and construction process. Thus, scholars can read the program information, specifications, addenda and memoranda associated with the architectural drawings during each chronological stage of the building's design. Written contracts, correspondence, transmittals and field inspection reports further inform historians about the relationship between the firm and its clients, contractors, consulting engineers, landscape architects and sub-contractors, documenting in rich detail the business affairs of a nationally known architectural firm in the second half of the twentieth century. Of particular value within the narrative records of each building series is the "Architect's Conceptual Statement". These statements offer design and history students an opportunity to understand the interchange of objective and subjective influences on Mr. Birkerts' creative process and the solutions which define the architectural character of each building.</p>
      <p>The Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection is also of exceptional value to scholars because it represents the end of the era of hand-drawn architectural documents. By the end of the twentieth century, many architects have begun to use the computer in the development of design and construction drawings. However, this collection of the original 14 buildings contains only drawings which show the flow of the creative process from the brain, through the hand, to the paper. Even drawings which are marked "void" are retained because, like annotated prints, they show the evolution of the design as the search for architectural solutions begins to define the building. Whereas the use of computer-aided design would undoubtedly delete many intermediary design drawings from a collection, this aggregation of hand-drawn documents shows the artistry and complexity of the creative process. The beauty of the architect's pencil line on delicate tracing paper, smooth vellum and opaque mylar is preserved here for future generations of scholars, just as its use in the late 1990s is being abandoned by many architects.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Gunnar Birkerts donated a large collection of 7,840 color 35 mm slides, associated with the design and construction of 123 projects, documenting through photographs the work of his entire career. This additional collection is encompassed in the series titled, "Photographic Slides of Projects."</p>

          <p>The Haley Funeral Home (0.1 linear feet, 38 drawings; 1960-1985) in Southfield, Michigan, designed in 1960 and completed in 1961, is the earliest building in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection and was one of Mr. Birkerts' first independent projects of his Birkerts and Straub partnership. The Haley Funeral Home and University Reformed Church are the only two buildings by the Birkerts and Straub firm which are housed in the collection of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates, founded later in 1963. With its steep, hipped, overhanging roofs which express the function and location of the three main chapels within, the Haley Funeral Home recalls the traditional cemetery structures of the architect's Nordic heritage. The sheltering eaves and narrow, projecting windows contribute to the psychological sense of serenity, protection and separation engendered by the design. Although the symmetry of this building reflects the influence of Minoru Yamasaki in Mr. Birkerts' earliest work, a study of later projects in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection will show a gradual progression towards his signature, organic asymmetry of design.</p>
          <p>The Haley Funeral Home series encompasses both textual and visual materials, including a tenth of a linear-foot of written records and 38 original pencil and ink drawings on vellum. Within the firm's textual records, researchers will find the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" of interest in understanding the design of the building and the interplay of psychological, spatial and technical considerations in Mr. Birkerts' creative process. The firm's correspondence regarding this building is limited to a few letters and transmittals from the years 1974 to 1985, over a decade after the building was constructed.</p>
          <p>The drawings in the Haley Funeral Home series are arranged chronologically by phase of architectural design, beginning with "Design Development" and moving through the "Construction Document" sequence. Researchers should note that the conceptual and "Schematic Design" drawings associated with the first phase of the architectural design process are found in the Gunnar Birkerts Collection, which amasses all of the conceptual drawings by the architect's own hand. Please refer to the finding aid of the Gunnar Birkerts Collection for a full listing of the nine, valuable, preliminary, Haley Funeral Home floor plans and elevations by Mr. Birkerts which are housed in this second collateral, collection.</p>
          <p>The 38 drawings in the Haley Funeral Home series of the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection include 10 original "Design Development" drawings and 28 "Construction Documents," offering researchers a view of the evolution of the building's design from April, 1960, through March, 1961, when "Supplementary Details" to the working documents were drawn. The "Construction Documents" include architectural, mechanical and electrical drawings, issued on August 1, 1960, with revisions through December, 1960, noted in pencil on the original vellum documents.</p>

          <p>University Reformed Church (0.5 linear feet, 247 drawings; 1960-1986) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, designed in 1960 and completed in 1964, is one of two projects of Mr. Birkerts' first architectural firm, Birkerts and Straub, which are included in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection. Considered by many to be one of his finest buildings, University Reformed Church is known for three characteristics which have become hallmarks of Mr. Birkerts' expressive, organic architecture throughout his fifty-year career: the innovative use of indirect light, the massing of unadorned, bold forms, and the juxtaposition of symmetry and asymmetry. The wall planes of the church are illuminated by indirect daylight which enters through light boxes created by stiffening fins set a right angles to the upward-stepping, thin, concrete beams. The organic quality of this early, independent design is evident in the use of an asymmetrical altar to balance the basilica-like symmetry of the church nave, an interplay of opposites inspired by Mr. Birkerts' love of the natural world. Further evidence of the architect's interest in the juxtaposition of opposites is seen in the softness of wood used in the pews, railings and light fixtures which contrasts with the austerity of monumental, concrete, structural members.</p>
          <p>The University Reformed Church series contains .5 linear foot of the firm's written records, which describe the design and construction of the building, and 247 drawings, which show the evolution of the architectural design process from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" phases. This pairing of the written and visual records provides researchers with a rich, in-depth picture of both the business and design activities undertaken by Birkerts and Straub during the years of their partnership. The building was completed in 1964 after the founding of Mr. Birkerts' second firm, Gunnar Birkerts and Associates, in 1963.</p>
          <p>The written records of the series are arranged chronologically to follow the evolution of the design and construction process, which in turn is mirrored by the architectural drawings. The "Architect's Conceptual Statement" will be of interest to researchers seeking to understand the interplay of factors which influenced Mr. Birkerts' design. The "Specifications" of 9/18/62 describe in written detail the architect's requirements for the construction of the building and correspond directly to the "Construction Documents" of the same date, which visually define the project through architectural and engineering drawings. "Inter-Office Memoranda," "Transmittals" and "Correspondence In and Out" from 1960 through 1967 record the daily progress of the design and construction of the church. "Bulletins #1-7" document in words the revisions to the "Construction Documents" which are found in visual form on the drawings.</p>
          <p>The 247 drawings of University Reformed Church are also arranged chronologically to follow the development of the project through the "Schematic Design," "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences of the design process. Researchers interested in the earliest phase of design will find four folders of original Schematic Design drawings by Mr. Birkerts of preliminary floor plans, elevations and sections. Please note that 25 additional conceptual and Schematic Design sketches of University Reformed Church are contained in the Gunnar Birkets Collection, which houses drawings by the architect's own hand for most of his projects. Researchers are encouraged to refer to the finding aid of this collateral collection for a complete list of the conceptual drawings of the church.</p>
          <p>As the arrangement of visual records leads the researcher through the design process, the University Reformed Church series offers two folders of "Design Development" drawings and six folders of "Construction Documents". Although the majority of these are original pencil or ink on vellum drawings, some blue-line and sepia prints are included if they are annotated with original pencil markings or if the original drawings do not exist. The "Construction Documents" of 9/18/62 include "Addenda" and revision dates through 11/4/63, as well as a landscape plan by Johnson, Johnson &amp; Roy, completed in 1966. Researchers interested in the "Construction Documents" related to the engineering of the building will find one folder of "Structural Drawings" by Robert M. Darvas and one folder of "Mechanical/Electrical Drawings" by E. G. Siegel Associates.</p>

          <p>The Freeman Residence (0.25 linear feet, 66 drawings; 1964-1988) in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was designed in 1964 and completed in 1966, an early project of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates. The design of the house demonstrates Mr. Birkerts' ability to explore unconventional solutions to the programmatic requirements of his creative, risk-taking clients. In his fascination with the concept of superimposing an orthogonal over a radial planning grid, the architect designed a plan in which the atrium becomes the point in the building from which all other interior spaces radiate at different angles. While standing in this hub of the house, one can view other rooms through permanent wall openings or through windows which can be shielded with hinged panels. A conventionally framed, pyramidal roof over the atrium allows light to filter in past a second, inverted pyramid in the ceiling, which reflects natural and artificial light onto the wall spaces below. Mr. Birkerts' renowned, innovative use of light is also seen in the placement of angled, exterior, wing walls, which obstruct views of the interior from the outside, while at the same time serving as reflecting panels for the spaces within. He further allows indirect daylight into the house through light chambers, formed by the glazing between overlapping, horizontal, roof beams.</p>
          <p>The Freeman Residence series contains one-quarter of a linear foot of textual records, which document the program and construction phases of the building, and 66 drawings, which show the architectural design process from the "Design Development" through the "Construction Document" sequences. The combination of the written and visual records of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates offers researchers an unusually rich picture of the development of this residential project from conception to construction in the 1960s.</p>
          <p>Researchers interested in Mr. Birkerts' analysis of his design of the Freeman Residence will find the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" within the textual records to be illuminating. The "Program Correspondence" of April to August, 1964, also gives us a picture of the spatial requirements and design ideas of Harriette and Donald Freeman, as well as a glimpse into the relationship of high regard and trust between the architect and his clients. The written records are arranged chronologically and include "Memoranda," "Transmittals" and "Correspondence In and Out" which document the progression of the building.</p>
          <p>The 66 architectural and engineering drawings in the Freeman Residence series include one folder of original pencil on vellum "Design Development" drawings and three folders of original pencil on vellum "Construction Documents". Please note that three drawings of the Freeman Residence from the earliest "Schematic Design" phase of the design process are to be found in the Gunnar Birkerts Collection, which features conceptual sketches by the architect's own hand. Researchers are encouraged to consult the finding aid of this collateral, second collection of the architect's work for a full listing of conceptual drawings.</p>
          <p>In addition to the original 16 architectural "Construction Documents" dated 4/26/65 in this series, there are four mechanical/electrical pencil drawings on sepia prints. Prints are included in the collection when they are annotated with original pencil markings or when they are substitutes for missing originals. The architectural drawings show revisions through 10/6/65, and "Supplementary Construction Details" and "Construction Coordination Drawings" complete the picture of the design and building process.</p>

          <p>The Lincoln Elementary School (1.5 linear feet, 518 drawings; 1965-1967) was designed in 1965 and completed in 1967 in Columbus, Indiana, a town made famous by its collection of buildings by such modern architects as Eliel and Eero Saarinen, Kevin Roche, Richard Meier, I. M. Pei, Cesar Pelli, Edward Larrabee Barnes and Robert Venturi. Mr. Birkerts was invited to join this illustrious group by designing the Lincoln Elementary School, with funds provided by the Cummins Engine Foundation, whose support paid the architectural fees for 25 schools and civic buildings in Columbus. His creative energy was initially thrust into learning as much as he could about the heritage and culture of Columbus, where the 32,000 citizens had developed an appreciation of the fine architecture and landscapes which contributed to the character of their community.</p>
          <p>Mr. Birkerts' accumulated knowledge about the people and the school site had a great impact on his design concept, as he worked to minimize the impact of the building on the park which surrounded it. Thus, he made the building a simple square and lowered it one-half level below the street, shielding it further from view with a softening wall of trees atop a sheltering, circular berm. His signature, innovative use of lighting is seen in the skylight which illuminates the central multi-purpose room and the second story corridor overlooking it. He also conserves energy by providing one window for every two classrooms, deflecting daylight over the walls of the rooms. While building Lincoln Elementary School, Mr. Birkerts formed many good friendships with citizens who greatly appreciated his work. Fourteen years later in 1981, the congregation of St. Peter's Lutheran Church invited him to return to Columbus to design their new church, a building which is also included in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection.</p>
          <p>The Lincoln Elementary School series contains 1.5 linear feet of textual records, which chronologically document the design and construction of the building, and 518 drawings, which visually show the evolution of the architectural process from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences. The combination of the narrative and visual records establishes a rich, in-depth picture of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates' business and creative activities from the start to the finish of this project.</p>
          <p>Researchers interested in the history of the Cummins Engine Foundation's support of modern architecture in Columbus are directed to two articles from Interiors magazine within the firm's narrative records. Also of particular interest is the "Architect's Conceptual Statement," which illuminates Mr. Birkerts' interplay of subjective and objective ideas during his design process. "Land Use, Economic Base and Population Analyses" conducted by the City of Columbus in 1965 are evidence of the firm's information-gathering, considered vital to the program phase of the project. The textual records also include the building's "Specifications" of 2/21/66 and subsequent "Addendum #1" and "Bulletins #1-9," all of which provide the written directions and design revisions which are mirrored in the visual "Construction Documents" of the same dates. Researchers will find the "Memoranda" of 1/5/65 to 3/15/67 particularly helpful in understanding the decisions made with regard to the design and construction of the school. The chronologically arranged "Field Inspection Reports," "Transmittals" and "Correspondence In and Out" further document the evolution of the project as well as the relationships of the firm with consultants, contractor and client.</p>
          <p>The visual materials within the Lincoln Elementary School series include three folders of original drawings and photostatic prints from the "Schematic Design" phase of the architectural process. Please note that one valuable, original conceptual drawing can be found in the Gunnar Birkerts Collection, which houses the early drawings of many of his buildings by the architect's own hand. Researchers are encouraged to consult the finding aid of this second, collateral collection for a full listing of these important original conceptuals.</p>
          <p>The Lincoln Elementary School series of the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection offers "Design Development" documents from 11/65 to 1/66. These are both original pencil and ink on vellum and tracing paper drawings as well as blue-line prints. Prints are included in the collection when they are substitutes for missing originals or when they contain annotations of original pencil markings. Thus, they contribute to the researcher's understanding of the evolution of the building's design.</p>
          <p>The architectural drawings of the "Construction Document" phase of the process are especially interesting in showing the design changes made just a few weeks before the drafting of the final contract documents on 2/21/66. These "Check and Stick Sets" are annotated blue-line prints from 1/27/66 to 2/7/66. The final working drawings are pencil on vellum architectural originals by Gunnar Birkerts and Associates, as well as originals and prints of structural, mechanical/electrical and landscape drawings by consulting engineers and designers. Researchers may find Folder 12 to be of particular interest in understanding the architect's own views of the project, as it contains a set of architectural prints with Mr. Birkerts' orange pencil notations regarding his favorite design details. Three folders of "Shop Drawings" illuminate construction details relating to windows, structure, doors, elevators and interior and exterior equipment.</p>

          <p>The Tougaloo College (3 linear feet, 638 drawings; 1963-1981) series includes three linear feet of textual records and 638 drawings associated with three projects, the Tougaloo College Master Plan, 1965, and the Tougaloo College Library and Dormitories A and B, designed in 1966 and completed in 1972. The design of the Master Plan and buildings was driven by the optimism of the mid-1960s Civil Rights Movement, which predicted that Tougaloo College would grow from a student body of 500 to 2500 and would become the premier educational institution for African Americans in the country. In his own conceptual statement from GA Architect 2: Gunnar Birkerts and Associates (1982), Mr. Birkerts states: <blockquote><p>It is our belief that a plan should be developed which will impart, through simplicity and honesty in materials and forms, an image that would belong to Tougaloo alone - becoming a symbol for its future. I consider the commission to plan Touglaoo College as one of the most significant and challenging architectural commissions of this age.</p></blockquote></p>
          <p>Tougaloo College, founded in 1869 in Jackson, Mississippi, invited Gunar Birkerts to design the Master Plan with a grant from the Cummins Engine Foundation of Columbus, Indiana. The Foundation had underwritten the architectural fees of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates for the design of Lincoln Elementary School in 1965. The Master Plan subseries documentation within the Tougaloo College series includes one-half of a linear foot of textual records and 173 drawings, giving researchers a picture of the issues affecting the architectural design process during this turbulent era in Civil Rights history. With the intent of preparing students from predominantly rural backgrounds for a future in an urban world, the architect envisioned a flexible "layered city", a tiered concentration of circulation, academic and housing spaces, which would allow for future expansion to accommodate up to 2500 students. The optimism of the mid-1960s inspired Mr. Birkerts' visionary design of overlapping systems of linear academic and residential structures for Tougaloo College. However, the political climate of this era also resulted in the abandonment of the total Plan when private and federal funding failed to materialize and fewer African American students enrolled in black colleges. Only the Library and Dormitories A and B were built.</p>

            <p>The narrative records of the Master Plan subseries within the Tougaloo College series include the "Architect's Conceptual Statement", which articulately defines Mr. Birkerts' bold vision for the project. Also of interest to researchers will be the "Master Design Notebook," summarizing the programmatic needs of the administrative, academic, arts and service units of the school through its three planned phases of growth. "Continuity, Change and Commitment: An Institutional Self-Study" is a third document which illuminates the one-hundred year history of Tougaloo College and envisions the growth and excellence of the institution in its second century.</p>
            <p>The 173 architectural drawings associated with the Tougaloo College Master Plan subseries show the evolution of the project from the "Initial Master Plan Design Development" through the "Final Master Plan" phases of the architectural design process. Researchers should note that five conceptual drawings are housed in the Gunnar Birkerts Collection, which amasses the early drawings by the architect's own hand of many of his buildings. Please consult the finding aid of this second, collateral collection for a listing of the conceptual sketches and drawings.</p>
            <p>The Tougaloo College series of the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection also houses the "Design Development" documents of the Master Plan. These include both original pencil and ink drawings on vellum and linen as well as drawings on sepia and blue-line prints. Prints have been kept in the collection when they are substitutes for missing originals or when they are annotated with original drawings or notes. In these cases, prints are deemed to be just as important as originals in demonstrating the evolution of the design process. Both the "Design Development" and "Final Master Plan" drawings show the "Phasing Diagrams" which envision the three-tiered campus' capacity for expansion through all phases of its future growth.</p>

            <p>The Tougaloo College Library was one of three buildings completed on the campus in 1972 and was the prototype of the future academic matrix envisioned by the Master Plan. The design of the building was influenced by the requirement for expandability and the need to sink concrete caissons 60 feet into the Yazoo clay base until secure ground could be penetrated. Gunnar Birkerts used an innovative structural technology which combined poured-in-place, vertical posts and other precast, concrete members which were fabricated on site. The expandable structural system became a visually unifying element, as it defined both the interior and exterior spaces of the building.</p>
            <p>The Tougaloo College Library subseries includes one linear foot of narrative and photographic records and 219 architectural drawings. This combination of textual and visual records gives an in-depth picture of the architectural design process and the construction of the building from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" phases. The narrative records are arranged chronologically to reflect the evolution of the building. Researchers are encouraged to read the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" for a clear formulation of the ideas and program which inspired Mr. Birkerts' innovative design of the Tougaloo College Library. The "Specifications" of 10/30/69 are the written contract document which correspond to the visual "Construction Documents" of the same date. Together, they detail narratively and graphically the architect's directions and requirements for the project. Likewise, "Addenda #1-3" and "Bulletins #1-12" in the written records describe the changes to the "Construction Documents" which are represented visually in the drawings. An important collection of 55 8x10" photographs in Box 6 documents the Library's monthly construction progress from 6/4/70 through 7/16/71.</p>
            <p>The visual records associated with the Tougaloo College Library subseries are arranged chronologically to demonstrate all phases of the architectural design process. One folder of "Schematic Design" sketches contains the earliest original ink on tracing paper drawings of the building. Subsequent "Design Development" documents in six folders include both original pencil and ink on vellum drawings as well as blue-line and sepia prints. Prints are included in this collection when they are substitutes for original drawings or when they contain annotations which show design changes or solutions. Ink on linen and vellum "Presentation Drawings" are beautifully illustrative of the elevations and innovative structural system. The "Construction Documents" of 10/30/69 combine the architectural drawings of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates with the structural, mechanical and electrical drawings of consulting engineers. Finally, selected "Shop Drawings" document the details of the precast, concrete, structural system, which is a vital element of the Library's design.</p>

            <p>Tougaloo College Dormitories A and B are the second and third buildings constructed on campus in accordance with the 1965 Master Plan, which emphasized the close relationship between the residential, social and intellectual life of the students. When a preliminary brick and block design for Dormitory A of April, 1968, was estimated to be too expensive and discarded, a precast, concrete, bearing wall scheme was designed and accepted on 7/25/69. An innovative, Waldschmidt System, portable, construction plant was erected on site to expeditiously produce the precast, structural members for both the Dormitories and Library. Mr. Birkerts uses parallel rows of giant, concrete caissons to penetrate the unstable Yazoo clay and support the linear Dormitory buildings with pedestrian walkways underneath. He provides for both the privacy and social interaction of students by grouping dormitory rooms around common lounges. Although the multi-level Master Plan was never completely implemented, the Dormitories and Library are testimony to the flexibility and expandability of Mr. Birkerts' visionary design.</p>
            <p>The Tougaloo College Dormitories A and B subseries combines 1.5 linear feet of textual materials, which chronologically document the design and construction of the buildings, and 246 architectural drawings, which graphically illuminate the phases of the architectural design process. The pairing of the narrative and visual records gives design students, preservationists and other researchers a thorough understanding of the evolution of these buildings.</p>
            <p>Within the textual records, the undated paper by Gunnar Birkerts and Associates entitled, "The Development of A Construction Process for College Buildings Utilizing Industrial and Plant Construction Techniques," describes the innovative Waldschmidt System for fabricating concrete structural members on the site. The essay further discusses the challenges of meeting budget and scheduling demands over the course of this project. Researchers can also compare the written "Specifications" for the discarded, 1968 brick and block scheme with the "Specifications" for the 1969 precast, concrete, bearing wall scheme, which was used in the construction of the Dormitories. Also of special interest are the 126 8x10" black and white photographs of Dormitories A and B which document their monthly construction progress.</p>
            <p>The 246 drawings which make up the visual records for the Dormitories A and B subseries include one folder of early "Schematic Design" drawings from 1965, four folders of "Design Development" drawings and four folders of "Construction Documents" for both the 1968 and 1969 schemes, giving the researcher a view of the entire architectural design process. Drawings from all phases are both original pencil and ink on vellum documents and prints with original annotations or drawings on them. The ink on vellum "Design Development Presentation Drawings" are especially beautiful. The visual "Construction Documents," which correspond directly to the written "Specifications" in the textual records, show both the unbuilt, brick and block scheme which was discarded due to cost, and the precast, concrete, bearing wall scheme, which was built using the innovative Waldschmidt System.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (34 linear feet, 1676 drawings;1966-1989), designed in 1967 and completed in 1973, has received five design awards and critical acclaim in over 40 publications around the world. Mr. Birkerts was faced with the programmatic challenge of designing a building which provided an impregnable, underground space for vaults and armored truck ramps as well as an accessible, administrative office space above grade. The architect arrived at one of the most creative solutions of his career, designing a building which is considered a civic treasure by the citizens of Minneapolis. Because conventional support columns for the office building could not be sunk into the ground without disturbing the secure spaces beneath the 2.5-acre sloping plaza, Mr. Birkerts suspended the 11-story office structure from two catenary members, supported by granite-clad concrete towers 275 feet apart and a 30-foot-wide truss. Working on this braced, catenary scheme with Skilling, Helle, Christiansen, Robertson, Consulting Structural Engineers, Gunnar Birkerts designed one of the most significant buildings of the twentieth century whose boldness, honesty and monumentality are symbolic of the geological grandeur and the heroic pioneers of the region.</p>
          <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis series includes 34 linear feet of textual materials, which fully document the evolution and construction of the building, and 1676 architectural drawings, which graphically record the entire design process from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" phases. When studied together, the narrative and visual records give the researcher a rich understanding of the programmatic, design and construction sequences of this famous building's creation.</p>
          <p>The 34 linear feet of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates' records within the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis series include 14 boxes of the firm's design and construction files for the building and its interior, four boxes of construction progress photographs and slides and 16 boxes of "Shop Drawings", all arranged chronologically. Researchers interested in Mr. Birkerts' ideas regarding the design of the building are directed to the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" and the two articles from Architectural Forum and Architectural Record which follow. The 1967 "Planning Notebook" by Bank President Hugh Galusha, Jr., who provided vision and support to Mr. Birkerts during the design phase, is a comprehensive program document. Likewise, the "Program Records," which analyze soil, transportation, security, building requirements and Federal Reserve System coin movement issues, were important to the architect in gathering information which would affect his design of the building.</p>
          <p>Among the narrative records for this building, the "Specifications for General Contract" of 6/16/69 are especially important because they describe in writing the architect's requirements for the project, which are in turn defined graphically in the "Construction Documents" of the same date. The "Architectural and Structural Addenda" and "Bulletins #1-182" illuminate in writing the changes which were made to the "Specifications" before and during the construction process, corresponding exactly to revisions which are drawn and dated on the "Construction Documents." The pairing of the narrative and visual records for this and other Gunnar Birkerts and Associates' buildings is one of the strengths of this important architectural collection.</p>
          <p>Researchers interested in a detailed, narrative history of the Federal Reserve Bank's construction and the management of this phase by Gunnar Birkerts and Associates are directed to "Memoranda # 1-702," the "Contractors Weekly Meeting Reports," the "GB&amp; Field Representative's Weekly Progress Reports," and the copious "Correspondence In and Out" between the client, contractor, consultants and the firm. The construction progress history is visually documented by 267 8x10" black and white photographs from 7/69 to 6/73. Fifteen metal cases of slides from the same period give researchers a picture of the development of the braced, catenary, structural system of one of the most innovative, twentieth-century buildings in the United States.</p>
          <p>Although the "Shop Drawings" are visual documents and would normally be contained in folders with the architectural drawings, they are housed here in boxes along with the textual records because they were accessioned from the firm already folded in boxes and arranged by number to correspond to trade sections within the written "Specifications." While "Shop Drawings" do not describe the firm's design process because they are issued by subcontractors in response to the "Specifications" and "Construction Documents," they may be of interest to preservationists or future owners of the building seeking to restore or renovate it. These blue-line prints document details regarding structural steel, granite, carpentry, window walls, doors, vaults, demountable partitions, HVAC, elevators, plumbing, guard consoles, interior furnishings and a myriad of other features of the building's construction.</p>
          <p>The visual documentation of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis series includes 1676 architectural, structural and mechanical/electrical drawings. Researchers interested in viewing two of the earliest conceptual drawings by Gunnar Birkerts of the Bank's structural system are encouraged to consult the Gunnar Birkerts Collection which houses conceptual sketches by the architect's own hand for most of his buildings. The finding aid for the Gunnar Birkerts Collection lists each of these conceptuals by project. The Federal Reserve Bank series within the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection does include four folders of "Site Information Documents" and "Schematic Design Drawings" associated with the first phase of the architectural design process. These are both original pencil and ink drawings on vellum and blue-line prints. Blue-line and sepia prints have been kept in this series if they are substitutes for missing originals or if they contain original annotations which contribute to our understanding of the sequence of problem solving in the evolution of the design .</p>
          <p>Those interested in the first structural drawings of the Bank from 3/68-7/68 by Skilling, Helle, Christiansen, Robertson, Consulting Structural Engineers, are referred to the "Preliminary Design Drawings" series. "Preliminary Design Architectural Drawings" also show early ideas regarding the use of the braced, catenary, structural system. Original pencil drawings on vellum and tracing paper and blue-line and sepia prints fully document the evolution of the "Design Development" process from early floor plans, elevations, sections and axonometrics of mid-1968 to more detailed print sets which were sent to the Federal Reserve System in Washington and to the contractor on 12/9/68 and 3/14/69, respectively. "Design Development Drawings" of the plaza, car ramps and building interiors are also included.</p>
          <p>The "Construction Documents" of 6/19/69 for the 11-story Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Bank include both original pencil on linen architectural and structural drawings and sepia prints of the mechanical, electrical, food service, and elevator systems, with revisions corresponding to the "Addenda" and "Bulletins" in the firm's narrative records. Preservationists and other researchers interested in the fine details of the construction process are also referred to the "Revisions and Clarifications" which document changes to the building through 1974. The entire mass of 1676 drawings in this series represents the evolution of a complex, landmark building and shows the artistry of the architect's hand on his work, before the advent of computer-aided design eliminated this important aspect of architectural documentation.</p>

          <p>The Duluth Public Library (5 linear feet, 699 drawings; 1966-1984), first designed in 1969 but not completed until 1980, attests to Mr. Birkerts' monumentality of sculptural form, innovative use of surface materials and powerful expression of metaphor in his buildings. Although progress on the project was held up intermittently by funding problems and changes in program and management, the initial concept which Mr. Birkerts envisioned in 1969 remained intact throughout the decade of design and construction. Constricted by a long, narrow site and the need to maintain a view from the adjacent, historic Depot to the Civic Center at the end of the Fifth Avenue Mall, Mr. Birkerts floated the cantilevered Library with its curved prow over a double-decker Plaza, recalling the form of a dynamic, Great Lakes ore carrier pointing westward towards the city. The structure is enclosed by 30-inch-wide steel panels finished in polyester enamel and inward-slanting windows. These diffuse light into the building through the use of a reflecting band of silver metal below, on the exterior, and sloping, white panels above, on the interior. The interior decor of the Library, with its nautical seagreen and magenta colors, was also designed by Gunnar Birkerts and Associates, as were the Fifth Avenue Mall and Plazas and the Library Plaza Improvements.</p>
          <p>The Duluth Public Library series includes five linear feet of textual records, which document in narrative form the design and construction of the building, and 699 architectural and engineering drawings, which visually show the evolution of the creative process from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences. Because the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection pairs the narrative and visual records for each building series, it offers researchers a rich opportunity to understand the program, design and construction management issues affecting each project.</p>
          <p>The textual records of the firm within the Duluth Public Library series also include materials related to the Library Interiors, the Fifth Avenue Mall and Plazas and the Library Plaza Improvements. Researchers seeking to understand Mr. Birkerts' ideas regarding the design of the Library are encouraged to read the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" and the article from Architectural Record which follows. It is interesting to compare the written 1969-1970 "Schematic Design" and 1971 "Design Development Presentation Outline Specifications" with the final 1977 "Original Specifications" which were produced six years later following a 1973-1976 "Cost Reduction Study." The three sets of written "Specifications" correspond to the "Schematic Design # 1 1/2 Presentation Drawings," "Design #2 Development Drawings" and "Construction Documents" of the same dates found in the visual records.</p>
          <p>Within the textual records of the Duluth Public Library series are narrative materials which document the history of the construction process and the management issues confronted by Gunnar Birkerts and Associates. "Memoranda #1-95" and "Correspondence In and Out" between the firm, client, contractor and consultants give a detailed picture of the day-to-day progress of the project, which is further enhanced by 80 8x10" black and white construction progress photographs, 87 31/2x5 " black and white photographs and 73 color slides. The Duluth Public Library Interiors, Fifth Avenue Mall and Plazas and Library Plaza Improvements records similarly, although more briefly, document the development of these related projects.</p>
          <p>The 699 architectural and engineering drawings which make up the visual records of the Duluth Public Library series encompass all stages of the design process. Researchers who wish to view four early conceptual drawings of the Library by Mr. Birkerts should consult the finding aid of the collateral Gunnar Birkerts Collection, listing all of the conceptual sketches by the architect's own hand for most of his projects.</p>
          <p>The drawings in the Duluth Public Library series of the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection include "Schematic Design" and "Design Development" drawings for early "Schemes #1, 1 1/2 and 2", which were presented before the 1973 "Cost Reduction Study." They were the precursors of the final "Design #3," whose "Design Development" and 1977 "Construction Documents" are also available for study. While most of the visual materials in the series are original pencil or ink drawings on vellum, tracing paper or mylar, a number of blue-line and sepia prints have been retained because they are substitutes for missing originals or they contain pencil annotations which contribute to our understanding of the design process. Representative "Curtain Wall Shop Drawings" may be of use to preservationists or future owners who want to restore or renovate the building. The "Schematic Design," "Design Development" and "Construction Documents" drawings for the Library Interiors, the Fifth Avenue Mall and Plazas and the Library Plaza Improvements are included in the series and portray the evolution of these collateral projects.</p>

          <p>The Dance Instructional Facility of the State University of New York, College at Purchase (5.5 linear feet, 466 drawings; 1969-1997), designed in 1970 and completed in 1976, is significant because it is the first building in America devoted solely to the instruction and performance of dance and because it is an integral part of a campus master plan by Edward Larrabee Barnes for the new College at Purchase. Inspired by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller's passion for the arts and his mission to create a statewide tertiary education system during the 1960s, the College at Purchase was built with funds from the 4 billion dollar State University Construction Fund and dedicated to the teaching of the fine and performing arts. Barnes developed a master plan reminiscent of Jefferson's mall at the University of Virginia and commissioned architects of national prominence to design buildings along the perimeter of his Great Court.</p>
          <p>Just as Mr. Birkerts was invited to join the illustrious company of I. M. Pei, Robert Venturi, Richard Meier, Kevin Roche and Cesar Pelli in his design of Lincoln Elementary School in Columbus, Indiana, so too at Purchase, his Dance Instructional Facility is in the company of academic buildings by such other renowned architects as Edward Larrabee Barnes, Philip Johnson/John Burgee, Paul Rudolph, Venturi and Rauch, The Architects Collaborative (Norman Fletcher), and Gwathmey, Henderson &amp; Siegel. Commenting on the contribution of Mr. Birkerts' work to the new campus in his essay "The Architecture of Good Intentions" (1997), architectural critic Paul Goldberger states: "Only one architect, Gunnar Birkerts, is represented by a work equal to his best; his dance building is an exuberant structure of glass that seems to have managed to induce more creative energy out of Barnes' design structures than anything else on the campus has done".</p>
          <p>Mr. Birkerts' uses of metaphor and innovative lighting are hallmarks of his reputation for expressive design and are pivotal to our appreciation of the Dance Instructional Facility. Inspired by Dance Department Dean William Bales' vision of dance as ideally being performed out-of-doors, the architect conceived of the building as a garden, surrounded by a high wall, within which studios are positioned like pavilions. The sloped, glass top of the wall admits light to the linear, perimeter corridors and the interior studios, which in turn have their own inclined glass windows. Thus, natural light is diffused throughout the highly engineered learning and performance spaces, giving the artists a constant orientation to the world outside. The Barnes' master plan dictated a 130-foot frontage for all of the buildings along the Grand Court, as well as uniform materials of dark brick, tinted glass and anodized aluminum. Within the confines of these guidelines, Mr. Birkerts has designed a distinctive building which ennobles the art forms of dance and architecture.</p>
          <p>The Dance Instructional Facility at Purchase series includes 5.5 linear feet of textual records, which chronologically document the program, design and construction of the building, and 466 architectural and engineering drawings, which show the evolution of the design process through the "Schematic Design," "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences. The combination of the narrative and visual records gives researchers an unusually rich picture of the evolution of this building from conception to finish and an understanding of the complex management operations of a nationally prominent architectural firm in the 1970s.</p>
          <p>Researchers wishing to gain perspective on Mr. Birkerts' design of this project are encouraged to read the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" and the three critical articles which follow. The "Site and Program Information" and "Program Notebook" include the important background information about the College at Purchase, Barnes' master plan and the dance facility requirements which were gathered by Gunnar Birkerts and Associates during the early program phase of the project. Also of note in the narrative records of the series are the "Schematic Report" of 6/29/70 and the "Design Manual Report" of 12/11/70, which summarize the solutions found during the "Schematic Design" and "Design Development" phases of the architectural process and correspond to the drawings of these periods within the visual records. Likewise, the "Project Manual Specifications" of 7/16/3 are the architect's written requirements for the building, which, along with changes described in "Addenda #1-2" and "Bulletins #1-30," relate directly to the "Construction Documents" of the same date.</p>
          <p>The textual records of the Dance Instructional Facility series also document the evolution of the design and construction of the building from 1970 to 1976 through "Memoranda #1-129", "Minutes of Job Meetings #1-59," "Project Representative's Weekly Construction Reports #1-113", and "Correspondence In and Out" between the firm, client, contractor, and consultants. The narrative records also contain 98 8x10" black and white construction progress photographs of the project from 2/74 to 1/76. In addition to the written and graphic documentation available in this series, the photographs give us a third medium for understanding the evolution of this building.</p>
          <p>The visual records of this series include early, original pencil and ink "Schematic Design" drawings on vellum and tracing paper and original "Design Development" drawings. Blue-line and sepia prints are retained when they are substitutes for missing originals or when they contain annotations which further illuminate the design evolution of the building. Researchers should note that four conceptual sketches of the Dance Instructional Facility are housed in the Gunnar Birkerts Collection, which contains early drawings of most of his buildings by the architect's own hand. The finding aid for this second, collateral collection lists all of the conceptuals available for study.</p>
          <p>Also of interest within the visual records of this series are the 10 undated, ink on vellum "Presentation Drawings" which were exhibited at the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College in 1996-1997. Original pencil on mylar "Construction Documents," with "Addenda" and "Bulletin" changes and dates noted on them, complete the visual documentation of this project. The Dance Instructional Facility and the academic buildings by other master architects which surround it on the 1970s S.U.N.Y. campus continue to hold fascination for scholars of architecture and planning.</p>

          <p>The Corning Municipal Fire Station (1.5 linear feet 202 drawings; 1973-1977), in Corning, New York was designed in 1973 and constructed in 1974. This triangular building attests to the power of metaphor in Mr. Birkerts design, as the shiny, red, metal cladding and silver, checkerplate base evoke the image of the fire engines within. The fire truck iconography is further enhanced by the placement of exterior gyrolights at each corner of the building which flash like those on the vehicle when calls come into the dispatcher. Even the rubber glazing on the windows is reminiscent of the material found on the truck's windshield. The triangular form of the Fire Station functions as a pointer on the landscape, guiding the eye in one direction across the Chemung River toward the Corning Glass manufacturing complex and in a second direction toward the Corning Glass Museum. While the three-sided design was chosen by Mr. Birkerts for its simplicity and its accommodation of the programmatic requirements within, he realized after the building was constructed that the triangle is the ancient symbol for fire. This Jungian discovery lends credence to Mr. Birkerts' belief that the unconscious is a powerful agent in the creative process.</p>
          <p>The Corning Municipal Fire Station series in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection contains 1.5 linear feet of textual records and 202 architectural and engineering drawings. The narrative records document the evolution of the design and construction of the building, and the drawings visually demonstrate the phases of the design process from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences. The pairing of the textual and visual records in this series gives researchers an unusually rich picture of all aspects of the design and construction management process.</p>
          <p>The "Architect's Conceptual Statement" contained in the narrative records is an important document to those seeking to understand his ideas about the design of the Corning Fire Station. The written "Specifications for General Contract" of 4/10/73 define all of the requirements regarding the construction of the building and correspond directly to the "Construction Documents" of the same date, which are housed with the visual materials. "Addenda #1-3" and "Bulletins #1-6" in the textual records are likewise interpreted graphically in the "Construction Documents" because all revisions and changes are drawn and dated on them. Researchers desiring a picture of the design and construction management activities undertaken by this major architectural office in the 1970s should consult "Memoranda #1-30" and "Correspondence In and Out" between the firm, client, contractor and consultants. Also available within the narrative records are samples of interior and exterior finishes, including fabrics, carpets, tiles, paints and the fire-truck-red, metal panels and silver, checker plate which make up the cladding of the building.</p>
          <p>The 202 visual documents in the Corning Municipal Fire Station series include original pencil on vellum and tracing paper "Schematic Design" drawings and original "Design Development" drawings and prints. Blue-line and sepia prints from these phases have been kept in the series when they are substitutes for missing originals or when they are annotated and therefore show changes which are important to our understanding of the design process. Researchers interested in Mr. Birkerts' earliest designs of the Fire Station are encouraged to view six conceptual drawings which are housed in the Gunnar Birkerts Collection. A finding aid for this second, collateral collection lists all of the conceptual sketches by the architect's own hand for most of his projects over his almost fifty-year career.</p>
          <p>The "Construction Documents" in this series include original architectural, mechanical and electrical pencil on mylar drawings of 4/17/73, with revisions up to 8/13/74. Of the 14 projects housed in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection, the Fire Station is the only one which offers a set of "As-Built Construction Documents." Preservationists or those interested in the restoration of the building in the future will want to view these 27 "As-Built," annotated, sepia prints. Preliminary drawings and "Construction Documents" for the Corning Well House which is adjacent to the Fire Station are also available in this series. Thus, the graphic materials document all aspects of the evolution of the Municipal Fire Station project.</p>

          <p>The Calvary Baptist Church (2 linear feet, 344 drawings; 1974-1987), in Detroit, Michigan, was designed in 1974 and completed in 1977. The strong, sculpturesque shape of the building, with its vibrant, orange, ribbed, panel cladding, attests to the monumentality and simplicity of form and innovative use of surface materials for which Mr. Birkerts is renowned. His ability to understand the personality and culture of his clients is also evident in his focus on the interior of the church, where he provides an immense, mirrored wall which faces the African American congregation and reflects its vitality and exuberance. The interactive quality of the mirror behind the linear, baptismal pool gives church members the sense that they have symbolically gathered on both sides of the Jordan River, where services were historically held. Thus, Mr. Birkerts metaphorically connects the expressive congregation with its past, while reflecting its optimism and strong, hopeful, religious conviction through this bold, vibrant building which rises from a green park adjacent to Detroit's historic Elmwood Cemetery.</p>
          <p>The Calvary Baptist Church series includes two linear feet of textual records, which chronologically document the design and construction evolution of the building, and 344 architectural and engineering drawings, which graphically illuminate the design process through the "Schematic Design," "Design Development" and "Construction Document" phases. This combination of the firm's narrative and visual records provides researchers with a broad and deep picture of the creation of this building, from the first contact with the client to post-construction consultation. Those interested in understanding not only the architect's design process but also the management and construction issues faced by a major firm in the 1970s will appreciate this pairing of the textual and visual records.</p>
          <p>Mr. Birkerts' articulate presentation of his ideas regarding the design of the Calvary Baptist Church is found in the "Architect's Conceptual Statement," located within the textual records. The narrative documentation of the project also includes the written "Specifications for General Contract" of 8/5/75 which describe the architect's requirements for the construction of the building and correspond to the visual "Construction Documents" of the same date. Researchers interested in the evolution of the building will find a record of every meeting and major design and construction decision in "Memoranda #1-141," which span the years 1973 to 1979. "Change Orders," "Field Orders" and "Correspondence In and Out" between the firm, client, contractor and consultants will further narrate the history of the Church's design and construction.</p>
          <p>The 344 architectural and engineering drawings which comprise the visual documentation of this series are arranged chronologically by design phase. The earliest "Schematic Design" drawings are both original pencil on vellum and tracing paper sketches and blue-line and sepia prints. Prints have been retained in the collection when they are substitutes for missing originals or when they are annotated and are thus illustrative of new solutions or revisions which show the flow of the design process. The "Design Development" drawings also include a combination of originals and prints, but have been kept in chronological order to maintain the integrity of this evolution.</p>
          <p>The "Construction Documents" for Calvary Baptist Church are original pencil on vellum architectural drawings of May, August and October, 1975, and show revisions through June, 1976. Structural, mechanical and electrical "Construction Drawings" by consulting engineers are both original drawings and sepia and mylar prints. Although the "First and Second Bid Sets" of working drawings are prints of the originals, they have been kept in the series because they are annotated in colored pencil and demonstrate the interaction between architect, client and consultants, as solutions were sought through the "Construction Document" phase of the project. Even voided drawings are available to researchers within the sequence of documents in a given folder because they reflect the dynamic quality of problem solving along the continuum of the architectural design process.</p>

          <p>In her article, " 'Splendor Beneath the Grass' in Michigan" in Architectural Record (March, 1982), Andrea Oppenheimer Dean states that Gunnar Birkerts' University of Michigan Law Library Addition (7 linear feet, 638 drawings; 1972-1991) "is probably the most esthetically satisfying large underground building to have penetrated American soil." Located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the 77,000-square-foot, subterranean Law Library Addition, which was designed between 1974 and 1977 and completed in 1981, has won two design awards and has been critically acclaimed in 18 national and international architectural journals. Mr. Birkerts was faced with the challenge of building an addition to the existing 1920s faux-Gothic Legal Research Building without compromising its architecture or context. After considering a number of above-ground schemes which unsatisfactorily filled the valuable open space at the southeastern corner of the Law Quadrangle, Mr. Birkerts' final solution was to sink the new structure three stories underground, thereby implementing ideas which he had developed in his Subterranean Urban Systems Study, funded by the Graham and Rackham Foundations in 1974.</p>
          <p>In the University of Michigan Law Library Addition, Mr. Birkerts demonstrates how his renowned, innovative use of daylight influences his architectural design in a dynamic way. A V-shaped, 160-foot-long light trench wraps around two sides of the old Legal Research Building, bringing daylight to all three levels of the new addition. The three floors are open balcony trays from which law students can readily view the icon Gothic building above. One slanting wall and the base of the light trough are constructed of limestone which reflects and diffuses daylight into the interior depths of the library. The mullions of the bronzed, glass, curtain wall of the trench are sheathed with yard-deep mirrors which keep out the glare of direct sun and add refracting complexity to the images of trees, sky and the Law Quad outside. A second, triangular, glass well at the southeastern corner of the building contributes more light to the student lounge and to the back of the building and esthetically perforates the open lawn space above which has been successfully preserved.</p>
          <p>The University of Michigan Law Library Addition series includes seven linear feet of narrative materials, which chronologically document the evolution of the design and construction of the building, and 638 architectural and engineering drawings, which graphically show the entire architectural process from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" phases. The pairing of written materials with the original drawings provides researchers with a complete, in-depth picture of the activities of the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates, as the firm designed and managed the construction of one of the most distinguished buildings of the twentieth century in this country.</p>
          <p>Researchers are encouraged to begin their study of the Law Library Addition by reading the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" within the narrative records and the Architectural Record and A.I.A. Journal articles which follow. These will provide an understanding of Mr. Birkerts' innovative thinking and design solutions in meeting the challenge of constructing a light-infused, underground addition to the beloved Legal Research Building. As with all of his work, the character-defining elements of the architecture often result from his creative response to programmatic problems.</p>
          <p>Also of interest to architectural historians will be the "Correspondence In" from the University of Michigan, 1974-1976, which provides insight into the dialogue among members of the Law School faculty and staff concerning the various above-ground and underground schemes. The "Project Chronology, 1974-1978," also gives an historical perspective on the presentation of above-ground "Schemes A, B, C, and D" and on the final selection of the underground concept in 1976.</p>
          <p>The "Specifications for General Contract" of 10/24/77 within the textual records spell out the architect's written requirements for the building and correspond directly to the graphic "Construction Documents." Likewise, "Addenda #1-3" revisions to the working drawings described in writing in the narrative materials can be found in visual form on the "Construction Documents." Researchers interested in the management and evolution of the construction process are encouraged to read "Memoranda #1-168," which detail every decision and meeting, and "Correspondence In and Out" between the firm, the University of Michigan, the consulting engineers and the contractor. The "Interior Design Program Notebook" and "Specifications" give a complete picture of the firm's research of departmental requirements and its attention to every interior detail of the Law Library Addition.</p>
          <p>The visual records in the University of Michigan Law Library Addition series fully document the chronological development of not only the "Final Underground Scheme" but also of the initial above-ground "Schemes A, A1, A2, B, C, and D" which were discarded. Original design drawings and sepia and blue-line prints of these early above-ground concepts, including the "Halo" and the "Across Monroe Street" Schemes, are available for viewing. Prints have been kept in this series when they are substitutes for missing originals or when they are annotated and therefore reflect revisions or solutions during the design process. Original ink on vellum "Presentation Drawings" of the schemes also document the early design history of the Law Library Addition.</p>
          <p>Researchers interested in viewing the earliest four conceptual drawings of the "Final Underground Scheme" by Mr. Birkerts are referred to the Gunnar Birkerts Collection, which houses conceptuals by the architects' own hand for most of his buildings. The finding aid for this second, collateral collection describes these valuable sketches, representing in many cases the moment of conception of Mr. Birkerts' projects.</p>
          <p>The "Construction Documents" for the underground Law Library Addition in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection include original pencil on mylar architectural drawings, which graphically correspond to the written "Specifications" of 10/24/77 and are revised through 9/28/82. Structural, mechanical, electrical, interiors and construction coordination drawings complete the set of "Construction Documents" in this series. A folder of "Shop Drawings", which contains plans, elevations, sections and details for the window walls of the north and south light wells, may additionally be of interest to the University of Michigan if restoration of the building is ever contemplated.</p>

          <p>The Corning Museum of Glass (4 linear feet, 474 drawings; 1972-1988) in Corning, New York, was conceived in 1976, following Mr. Birkerts' stimulating and productive experience as Architect in Residence at the American Academy in Rome. Since 1972, he had worked on an exploratory concept for the New Glass Center at Corning, incorporating external and internal people-moving transportation systems into his attenuated building design. However, in 1976, he developed a bold, new, expressive vision for the Museum, which was inspired and supported by Thomas S. Buechner, the president and director of the Corning Museum of Glass. Testifying to Mr. Birkerts' gift as a maker of powerful and often metaphorical forms, this building encompasses seven interior galleries laid out on an orthogonal grid within its flowing, amorphous exterior walls, clad in stainless steel-backed panels of patterned glass. Thus, the architect juxtaposes the irregular form of molten glass on the outside of the building with the organized structure of frozen glass crystals on the inside.</p>
          <p>Just as the undulating shape and innovative use of luminous surface materials make the Museum of Glass one of the significant modern buildings of the twentieth century, so too the "linear periscope" window which winds around the exterior wall is a major character-defining feature and gives distinction to the project. With 45-degree, angled mirrors above and below, the continuous, ribbon window shields the interior galleries from direct sun and its associated heat, while at the same time connecting the viewer with direct images of the glass manufacturing plant in the distance. This innovative, kaleidoscopic lighting is at once energy-efficient and aesthetically pleasing. The seven exhibit galleries and library of the Museum are hefted on concrete columns one story above the flood plane of the Chemung River, while the administrative offices and mechanical equipment are housed on the recessed first floor. The exhibit space offers four layers of investigation by museum-goers. The Grand Hall with its twelve "masterpiece columns," containing glass artifacts of great artistic and technological achievement, gives way to the seven galleries representing historic periods of glass-making over 3500 years. As one moves through the galleries toward the perimeter of the building, the number and density of exhibited objects increases, with a total of 19,177 on display altogether.</p>
          <p>The Corning Museum of Glass series of the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection includes four linear feet of textual records, which document in writing the design and construction of the building, and 474 drawings, which graphically represent the evolution of the architectural design process from "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" phases. The pairing of the narrative with the visual records gives scholars an unusually rich, multi-dimensional picture of the design and construction management activities of a major architectural firm in the last half of the twentieth century. Design students, architectural historians, preservationists and other researchers will appreciate the depth and breadth of documentation for this and other buildings in this collection in the days just before the advent of computer-aided design, when design development and working drawings alike were still being created by the hand of the architect.</p>
          <p>Researchers may wish to begin their study of this building by reading the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" and the article from Architectural Record which follows within the narrative records. These materials will enrich their understanding of the program and Mr. Birkerts' innovative solutions which drove the design process for the Corning Museum of Glass. "Memoranda," "Correspondence" and "Cost Estimates" from 1972 to 1975 describe the evolution of the New Glass Center (Museum of Glass I), the earlier unbuilt project which explored human transportation systems to and within the building. The "Original Specifications" of 4/3/78 for the Corning Museum of Glass II spell out in writing the firm's requirements for the construction of the building and correspond directly to the visual "Construction Documents" of the same date. "Addenda # 1 and 2," which amend the "Specifications", describe in writing changes made to the contract documents and include 164 small 81/2x11" original drawings and prints representing these revisions.</p>
          <p>The narrative records in the Museum of Glass series also include "Bulletins #1-7," "Memoranda #1-117," and "Correspondence In and Out" between the firm, client, contractor and consulting engineers, which chronologically describe every decision and meeting relating to the construction of the building from the beginning of the design process in 1976 to the end of construction in 1980. Of particular note is a folder containing samples of exterior and interior finishes, laminates, paints, fabrics and tiles, including a small panel of the innovative, stainless-steel-backed, patterned glass with which the building is clad. Also housed in this series are the firm's narrative documents pertaining to Corning Glass Works' collateral projects, including the renovation of the existing Corning Glass Center and the development of a master plan for the site.</p>
          <p>The 474 architectural and engineering drawings in the Corning Museum of Glass series are chronologically arranged by design phase. Researchers interested in viewing 13 conceptual drawings and cut-out representations of the Corning Museum of Glass I and II are directed to the Gunnar Birkerts Collection, which amasses all of the conceptuals by the architect's own hand for most of his buildings. Please consult the finding aid for this second collection which lists all of these valuable drawings, representing in many cases the moment of conception of Mr. Birkerts' projects.</p>
          <p>The Corning Museum of Glass series within the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection contains "Schematic Design Sketches," "Presentation Drawings" and "Design Development Drawings" as well as "Preliminary Drawings" by Paul H. Seiz Associates, Exhibit Designer. These include original pencil and ink drawings on tracing paper and vellum as well as colored marker drawings on blue-line and sepia prints. Prints have been kept in this collection when they are substitutes for missing originals or when they contain annotations which contribute to our understanding of the evolution of the design process. Architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical "Construction Documents" show revisions through 12/78, and "Shop Drawings" on blue-line prints by Flour City Architectural Metals include elevations and details of the innovative window wall and skylight systems of the Museum. These may be of significance if renovation of the building is ever contemplated in the future.</p>

          <p>In his "Architect's Conceptual Statement" regarding his Ferguson Residence ("Villa Ginny") (0.5 linear feet, 155 drawings; 1980-1989), in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Mr. Birkerts states that the building is an "organic expression" of the dramatic, natural beauty of the two ravines which traverse the wooded site. He describes the organic design of this house in 1980 as a significant turning point in his career, "a newly found freedom facet for me within the many faceted movement of Modern Architecture." Appearing as if it has naturally grown from the ravine, the building juxtaposes a fluid exterior wall, which mimics the contours of the landscape, with the orthogonal organization of its inner core, which houses the functional services of the residence but does not touch the perimeter walls. There is a further balance between the organic, exterior cladding of teak, copper and stucco and the high-technology interior, with its angular, white, plastered walls. This house offers a private, serene retreat with natural views on six sides to clients Robert and Virginia Ferguson, with whose programmatic needs and values Mr. Birkerts strongly related.</p>
          <p>The Ferguson Residence series contains .5 linear foot of textual records, which document the design and construction of the building, and 155 architectural and engineering drawings, which graphically record the evolution of the creative design process from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences. The pairing of the narrative and visual records offers architectural historians, design students, preservationists and other scholars a broad and deep perspective on the development of the building, from its initial conception to its completion and its securing of a place in history.</p>
          <p>Researchers wishing to understand the ideas which inspired Mr. Birkerts' design of the building are referred to the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" and his poem entitled "Villa Ginny" within the textual records of the series. The requirements of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates regarding the construction of the house are written in the "Specifications" of 10/16/81. These and narrative "Bulletins #1-4" correspond directly to the visual "Construction Documents" of 12/22/81 contained within the visual materials. "Memoranda #1-38" and "Correspondence In and Out" document meetings, decisions, revisions and other construction business for those interested in the interaction of the firm with the clients, contractor and consulting engineers. Finally, narrative materials relating to the interior design and furnishings of the building are of value in showing the mastery of design of both the inside as well as the outside of the Ferguson Residence.</p>
          <p>The 155 drawings which comprise the visual records in this series are arranged chronologically by design. Although some later original "Schematic Design" drawings may be found here, the earliest conceptual sketches of the Ferguson Residence are contained separately in the Gunnar Birkerts Collection. Researchers interested in viewing 19 of these conceptuals, showing the metamorphosis of the initial design, are encouraged to consult the finding aid for this second collection, which amasses sketches by the architect's own hand for most of his projects.</p>
          <p>The "Design Development" documents of this series in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection are mostly original pencil or ink drawings on tracing paper, vellum and mylar. However, some blue-line and sepia prints have been kept in this series if they are substitutes for originals or if they are annotated and therefore help to show the evolution of the architectural design process. The "Design Development Presentation Drawings" are of special interest. These ten ink on vellum drawings artistically depict the site and floor plans, elevations and sections of this beautiful, organic building. The "Construction Documents" include the working architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical drawings of 12/22/81, revised through 5/24/82, as well as "Supplementary Construction Details."</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>St. Peter's Lutheran Church (3 linear feet, 997 drawings; 1981-1988), designed in 1981, redesigned in 1985-86 and completed in 1988, is located in Columbus, Indiana, across the street from Lincoln Elementary School (1967), which is also included in the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection. Columbus, Indiana, is nationally known for its collection of 25 school and civic buildings designed under the auspices of the Cummins Engine Foundation by such other masters of modern architecture as I. M. Pei, Robert Venturi, Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo, Edward Larrabee Barnes and Richard Meier. St. Peter's Lutheran Church was privately commissioned by the congregation which had been impressed by Mr. Birkerts' architectural solutions in his design of Lincoln Elementary School and desired a building of similar materials and sensitivity to its Fifth Street context.</p>
          <p>With its modern, rounded brick and concrete form juxtaposed with a 115-foot copper-sheathed spire which pays homage to early Nordic Lutheran traditions, St. Peter's celebrates the duality of opposites which occur in nature and in life. Mr. Birkerts' hallmark fascination with organic dichotomy is expressed in the intersection of curvilinear and orthogonal geometries, the contrast of symmetry and asymmetry, and the tension of building materials in this architectural masterpiece. Seating space for 1000 members of the congregation is arranged in rising levels of concentric, but irregular circles which engender a feeling of intimacy and inclusiveness within the awe-inspiring space of the nave. Although the altar cross is located on-axis with the center aisle, its left arm projects beyond the sanctuary wall, further emphasizing the organic asymmetry of the design. Mr. Birkerts' signature use of indirect daylight in his architecture is also evident here in the placement of fin walls to allow north light into the altar space. A monumental 12-foot-wide chandelier mimics the circle-within-a-circle geometry of the nave and leads the eye upward into the conical spire.</p>
          <p>The St. Peter's Lutheran Church series within the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection includes three linear feet of textual records, which describe the design and construction of the building, and 997 architectural drawings, which illuminate the creative process from the "Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences. This combination of the narrative and visual records offers design students, architectural historians and other scholars an unusually broad and deep perspective on the design and business activities of an internationally prominent architectural firm at the end of the twentieth century. Furthermore, these drawings represent some of the last hand-produced design and construction documents of this era, as computer-aided design begins to dominate the work of architectural firms across the nation.</p>
          <p>Researchers interested in understanding Mr. Birkerts thoughts and ideas relating the his design of St. Peter's Lutheran Church are directed to the "Architect's Conceptual Statement" within the textual records. Further critical illumination of his work is provided through two articles from Faith and Form and Interiors which follow. The narrative records also include the written "Specifications" for both the "Unbuilt (6/24/85) and Built (4/21/86) Schemes," which document the changes made when construction bids for the first design were deemed to be too high. At this juncture, Mr. Birkerts worked with the congregation to redesign the roof from a flatter shape with fan-shaped planes to the final conical form. Although the second scheme was not as satisfying to the architect, he views the change as a part of the natural evolution of design which occurs when all subjective and objective factors are considered. The two sets of "Specifications," representing the firm's requirements for the construction of the building, are the written counterpart to the "Construction Documents" of the same dates, which impart the identical information in visual form.</p>
          <p>The narrative records of the St. Peter's Lutheran Church series are arranged chronologically and include "Program Analyses" and "Cost Estimates" from the "Schematic Design" and "Design Development" phases of the architectural process, as well as "Field Reports," "Bulletins" and "Change Orders" from the construction stage. "Memoranda # 1-116" document in writing all decisions and actions taken by Gunnar Birkerts and Associates from 1981 through 1988 and thus provide a narrative history of the design and construction of this building. "Correspondence In and Out" between the firm and the client, consulting engineers and contractor also offers rich documentation of the project. Finally, 250 color 4x6" photographic prints of the construction progress are housed within the narrative records and graphically depict the building process.</p>
          <p>The 997 visual documents in this series are arranged chronologically according to architectural phase, from the" Schematic Design" through the "Design Development" and "Construction Document" sequences for both the "Unbuilt and Built Schemes." Researchers interested in viewing 85 original, conceptual drawings of St. Peter's Lutheran Church by Gunnar Birkerts are encouraged to consult the finding aid for the Gunnar Birkerts Collection, which houses early sketches for most of his buildings by the architect's own hand. This important, second collection contains 11 conceptual sketches of the Church and 74 sketches of the interior millwork, representing the design of the "Eternal Flame, Door, Pews" and other features constructed in maple.</p>
          <p>The visual documents in the St. Peter's Lutheran Church series within the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection include original pencil "Schematic Design" and "Design Development" drawings on tracing paper and vellum as well as some blue-line and sepia prints. Prints have been retained in this collection when they are substitutes for missing, original drawings or when they contain pencil annotations which show the evolution of the design process. Even drawings and prints on which the word "void" is written have been kept in chronological sequence in folders because they show the ongoing search for solutions to problems which is part of architectural design. The "Construction Documents for Unbuilt Scheme I" (6/24/85) are annotated blue-line prints and include structural, mechanical and electrical drawings of the consulting engineers.</p>
          <p>The chronological arrangement of the drawings in this series tells the story of the redesign of the roof after the first "Construction Documents" and "Specifications" were issued on 6/24/85, resulting in contractors' bids which were considered to be too high. Folders 27-34 contain "Design Development" drawings which represent the search for more economical solutions, culminating in "Built Scheme II." The architectural and structural "Construction Documents" for the final scheme (4/21/86) include electrostatic prints on mylar with colored pencil annotations and sepia prints, all of which are revised through 10/87. Recognizing that the interior design emphasizes the Scandinavian juxtaposition of white walls with rich maple woodwork, researchers may also be interested in the millwork construction drawings for the "Pulpit, Lectern, Baptismal Font, Curved Pews, Modesty Screen, Communion Rail, Cross, Gethsemane Window Enclosure, Eternal Flame" and other important features.</p>

          <p>A 2008 addendum to the collection includes records and drawings associated with 74 more projects of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates, encompassing an additional 3,000 drawings and 13 linear feet of textual materials and photographs. Unlike the 14 buildings in the original collection, which are documented from the beginning of the design process to the end, this second accession of projects includes only original, ink-on-vellum, presentation drawings and/or construction photographs for 53 of the 74 buildings. However, the beauty and clarity of these visual materials enrich our appreciation for the evolution, breadth and genius of Birkerts' work over fifty years.</p>

          <p>The textual records associated with the above twenty-one projects are comprised of Birkerts' conceptual statements about each, written specifications, and memoranda and bulletins, which describe the construction process. The documentation of these buildings is further enriched by visual materials, including construction photographs and slides and contract drawings. In addition to the working drawings, schematic design, design development and presentation drawings are also available for a few of them. The seventy-four projects in this series are described in alphabetical order in the finding aid.</p>
          <p>The "Additional Projects" series also contains the drawings of a few projects by Eero Saarinen's and Minoru Yamasaki's firms, both of which employed Gunnar Birkerts as a young architect in the 1950s. Mr. Birkerts included these materials in his donation to the Bentley Library. These construction drawings are all prints of originals and document projects completed by the Saarinen and Yamasaki while Birkerts received training in their firms. Three buildings by Eeero Saarinen and Associates and nine buildings by Yamasaki are included in this collection.</p>

          <p>The series contains 7,840 color 35 mm slides in 5 boxes. Many of these photographs were taken of conceptual and presentation drawings and models, as well as of the construction process and completed buildings. Pairing the architectural drawings with the photographs in this series will further broaden the researcher's understanding of each project, all of which are arranged alphabetically by building in the finding aid. Researchers will note that many of the original photographs were taken by the renowned, Michigan, architectural photographer, Balthazar Korab, whose stamp is evident on the slides. Gunnar Birkerts and Balthazar Korab were very good friends, having met while working side-by-side in Eero Saarinen's architectural firm in the 1950s.</p>

        <p>Researchers are encouraged to consult a second, collateral collection which will further enhance their study of Birkerts' work and career. Whereas the Gunnar Birkerts and Associates Collection houses all of the firm's drawings and records associated with 14 of Mr. Birkerts' buildings, as well as selected drawings of 74 additional projects, the Gunnar Birkerts Collection contains only drawings by the architect's own hand, many of which are valuable, early conceptual sketches of most of his works. The electronic images of 282 sketches of 58 of the buildings can also be seen online in the Bentley Historical Library Image Bank at: <title render="italic" linktype="simple" href="http://bentley.umich.edu/legacy-support/birkerts.php" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Gunnar Birkerts, Conceptual Drawings</title>. The <title render="italic" linktype="simple" href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-02103" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Gunnar Birkets papers</title> houses slides of many of his buildings, videotapes of his lectures and interviews, and extensive, personal, project files. This second collection adds an insightful perspective on the architect himself, illuminating his views on the creative process and the resulting conceptual designs, which have defined his expressive architecture over his illustrious fifty-year career. The Gunnar Birkerts Collection is the architect's deeply personal legacy. He himself has recognized that his buildings may be demolished over time, but his original, conceptual designs on paper can be conserved for future generations to study and enjoy. To this end, he has endowed the Gunnar Birkerts Collection to ensure that his own drawings will be preserved and that his place in architectural history will be understood.</p>
