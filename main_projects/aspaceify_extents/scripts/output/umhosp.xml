      <abstract>The University of Michigan Hospital system has evolved and expanded since its inception in 1869. The various hospitals, such as the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, provide medical treatment to the Ann Arbor, Michigan area. The Hospitals records contain five series: Hospital Administration, Nursing, Committees/Councils, Patient Files, and Hospital Buildings. This collection includes meeting minutes, patient files, director files, correspondence, and more.</abstract>

        <emph render="bold">Name Changes in Hospital Administration</emph>
      </p>
      <p>During the early years of the University Hospital operation (1869-1874), the institution was entrusted to the care of janitors and matrons. In 1874, a house physician was placed in charge, beginning a series of different titles, ranging from steward, to superintendent and later, director. The list of early overseers is sketchy.</p>
      <p>The University Hospital Board in Control was replaced by the University Hospital Executive Board in 1974.</p>
      <p>In 1978, the Board of Clinical Directors was superseded by the Nursing Executive Committee</p>
      <p>In 1982 the Planning Advisory Committee became the Public Advisory Board.</p>
      <p>The Replacement Hospital Project was dissolved in June 1984 with the formation of the Vice Provost Advisory Board, under the administration of the Vice Provost for Medical Affairs.</p>
      <p>In January 1989 the Hospital Executive Team became the Hospital Advisory Group.</p>
      <p>In 1997 the U-M Board of regents approves "University of Michigan Health System" encompassing the Hospitals and Health Centers, Medical School, M-Care, and Michigan Health Corp.</p>
      <p>The School of Nursing becomes a part of the University of Michigan Health System in 2008. All of the hospitals and many of the clinical units are transitioned into a computerized order entry system called UM-CareLink.</p>

          <p>The Hospital Administration series (66 linear feet) contains the records of various directors of the University of Michigan Hospitals, as well as the executive boards and councils. This series is broken up into 8 subseries, each one focusing on a different administrator or committee. Included amongst the administrators are some of the directors, executive directors, associate directors, and assistant directors.</p>
          <p>The Dalston, Jeptha W. subseries (1 linear foot) contains documentation from Dalston's time as the executive director of the hospital system, from 1975 to 1985. This subseries contains a volume of Dalston's correspondence. More records relating to Dalston can be found within the subseries of his successor, John Forsyth.</p>
          <p>The Executive Director's Council subseries (4 linear feet) contain records from the Executive Director's Advisory Council, as well as the similar Executive Director's Council. Included within this subseries are mainly the meeting minutes of these administrative councils as well as other project files. This subseries contains records from 1980 to 1995 and is arranged chronologically.</p>
          <p>The Forsyth, John subseries (29 linear feet) makes up a bulk of the Hospital Administration series. These materials contain records from Forsyth's time as the Executive Director of the Hospitals, between the years 1985 and 1996. This subseries documents the full range of activities in which hospital executives participated in the 1980s and 1990s, including affiliations, negations, and merger talks with other local hospitals as well as with the University of Michigan Medical School, relations with the state of Michigan, the development of a health maintenance organization (HMO), and financial and strategic planning for a major medical institution. Records relating to hospital departments contain some annual reports as well as full-scale reviews of the departmental programs. Some of the materials in this subseries also contain documentation of some of projects and actions performed by Forsyth's predecessor, Dalston.</p>
          <p>The Haynes, Harley subseries (4 linear feet) consists of records relating to the actions of the Hospital Director (precursor to the role of executive director) from 1924 to 1945. This subseries is completely comprised of director's correspondence, which is arranged alphabetically by topic.</p>
          <p>The Howe, Arlene subseries (3 linear feet) contains material from 1973 to 1978, in which she spent time as the Assistant Director of the Hospitals. Topical files are contained within the subseries, and are arranged alphabetically. They include information on the various projects that Howe took part in, many of them concerning the construction of some of the hospital buildings. There are also committee meeting minutes that Howe was involved with, documenting building renovations and space allocation.</p>
          <p>The University Hospitals Executive Board (17 linear feet) subseries consist of materials from the Executive Board, along with related administrative committees including the Executives Council, Executive Staff, Board in Control, and Executive Board. The materials range from 1919 to 1996 and mostly made up of the minutes from these board meetings and executive directories.</p>
          <p>The Warren, Larry subseries (3 linear feet) covers the years 1996 to 2006 during his time as the Executive Director of the Hospitals. The subseries is primarily made up of videotapes from the Executive Director's Forum as well as volumes of Warren's correspondence.</p>
          <p>The Zugich, John subseries (5 linear feet) consists of the topical files of the Associate Director of the Hospitals during the mid-1970s. Materials include records of hospital projects, including surveys and studies, which Zugich took part in. This subseries is arranged alphabetically.</p>

          <p>The Committees/Councils series (37 linear feet) contains materials on a number of committees of on the different functions within the many hospitals. The series is split into 10 subseries, each one offering documentation on the decisions and actions of specific committees. Each of the subseries solely contains minutes of the committee meetings, except in the case of the Medical Staff subseries which also consists of data and statistics compiled by this group. Records relating to the committees of the executive directors and executive board can be found in the Hospital Administration series.</p>
