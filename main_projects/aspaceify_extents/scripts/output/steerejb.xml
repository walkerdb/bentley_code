    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Joseph Beal Steere was born February 9, 1842, in a house on Bean Creek, in the township of Rollin, Lenawee County, Michigan. His parents, William Millhouse Steere and Elizabeth Cleghorn Steere (nee Beal), were of pioneer Quaker stock. Both had brief careers as teachers before they married and turned to farming. In 1848 the Steere family moved by railroad and canal to Covington, Kentucky, on account of the father's poor health. In 1849 they moved again, to a spot twelve miles from Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>After the entire family recovered from a bout with typhoid the next year, the Steeres returned to Michigan by wagon. In 1851, when Joseph was nine years old, he was sent to live with his uncle, to work to earn his keep.</p>
      <p>In 1853 the Steeres moved to the "Miner Settlement" in Bloomer Center, Montcalm County. Steere recalled that school became important to him at this time. He had always enjoyed reading, but now he began to push himself to excel.</p>
      <p>In 1858 Dr. George Pray, one of the earliest graduates from the University of Michigan, moved to a farm not far from the Steere home. Pray made a generous offer to prepare any interested student for college. Joseph Steere took up his offer, and he began to study with Dr. Pray on a weekly basis.</p>
      <p>Steere was nineteen when the Civil War broke out. He wanted to enlist, but he was unable to, in part because of his father's opposition. So he remained at home and studied and taught school.</p>
      <p>During the Civil War Steere moved to Ann Arbor, where he lived with Dr. Pray. Believing that he needed further formal education, Steere obtained permission to attend Ann Arbor High School. While two of his brothers did ultimately fight for the Union, Steere's enthusiasm to participate was tempered by his desire to receive an education. He never did enlist.</p>
      <p>While in Ann Arbor, Steere became acquainted with the town's first botanist, Miss Mary Clark, who ran a girls' school. Steere had been interested in the workings of the natural world since childhood, but it is possible that his friendship with Miss Clark was instrumental in directing him toward a career in natural history.</p>
      <p>After Steere was graduated from high school, he worked on his father's farm until he passed the University of Michigan entrance exam. He began his college education in September, 1864. Although he had become interested in natural history, he entered the University of Michigan Law School in 1868. He earned his degree two years later.</p>
      <p>He did not practice law. Instead he embarked on an extensive world tour to gather collections for the University of Michigan Museum. His mother's cousin, Rice A. Beal--owner and publisher of the Ann Arbor Courier--agreed to pay for the expedition if Steere would write letters from his journey to be published in the Courier. Steere's travels lasted more than four years, taking him across the Andes (by horse and by foot) into Peru, and then east to China, Formosa (Taiwan), the Philippines, the Malaccas, and the Dutch Moluccas.</p>
      <p>Steere shipped home thousands of specimens of birds, reptiles, mammals, and plants. On the Island of Marajo he excavated huge prehistoric burial mounds. He obtained rare manuscripts from Formosa, and he studied fifteen previously unknown tribes along the Amazon. He was especially interested in native dialects, and he compiled phonetic studies of several different languages.</p>
      <p>His work in the Philippines was particularly notable. Many of the islands he visited had never been scientifically studied. He added at least sixty species of birds to the known Philippine avifauna, and he did extensive work on the distribution of animals throughout the archipelago.</p>
      <p>In 1875, when Steere reached Singapore, he received word that he had received the University of Michigan's first honorary doctorate, in recognition of his scientific achievements. At the same time he was made an Assistant Professor.</p>
      <p>The following year the Regents appointed Steere Assistant Professor of Paleontology and Curator of the Museum to which he had donated his collection. This was the first such museum to be built on the campus of a state university, and, consequently, a large variety of contributions began to pour into the new museum, including the Chinese collection that had been exhibited at the World's Industrial Fair, 1884-1885, in New Orleans. (In April of 1876, shortly after assuming his new responsibilities at the University of Michigan, Steere had spent some time in the British Museum collecting and perfecting data for his own collections.)</p>
      <p>In 1879 Steere became a full Professor of Zoology and Paleontology. During that year he returned to the Amazon with a party of male university students. In the space of three months they collected over a thousand specimens of birds, mammals, reptiles, and fish.</p>
      <p>In 1887 Steere requested a year's leave of absence, and again leading a party of five younger men, he returned to the Philippines. Three years later he went back to the Amazon, this time under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. He studied the Hypurinas, Jamadi, and Paumari Indians.</p>
      <p>Steere resigned from the University in 1894. He had been asked to resign by the Regents, possibly, as he maintained, because his outspoken stance on temperance had angered the local German community.</p>
      <p>After retiring, Steere spent the rest of his life on his farm near Ypsilanti. In 1901, however, he was again in the Amazon region, collecting for the Smithsonian's exhibition for the International Exposition in Buffalo. He continued to take an interest in scientific trends, and he carried on correspondence with his former colleagues and with people working for Prohibition.</p>
      <p>Steere was an intensely religious man. He was active in the Methodist Sunday School and in the temperance movement. He sided with the Darwinists in the great nineteenth century debate over evolution versus creationism, but he was a strong proponent of what he called "argument from design." He believed that the natural world provided ample proof of the existence of a Designer, for he felt that life was too meticulously formed and intricately linked to be merely the result of fortuitous and random accidents.</p>
      <p>Steere's later writings reflect his thoughts on religion, philosophy, and evolution. He began an autobiography when he was 89 years old, a work that showed a fine memory for detail, particularly details from his childhood years. He wrote some verse and numerous moralistic children's stories--many of them with animals living in authentic woodland settings.</p>
      <p>Steere married Helen Buzzard on September 30, 1879. Before their marriage she had been the principal of the first ward school of Ann Arbor. The couple had five daughters and four sons.</p>
      <p>Steere died on December 7, 1940. He was ninety-eight years old. Accolades for his lifetime accomplishments came from, among others, the University of Michigan, from the community of natural sciences, and from the Philippine National Council.</p>

          <p>The Autobiography/Biography series includes an autobiography of some fifty pages, covering Steere's childhood to his early college days. The autobiography is rich in detail for the early part of Steere's life, giving a vivid account of rural life in the 1840's-1850's. Steere's description of his college career is less complete, but correspondence from family and friends helps to fill in the picture of his life in the 1860's helps to fill in gaps in Steere's later life, especially during his working years. Also included is a folder of "general" material, one on "Affiliations," documenting the clubs and societies that Steere was affiliated with, and a folder of "Newspaper Clippings," which perhaps provides the best information about the chronology of Steere's life.</p>

          <p>The Professional and Published Correspondence series consists of the correspondence received from the transfer of Steere papers from the University of Michigan Museums Library. These letters are charming and vibrant. In fact, they are more informative than his travel diaries. The series consists of two subseries representing a 1973 accession from the U-M University Museums Library and materials received from Mary Louise Steere (1973) and Betty Steere Abercombie (1990).</p>

          <p>The last series - Correspondence with family and friends (1861-1926) - was received in 1990 and consists in part of letters received by Steere from his brothers and his friends during the period of the Civil War, from his Grandfather Beal, from his parents and his younger brothers and sisters on the family farm in Michigan, from Dr. Pray--with whom he lived for a while when he was a student at the University of Michigan--and from his classmate J.B. Davis. There are also numerous letters from Rice Beal, editor of the Ann Arbor Courier, who financed his first expedition.</p>
          <p>The letters in this series reflect Steere's growing interest in research in the field of zoology, his extended journeys to hunt for specimens for the University of Michigan and for the Smithsonian collections, his defense of Darwin, his lively defense of Prohibition, and his dismissal from the University--partly as a result of his desire to enforce Prohibition in the Ann Arbor area (within five miles of the campus).</p>
          <p>Letters from his children reflect educational procedures at the turn of the century, the children's experiences in Alaska, in Newfoundland, and in Germany during the 1920's, and an account of life as a teacher at a girls' correctional institution in Adrian, Michigan. Steere's sister Ellen's diary written while she lived in the "Old People's Home" in Chelsea, Michigan, from 1919 to 1922 describes in some detail life in an institution of this kind.</p>
          <p>Researchers on the sciences, especially those interested in natural history, would find Steere's writings pertinent. His work on Formosa (Taiwan), the Amazon region, and the Philippines would be of value, too, both as natural history and as ethnology--the westerner making use of artifacts and observing customs of "primitive" peoples. Steere was able to interpret his findings in ways that would fit his religious and intellectual framework. In an age when travel to exotic lands was both arduous and hazardous, Steere's journeys rank as sheer adventure.</p>
          <p>Finally, Steere's correspondence during his long life provides the reader with a window on a lively, articulate family and their friends, from Michigan farms to the campus of a major university--and to far-flung points of interest to them in Europe, in South America, and in Asia.</p>
