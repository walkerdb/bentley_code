      <p>In 1947, a War Memorial Committee appointed by the Regents of the university and chaired by Dean of Students, Erich A. Walter, launched a mission to gather ideas and suggestions from prominent individuals around the world for a living memorial to the 583 students and faculty who lost their lives in World War II. On May 1, 1948, the Regents approved the recommendation of the committee for a research center that would become a "comprehensive, non-classified, university-wide program of study of the peaceful applications and implications of atomic energy, as it affects society, education, industry, technology, and the whole body of scientific knowledge." (Box 4, Background Material, "The Phoenix Associates of the University of Michigan.") The program was given a name that evoked powerful symbols of hope and new life arising from the ashes of war. Within ten years, the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project was foremost among educational institutions of the world in exploring and developing peaceful uses of the atom.</p>
      <p>The official beginning of a "chain reaction" appeal to Michigan alumni to raise funds for the research center was on October 2, 1950. Signaling the opening was a full day and evening of meetings and rallies held in cities and towns around the world "linked by telephone broadcast." "Using the Atom to Strengthen America" was the theme of this first Atom Day. Atom Day subsequently became an annual tradition and a vehicle for bringing together prominent speakers and dignitaries to report to the public and industry on activities of the program.</p>
      <p>The original fund-raising campaign was highly structured, well organized, and infused from the start with the energy and the commitment of a broad base of Michigan alumni nationwide. Fourteen national regional committees were established with Chester H. Lang at the head as National Executive Chairman and university president Alexander Ruthven actively participating. In the first ten years, 30,000 individuals and 350 commercial firms contributed a total of $8 million to support the project. Also in its first decade, the project sponsored 185 research investigations by faculty members in fifteen of the university's seventeen schools and colleges. From these studies, more than 400 technical publications were published. A key factor in the success of the project was the broad participation encouraged across campus, an aspect promoted and maintained from the start under the leadership of physicist and dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, Ralph A. Sawyer, the first director of the project.</p>
      <p>As early as 1951, substantial research was under way in the study of food preservation, the preservation of metal surfaces, and age determination of pre-historic organic materials. It wasn't long before the Phoenix Project began to play an exemplary role at the university in atomic law, atomic medicine, and radiochemistry. In 1952, the Survey Research Center began a study on the impact of atomic energy on the American public, the law school began a broad investigation of the legal implications of the Atomic Energy Act, and a memorial fund for cancer research was created in honor of Alice Crocker Lloyd, former dean of women. In subsequent years, investigations expanded to scores of disciplines ranging from anthropology to zoology.</p>
      <p>A 1952 annual report noted that financial goals were reached and surpassed and that construction on a building would begin the following year. It would house facilities for safe handling and storage of high-level radiation sources containing laboratories for work in radiochemistry, engineering, botany, the health sciences, physics, and other fields. In 1955 bids were opened for a nuclear reactor to be built in a special unit at the north end of the Phoenix Laboratory funded through a $1 million Ford Motor Company donation. The reactor, the first ever requested for construction by an agency other than the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and one of the most powerful sources of nuclear fission outside the facilities of AEC, was dedicated on Atom Day in 1956. By 1957, the program included seven laboratories for atomic research built or equipped with Phoenix funds: Phoenix Memorial Laboratory, Ford Nuclear Reactor, Alice Crocker Lloyd Radiation Center, Alice Lloyd Memorial Center, Phoenix Radioisotope Laboratory, Plant Nutrition Laboratory, and Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory.</p>
      <p>In 1957, the Regents provided authorization for seeking $2 million in undesignated funds to be used for continuation of what had become the largest academic teaching and training program in the world in the field of nuclear research. Equipment and research had usurped most of the original $8 million, and discussions were inaugurated for a second campaign, geared toward implementing a five-year plan, this time in collaboration with the Development Council. (One of the early derivatives of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project campaign was the establishment of an ongoing fund-raising organization for the university. Early in 1951, the project's National Executive Committee submitted a resolution to the Board of Regents recommending such a unit, and in May of 1952, the Development Council was formally organized. Campaign efforts were thereafter designed collaboratively.)</p>
      <p>The project garnered national and international attention as funds supporting research led to fundamental scientific discoveries, most notably Donald Glaser's development of the liquid bubble chamber, which makes possible rapid, easily interpreted photographs of rare atomic interactions. Dr. Glaser, who received the Nobel Prize in 1960, conducted his original research under the auspices and with the financial support of the Phoenix Project after other agencies had rejected his idea. Glaser, by then professor of physics at the University of California, returned to Ann Arbor in 1961 to give the first Phoenix-sponsored Dewey F. Fagerburg Memorial Lecture, a venue designed to feature distinguished contributors in the nuclear energy field. The following year, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer was invited to the podium, speaking before one of the largest audiences ever in attendance at Rackham Lecture Hall.</p>
      <p>Over the years, the laboratories were visited by hundreds of scientists, individuals, and government officials. In 1955, University of Michigan scientists participated considerably at the International Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva. Worldwide interest in these issues led to the founding of the International Cooperation Administration (ICA), an arm of the AEC. Under a contract with ICA, Phoenix became the primary consulting agency for providing expert advice to foreign countries initiating atomic energy programs.</p>
      <p>From the mid-1960s, the Phoenix Project and its associated facilities were overseen by a director reporting to the university's vice president for research and an executive committee composed of faculty members from across campus. Faculty executive committee responsibilities included budgeting and long-term planning. The committee was charged with relating the work of Phoenix to the university's instruction and research programs. By 1996, the number of research projects funded and completed had reached 816. However, the actual share of university users of the reactor had dwindled to about twenty-five percent, with industry and government accounting for the rest. At the same time, since the early 1980s the budget to run the Ford Reactor came primarily from the university itself with little support from the government or the AEC.</p>
      <p>In the late 1990s, with federal funding for nonmilitary nuclear research at low ebb, universities across the country began to shut down their reactors. In December 2000, University of Michigan Regents announced that because the operation continued to drain over $1 million a year from the university budget, formal processes were under way to decommission the reactor. Former university president James J. Duderstadt (who himself was attracted to the university's engineering school because of the Phoenix Project and was at the time of the announcement a key advisor to the secretary of energy and chair of the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee) began with a host of other scientists, to lobby for federal funds to keep academic reactors running.</p>
      <p>Although the Ford Reactor, a cornerstone of the Phoenix Project, was officially decommissioned in 2003, the Project itself was continued with a new purpose. In 2004, the Phoenix Project was given new life as the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute, and was charged with spearheading the University's efforts in interdisciplinary energy research, policy, and education. In their vote to broaden the Phoenix Project's charter beyond atomic energy, the University's Board of Regents expanded the Project's scope to encompass all forms of energy, and ensured the continued legacy of the Phoenix Project by noting that the Energy Institute would promote "research on the development of energy policies that will promote world peace, the responsible use of the environment, and economic prosperity."</p>

      <p>Records of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project were received in three major accessions and from three major donors: National Executive Chairman Chester Lang, 1958; Assistant Director Leonard Greenbaum, 1972; and Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project, 2000. In addition, one item, a copy of the Phoenix Project logo, was received from Jacqueline Kolle Haring in 2001. The material is described as two accessions and is primarily comprised of records related to fund-raising, research, and administrative functions. Series include files documenting the history of the project, prospects, donors, research grants, and outreach. Researchers tracking a particular topic should note that there is significant overlap between accessions.</p>
      <p>The records of the first two accessions measure three linear feet and date from 1947 to 1959. They are primarily comprised of correspondence, speeches, minutes, financial reports, and research files and are arranged into four series: Chester Lang/National Executive Chairman Files; Fund-raising Campaign; Financial Reports; and Early Research.</p>
      <p>The records accessioned between 2000 and 2001 range from 1948 to 1997 and add 46 feet of valuable and significant documentation to the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project record group. While large portions of the records relate to development and fund-raising aspects of the project, there are also important correspondence, research, and committee files. In addition, the accession includes a rich group of materials documenting the history of the project, as well as files regarding the national and international involvement of Phoenix administrators and scientists in the nuclear energy field.</p>
      <p>The records are organized into the following series: History; Minutes of Meetings; Development Topical Files; Director's Topical Files; Ford Reactor; Organizations; Prospects; Donors; Research; and Audio Materials. It is important to note that since the years covered in the development topical files and director topical files series overlap, the researcher is advised to examine both runs for material on a given subject.</p>

          <p>The Fund-raising Campaign series, 1948-1959 (1.5 linear ft.), includes records documenting the selection and workings of fund-raising efforts and administrative records of the campaign. There are also minutes, proposals, publicity materials, speeches, and mailings. In addition, there is a file of correspondence with Kersting, Brown, &amp; Co., the firm that assisted in planning and managing the campaign, and a file relating to the Dean Alice Lloyd Memorial. The Alexander G. Ruthven files in this series contain correspondence, memoranda, speeches, articles, and press releases reflecting the president's efforts on behalf of the Phoenix Project. Ralph Sawyer's file contains correspondence and memoranda. Regional files reflect the fund-raising activity in each region and contain correspondence and campaign plans.</p>

          <p>The History series, 1948-1997 (1.75 linear ft.), is an excellent source for understanding the genesis of the Phoenix Project and its evolution. A broad range of collected material provides an in-depth look into the earliest years of the project. For example, detached scrapbook pages covering the years 1947-1948 capture in reports, correspondence, press releases, and clippings, the efforts of the War Memorial Committee to envision, develop, and crystallize plans for a living memorial. Letters sent in response to a solicitation from Phoenix officials elicited various memorializing models from known figures such as E.B. White, C.S. Lewis, John Hersey, and Lewis Mumford. A letter from alumnus and Book-of-the-Month publisher Fred Smith, who proposed the concept that ultimately led to the development of the Phoenix Project, is also preserved in these files.</p>
          <p>The records include papers documenting the purpose and structure of the Committee of 100, organized to encourage key alumni to participate in the campaign, and files providing evidence of the project as precursor to the university's Development Council <title render="italic">To Evaluate the Future</title> is a portion of a 1997 committee report to the Office of the Vice President for Research regarding the future of the Ford Nuclear Reactor. The report recommended that the operation be continued until a decision to relicense or shut down is required in 2005. The series also includes background material, presentation papers tailored toward potential donors, reports, speeches, notes, press releases, radio scripts, and clippings.</p>

          <p>The Minutes of Meetings series, 1948-2001 (3 linear ft.), includes records from the earliest planning periods through the late 1980s. It is important to note that more than a year of organization and preparation preceded the launching of the original fund-raising campaign, a campaign President Ruthven called the most important project ever undertaken by the university. This planning period is well documented in meeting and committee files. In earlier years, an executive committee advised and participated in both fund-raising and research development. By 1956, these functions were divided when a continuation committee was charged with studying how to continue the project via a second fund-raising campaign. Among its recommendations was the appointment of a strong administrative board of governors and a second body to oversee the research side of the project. Records generated by the resulting Board of Governors are the best resource for gathering information on the second campaign, while Faculty Executive Committee files illuminate the development of research and academic programs during the period. (The Board of Governors was discharged in 1962, and the Faculty Executive Committee took on a more comprehensive advisory role.) The Executive Committee files include minutes from meetings, rosters of Committee members, evaluations and determinations of grant proposals, information on the status of the Ford Reactor, financial reports related to grant funding, as well as the overall operation of the Phoenix Project.</p>

          <p>The Development Topical Files series, 1948-1962 (3.5 linear ft.), although varied in content, is primarily comprised of material relating to fund-raising and development. Well documented are the various strategies developed to reach potential donors, corporate and individual. Significant files include Atom Day, The Case, Chairman's Source Book, and Presentations. Presentations are, for the most part, scripted speeches directed toward specific industries or companies. The meticulously structured nature of the campaign is evident in these files, along with files documenting the work of various committees. Correspondence, including early communications to and from Ralph Sawyer, the first director of the project, lecture notes, and conference proceedings are also contained in the series. <title render="italic">Atom Reports</title> for example, is the title of a conference held at the university in 1953 and 1954 focusing on the social impact of nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>The Director's Topical Files series, 1950-1969 (7 linear ft.), also contains a large number of development related records. More often interspersed among fund-raising related files, however, are administrative materials, proposals, and project records. Material generated from the work of various committees and subcommittees is scattered throughout the series. Significant records include papers documenting interactions with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), such as the original proposal for a nuclear reactor, access permits, contracts, licensing, general correspondence, and communications regarding the Ford Nuclear Reactor. There are also a large number of reports, both technical and administrative, and speech files. Speech files offer concise overviews of project goals as articulated to various audiences, and at the same time, illuminate the extent to which Phoenix leadership participated in outreach and advocacy aspects of the project as it evolved. The Oppenheimer file documents Robert Oppenheimer's somewhat controversial appearance in Ann Arbor to deliver the Fagerburg address in 1962. The folder holds correspondence, transcripts, and press releases.</p>

          <p>The Ford Reactor series, 1951-1970 (1.5 linear ft.), was primarily generated from the office of W.R. Dunbar while he served as reactor supervisor. Material in the series includes correspondence with director William Kerr and general correspondence relating to reactor operations. There are also operations summaries, operator training materials, reports, and notes. Operations summaries delineate the number of hours the reactor operated at various powers and the extent to which work was oriented toward teaching or toward research. The series includes a survey designed by Dunbar in 1964 to identify and describe educational, research, and industrial nuclear reactors in existence at the time in the United States. Construction related documents are also contained in the files.</p>

          <p>The Organizations series, 1955-1967 (5 linear ft.), is a valuable source for understanding the extent to which the influence of the Phoenix Project extended well beyond Michigan. The bulk of the material relates to the relationship of Phoenix personnel with the International Cooperation Agency (ICA), an arm of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Phoenix scientists provided consulting services, which included advising ICA Washington and conducting missions in the field in connection with the U.S. Atoms for Peace Program. Working closely with scientific and educational personnel in numerous countries, Gomberg, Kerr, Sawyer and others evaluated research proposals, reviewed the design of laboratories, advised on the selection of equipment, and participated in the planning of educational programs. ICA files include briefings, correspondence, itineraries, background papers, and some technical reports. The Visit Reports subseries is comprised of the more formal reports written for the ICA Nuclear Energy Program. These documents include evaluations of programs, comments, recommendations, lists of participants, resources, and sometimes photocopied photographs. There are also records relating to the Argonne National Laboratory, the Associated Midwest Universities Nuclear Engineering Evaluation Committee, and the American Nuclear Society. It is of value to note that there are additional records relating to the involvement of Phoenix staff in various organizations in the Director's Topical Files series.</p>

          <p>The Prospects series, 1947-1985 (3 linear ft.), is primarily a set of small files holding correspondence sent to or received from corporations and businesses during the course of fund-raising. Custom printed folders in this series include space for data to be entered about a company, such as location, products, university contacts, officers, and donations. Unfortunately, in many cases the forms in the folders were only slightly utilized. Nevertheless, the series provides an overview of the comprehensive character of the campaign in the corporate realm. Individuals listed in the series usually had a commercial connection or were associated with a foundation.</p>

          <p>The Donors series, 1948-1996 (3 linear ft.), includes two types of records: the Master Set of Donor Cards and the Memorial Volumes. The Master Set of Donor Cards is comprised of cards and copies of transactions for each donor, corporate and individual through 1996. The cards are arranged alphabetically and are housed in four .5 linear feet boxes. The Memorial Volumes are an undated set of seven bound books. At the time they were prepared (unfortunately unknown, but estimated to be in the late 1960s or early 1970s), they contained a complete list of individual (non-corporate) contributors.</p>
          <p>The first volume contains the names of the National Board of Officers and Sponsors, followed by a list of individual donors and the person memorialized. The next six volumes include an alphabetically arranged list of names. According to a document in the History series (Box 4, History, Background Material, Memorial Volumes in George Mason Library), the volumes were compiled from an IBM list of donors once kept in the Rackham office, title pages to each volume were hand lettered, illustrative material was prepared by Dwight Gadbery, and the list was typed by Edna Robbins on a "special IBM typewriter in 400 typing hours." The volumes were bound by the university bindery and kept in a case especially designed for them in the Phoenix library entitled "Honor Roll of Donors to the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project." Researchers should note that contributors who gave money toward cancer research were listed in a companion volume identically bound and kept in the Alice Crocker Lloyd Therapy Center. The record group does not include the Crocker volume.</p>

          <p>Collectively, the Research series, 1948-2003 (20.5 linear ft.), offers a precise and detailed view of Phoenix supported research. Records exist for all but one (# 802) of 816 funded projects, which are arranged chronologically by grant number. Included for most are the initial grant request, progress reports, and a final summary of the project's accomplishments. Frequently there are substantial final reports in the file, publications resulting from the project, and bibliographies. The series also includes a run of applications for funds arranged by year, 1948-1961; a run of applications arranged by year with accompanying evaluations and comments, 1968-1994; and a set of index cards. The index cards are arranged alphabetically by project director and include the name of the project, the amount funded, and opening and closing dates. Researchers are reminded that there is also a series comprised of early research material in the first accession, . The Research series also includes a compendium of research grants funded by the Phoenix Project since the inception of the grant award process in 1948. Additional information regarding the grant-decision making process and project evaluations can be found in the Faculty Executive Committee files in the Minutes of Meetings series.</p>
