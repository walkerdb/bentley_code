      <p>Harry Albert Towsley (1905-1993), pediatrician, professor, and philanthropist, was born September 15, 1905, in Midland, Michigan, the son of Dr. Frank A. and Harriet Sias Towsley. After graduating from Midland High School in 1922, he attended Kalamazoo College (1922-1923), Michigan State University (1923-1924), and the University of Michigan (1925-1927). In 1931, he earned his medical degree from the University of Michigan and was a member of Alpha Kappa Kappa, the professional medical fraternity. His training included stints as a rotating intern and assistant resident at the University Hospital, 1931-1933, and resident in the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases 1933-1934. He spent parts of 1933 and 1934 observing and studying pediatric facilities in Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, New York, St. Louis, and Great Britain.</p>
      <p>In 1934, he was appointed as an instructor in the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases and became assistant professor in 1941. During this time he recognized the potential value of technology in teaching and continuing education and was quick to utilize film as an educational medium, collaborating on the production of several nationally distributed films.</p>
      <p>His instructional career was interrupted by military service with the University of Michigan affiliated 298th General Hospital during World War II. The unit was activated on June 27, 1942, and spent thirty-six months overseas operating hospitals in Bristol, England; Cherbourg, France; and Liege, Belgium, before leaving Europe on September 23, 1945. Towsley enlisted as a major in 1942, and was promoted to lt. colonel, serving as chief, Division of Communicable Diseases and Chief, Laboratory Services. He was also the unit historian.</p>
      <p>Following his return from military service he assumed direction of the affiliated hospital program of the Department of Postgraduate Medicine, directing the newly developed program of decentralized graduate medical instruction and was coordinator of extramural activities. During this period he carried the dual titles of associate professor of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases and associate professor in the Department of Postgraduate Medicine.</p>
      <p>In 1954, he was named associate director of the Department of Postgraduate Medicine and subsequently became chairman in 1967, following the death of John M. Sheldon. Towsley served as chairman of the department until his retirement in 1971.</p>
      <p>Dr. Towsley was active in numerous professional organizations and civic groups. He was a fellow and diplomat of the American Academy of Pediatrics and served as chairman of the subcommittee on Postgraduate Education, and was president of the Academy during 1964-65. On the state level he was active in the Michigan State Medical Society as a member of the Iodized Salt Committee and chairman of the Committee on Postgraduate Medical Education. He was also a member of the Washtenaw County Medical Society, serving as president in 1948. In 1970, he was elected into the Michigan Health Council Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p>He also served on several boards, including the Michigan Foundation for Medical and Health Education, Michigan United Fund, and American Social Health Association. On the community front he was active as a member of the Michigan Children's Aid Society, Ann Arbor Board of Health, Ann Arbor Community Chest, and Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors.</p>
      <p>At the University of Michigan he was involved in numerous committees and organizations, including the Alumni Association, Development Council (he chaired the Foundation Relations Committee from 1973 to 1980), and the University Committee on Broadcasting, 1954-1971. Within the Medical Center he was on the Student Aid Committee, and was a member and chairman of the Audiovisual Committee, 1946-1971. He was also editor of the Medical Center Journal from 1964 to 1972.</p>
      <p>On August 14, 1932, he married Margaret Dow (1906-1994), daughter of the founder of the Dow Chemical Company. Mrs. Towsley received her bachelor degree from the University of Michigan in 1928 and a master's from Columbia University in 1930. She was a community leader whose accomplishments included election to the Ann Arbor City Council, and the founding of the Children's Play School in 1935. In 1960, the couple established the Harry A. and Margaret D. Towsley Foundation, a private charitable foundation designed to assist religious, educational, charitable and scientific organizations with their programs. The foundation also worked for the prevention of cruelty to children. The majority of the funds have been distributed in the state of Michigan, primarily in the Ann Arbor area. Among the foundation's significant donations to the University of Michigan were the Towsley Center for Continuing Medical Education, and major gifts to the Wiley T. Buchanon Research Fund and the Kellogg Eye Center. The Towsleys had five daughters: Margaret Ann (Reicker), Janice Elizabeth (Poteat), Judith Dow (Alexander), Harriet Susan (Inglish), and Grace Lynn (Hamblin).</p>
      <p>Dr. Harry A. Towsley died at his home on March 31, 1993. Margaret Dow Towsley died of a stroke May 2, 1994.</p>

          <p>Correspondence consists of chronologically arranged outgoing letters sent by Towsley to his wife and children while he was serving overseas with the 298th General Hospital. Due to censorship restrictions, these letters, covering 1944-1945, focus mainly on aspects of daily life rather than military activity. A single file of scattered incoming correspondence, 1975-1982, offers a modest glimpse into his activities during his active retirement.</p>

          <p>The Family History series offers a rich source of information on the Towsley and Sias families. Included are a variety of late 19th and early 20th century photographs of family members and friends in a variety of photographic formats (cartes-de-visites, tintypes, and snapshots). Several late 1980s photographs of Harry Towsley and his wife are also found here. Material on Wilbur D. Towsley (1897-1971), brother of Harry A. Towsley, provides insight into the life of his brother who was a physician in Midland, Michigan and includes photographs and newspaper accounts of various hunting and fishing trips, as well as information on Wilbur's estate. Other family memorabilia includes a partial 1876 diary kept by his father, Frank A. Towsley (1858-1919), and a 1901 patent for "Stream or Current Motors."</p>

          <p>The series Reunion Files consists of chronologically arranged files documenting the lives of Towsley and fellow members of the University of Michigan Medical School class of 1931. Beyond the usual reunion mechanics this series includes questionnaires (1941, 1966), correspondence, and photographs which together richly illustrated the careers and lives of this particular class.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The strength of the collection rests in the 298th General Hospital Records. These records fully document this unit from inception through deactivation. The unit's affiliation with the university is well documented through correspondence and records of the University of Michigan Affiliated Medical Unit Welfare Association. Also included are three highly detailed annual reports recounting the history of the unit from 1943 to 1945. Illustrations in these volumes combined with a collection of snapshots document all facets of life at an army hospital from the unusual to the mundane, including a series of photographs depicting the Normandy region in France in the months following the massive D-Day landings.</p>

          <p>The Films series includes 16mm motion pictures primarily taken by Towsley or produced by him for the Medical School. The films date from 1934 to 1969, and include both color and black and white footage in reel sizes ranging from a few feet to nearly 1,000 feet. The majority of the films are silent. Footage of pediatric patients, contagious disease cases, and congenital abnormalities appears to have been used for research and teaching. Subjects include the 298th General Hospital during training and deployment, pediatric patients, infectious diseases, skin diseases, a 1940 Galens parody of Adolf Hitler, and miscellaneous home movies.</p>
