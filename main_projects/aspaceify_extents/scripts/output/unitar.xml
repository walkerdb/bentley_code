      <p>In 1865, forty Ann Arborites invited Charles Brigham (1865-1877) from Massachusetts to become the first minister for the newly organized First Unitarian Church. Services were originally conducted at the old Court House but in 1867 the church purchased a building at Fourth and Ann Street. In 1882, under the ministry of Jabez Sunderland (1878-1898), a new Romanesque church was built at State and Huron Street, near the University of Michigan campus. The church would remain there until 1946 when the congregation purchased the Dr. Dean Myers home at 1917 Washtenaw Avenue. An addition was added to that residence in 1956. In 1995, the congregation began plans to build a new church, which was completed in 1999 on Ann Arbor-Saline Road at the corner of Ellsworth.</p>
      <p>Throughout its history the church has been identified with the liberal religious tradition and has maintained close ties with the university community. In the 1880s, Minister Sunderland was attracted by religious movements in India and argued strongly for Indian independence. His wife, Eliza, was one of the first women to earn a doctorate from the University of Michigan and later went on to become a prominent educator and suffragist.</p>
      <p>During the depression of the 1930s, Minister Harold P. Marley (1920-1942) was involved in a range of social issues. He was an active member of the American Civil Liberties Union and the church doors remained open for labor union meetings and controversial speakers who sometimes could obtain no other meeting place in Ann Arbor. An editorial in the student-run Michigan Daily in 1937 noted that this church is "a center of activity in behalf of true democracy . . . and a genuine force in our social thinking."</p>
      <p>During World War II, the church was involved in providing human services for the influx of workers to the Willow Run bomber plant. Gilbert House in Ypsilanti was established to meet these needs. In the 1950s, Minister Edward Redman (1943-1960) was also active in his opposition to McCarthyism through his writings and participation in various organizations.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s, the church with its new minister Erwin A. Gaede (1961-1979), supported the civil rights movement as well as the new women's movement. The Vietnam war, however, proved more divisive and eventually some members of the congregation chose to leave the church over this issue. Gaede counseled and wrote letters for those men applying for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam war, and remained visible in the community as a proponent of peace through his letters to the editors of various newspapers.</p>
      <p>During this time, as well, (1969-1971) the Black Economic Development League and the Welfare Rights Organization (BEDL-WRO) were petitioning and demonstrating in area churches in the spirit of the Black Manifesto, to the effect that traditionally white congregations owed the league and the area's poor population financial support, and demanded $10,000 in cash and $21,000 in stocks from First Unitarian of Ann Arbor. The congregation was among the first to attempt to meet the demands.</p>
      <p>In 1980, the church added "Universalist" to its name in a spirit of consolidation between two similar religious traditions. Today, the Ann Arbor church is one of 1,000 Unitarian-Universalist congregations nationally which include close to 200,000 members. In explaining the beliefs of the church, the current minister of the Ann Arbor church, Kenneth W. Phifer (1980-present) has written, "Unitarian-Universalism is a religion based on the freedom of individuals to determine their own religious understanding, tolerance of others whose conclusions are different, and dependence upon reason in considering the meaning of life. The fundamental theology is that all reality forms a unified whole to which we owe respect and love."</p>

          <p>The history of the church is well documented. The series Church History includes brief histories prepared for various events in the life of the church and two anonymous histories believed authored by former ministers. More formal histories include the 1985 account by Minister Edward H. Redman of his own ministry to the church, and a comprehensive 1990 history by congregation member Marjorie Reade entitled, "The Story of Our First Hundred Years." Included in the series material are the notes and correspondence of Marjorie Reade with fellow congregation-member Ruth Bordin concerning the history of the church, and between Marjorie Reade and Alice Sunderland Wethey, granddaughter of Minister Jabez Sunderland, concerning the history of the Sunderland family. Also included are notes and correspondence regarding the sharing of church history with other organizations, including the national Unitarian Universalist Historical Society. The series concludes with articles and letters of recognition concerning the church's 1990 125th anniversary celebration.</p>

          <p>The Church Reports series includes the Annual Reports (1948-1997), originally called Annual Proceedings, then Yearbook, which became semi-annual reports in 1974. These reports contain the minutes of the annual meeting and yearly reports from various church committees and organizations. Researchers seeking specific groups and committee reports, particularly for early organizations, should also look in the Topical Files series.</p>

          <p>Topical Files include material on various church organizations as well as important church events. "Adult Discussion Group, 1966-1970" and "Minister Review (Edwin Gaede), 1972" document the political climate of the church during the Vietnam war. "Unity Hall Lectures, 1933-1942" includes only a few copies of lectures but this file shows evidence of the wide range of labor and political groups which used the hall during this period. Surveys and questionnaires and their resulting reports can be found in the files, "Minister Search, Pulpit Committee, 1960-1961" and "Committees and Other Church Organizations, Questionnaire Committee, 1966" and in the Minister Search information packets of 1979 and 1994. These information packets were sent to prospective candidates for minister and assistant minister, respectively, and contain various publications, photographs, sermons and reports. They offer to the researcher broad overviews of the climate and activities of the church.</p>
          <p>Other church groups represented in this series can be found in the Committees subseries, including the Social Action Committee, which had a BEDL-WRO subcommittee, and the Long Range Planning Committee, also called the Development Committee. The BEDL-WRO subcommittee file contains audio tapes of the 1970 appeal to the congregation by Charles Thomas Jr. for "reparation" to African-Americans. Also included in the Committee subseries are the financial records of the Jackson Fund, a substantial endowment, made by congregation members George L. and Florence Hazelton Jackson in 1955, which has continued to provide funding throughout the years to the church via investment returns.</p>

          <p>Ministers' Files includes correspondence and sermons of Charles Brigham in the 1860s through Kenneth Phifer in the 1980s and 1990s. The files of Harold Marley (1929-1942), Edward Redman (1942-1960) and Erwin Gaede (1961-1979) are especially abundant. Minister Marley's ACLU activity and his political convictions are well documented. Minister Redman's file contains copies of sermons broadcast on local radio stations during the 1950s as well as correspondence--arranged topically--on behalf of the Fund for Religious Freedom (a group opposed to the California Loyalty Oath for Churches) and regarding the Unitarian Student Group, for example. While both the Marley and Redman files contain some information on Gilbert House and their work with families at the Willow Run bomber plant, the researcher interested in those subjects should also consult a separate collection - Willow Run Area Recreational Project. Minister Gaede's correspondence, arranged chronologically, consists of almost a foot of material. Researchers interested in material on Minister Sunderland or his wife Eliza should be aware that the Bentley Library also holds their personal collections (see Sunderland, Jabez Thomas and Sunderland, Eliza Jane Read).</p>
