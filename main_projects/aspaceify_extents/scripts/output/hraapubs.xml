      <p>The University of Michigan Personnel Office was established in 1945 to develop and implement personnel policies, administer faculty promotion and tenure-granting policies, and negotiate and monitor contracts with unionized university employees. While recommendations for faculty promotions and tenure began in the department, school, or college, the Personnel Office was responsible for conducting them to the president, the provost, and to the Board of Regents for final action. This office also maintained the official employment record for all university faculty and staff. The Personnel Office annually published salary information of all university employees. Researchers will find these listings in the University of Michigan Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action publications group.</p>
      <p>In 1972 the University of Michigan created the Affirmative Action Program to develop recruiting practices and set goals and timetables to respond to federal laws passed in the 1960s guaranteeing equal opportunity in employment to women and minorities. The first director of the Affirmative Action Program was Nellie M. Varner. Her chief responsibility was to interpret the specific guidelines of the Department of Education (Title VI, Title IX), the Department of Labor (Title IV and Title VII) and to build a structure within the university to meet these guidelines. In addition she served as a liaison between the university, federal government officials, and the university's Commissions for Minority Affairs and Women, established by President Robben Fleming in 1971. His charge to the commissions was to examine university policies, procedures, and practices which might contribute to discrimination against minority groups and women, and make recommendations. The commissions and the Affirmative Action Program worked together to develop procedures and submitted recommendations to the president to improve various programs within the university.</p>
      <p>Reorganized in 1976 the Affirmative Action Program was changed to Affirmative Action Office and the Commissions for Minority Affairs and Women were integrated into the office. The move eliminated duplication of effort and focused activity on the eradication of discriminatory practices. Gwendolyn Baker was appointed the new director of the Affirmative Action Office. In 1978 Charles Allemand replaced her as director of the Affirmative Action Office.</p>
      <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, the role of the office grew to include the protection of handicapped individuals, people between the ages of 40 and 70, and veterans of the Vietnam War. In addition, non-discriminatory policies included religion, national origin, height, weight, marital status, and sexual orientation.</p>
      <p>In 1980 Virginia Nordby became director of the Affirmative Action Office. The office was divided into compliance and programs teams, reflecting the major functions of the office, to meet federal affirmative action guidelines, and to serve the needs of groups or individuals on campus protected by nondiscrimination laws. Nordby directed both teams.</p>
      <p>The compliance team was responsible for the data retrieval, analysis, and writing the reports on minority student recruitment and retention, faculty and staff employment, and affirmative action compliance required by the university and the federal government. In addition, it monitored the race and gender composition of the faculty, staff, and student body; set affirmative action goals and followed their progress, and oversaw faculty and staff recruitment. The program team addressed the needs of members of protected groups through grievance counseling, program development, and policy recommendations. It also provided workshops to the university community.</p>
      <p>The Affirmative Action Office also worked with constituency groups, providing direct staff and financial support to such groups as the Academic Women's Caucus, the African-American Organizations Coalition, the Age Concerns Council, the Association of Black Professionals and Administrators, the Commission for Women, the Women of Color Task Force, the Men of Color Task Force, the Task Force on Sexual Orientation, and the Women's Initiative Group.</p>
      <p>In 1988 Virginia Nordby left the Affirmative Action Office. Mary Ann Swain became the interim director. In 1989, Zaida I. Giraldo became the director. In 1992, Jimmy A. Myers took over the position as Interim Director.</p>
      <p>On February 15, 1994 the Affirmative Action Office combined with the Personnel Office to become the Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action. Jackie McClain was appointed as the executive director.</p>

          <p>Unit Publications include brochures and manuals created by the Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action (and earlier Personnel Office) to assist employees in making decisions regarding health care, disability, and retirement. A variety of reports are also included, among them a 1997 self-assessment, which explains the various offices merged under the broader Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action.</p>
          <p>Although produced by a number of differently titled organizations within and outside of HRAA, the statistical resources included here contain salary and staffing figures and tables. The key publication is the annually published <title render="italic">Analysis of Salaries Paid to the Instructional Staff</title>. Based on fall term data, this publication analyzes current salaries of the university's instructional staff by department and within the department by rank. The analysis is complete from 1960 to present. Beginning with the 1989-1990 academic year graduate teaching assistants were included. The analysis lists the number of persons at each rank or level with mean, median, minimum and maximum salaries and their average age. The survey also incorporates the Dearborn and Flint campuses in its analysis. The Office of Faculty and Staff Statistics also publishes <title render="italic">Comparative Instructional Salary Data</title>, which compares the salaries of the university's academic departments with those of other universities around the country. This publication is a compilation of data extracted from the Big 10 and AAU data exchanges and surveys conducted by Oklahoma State University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The data is based on the fall term and an academic (nine month) year.</p>

          <p>Topical Publications consist of annual salary lists. These are computer printouts and digital files that are prepared and made available by the Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action in compliance with the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. They are arranged chronologically by academic year, beginning with 1979/80. Data within a given year is arranged alphabetically by employee name. Data available includes employee name, appointment title, appointing department, annual appointment period, full time pay rate, and appointment fraction. For some years the employee's date of original hire is also included. For the years 1979/80 to 1985/86 information exists only for faculty or university employees classified as professional/administrative. Subsequent lists include all university employees regardless of job classification. The printed salary lists from 2002/03 to 2008/09 have been scanned as PDF files. Beginning in 2009/10 the print copy was discontinued.</p>
          <p>The most recent salary list is added to the collection as it becomes available. Salary information for years prior to 1979/80 can be found in the records of the University of Michigan Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
