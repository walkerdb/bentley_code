    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Eric Stein was born in Holice, in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, on July 8, 1913, the son of Zikmund Stein and Herminia Zalud Stein. He received his J.U.D. from Charles University, Prague, in 1937, and his J.D. from the University of Michigan in 1942. Following service with the U.S. Army Allied Commission for Italy, Legal Subcommission from 1942 to 1946, Stein maintained a high profile in international affairs. He served with the U.S. Department of State from 1946 to 1955 and held additional positions with the U.S. United Nations delegation.</p>
      <p>In 1955, Stein married Virginia Elizabeth Rhine. In the same year, he began a long and distinguished tenure on the University of Michigan Law School faculty. After two years as associate professor, Stein was promoted to full professor in 1957. Stein's professional and legal interests kept him actively involved in international studies. He was co-director, with William W. Bishop, Jr., of International and Comparative Legal Studies from 1958 to 1976, and director from 1976 to 1981. In this capacity he promoted multi-national studies and programs, such as an exchange program for faculty and students between the University of Michigan and the Free University of Brussels, Belgium. Stein was an active participant on several university committees, and these memberships also reflect his international orientation. During his tenure, he served on the Faculty Advisory Committee on International Programs (FACIP), on the Vandenberg Lecture Committee, and with the Center for Western European Studies. His achievements have been recognized by two honorary doctorates (from the Université Libre Brussels, Belgium, 1978, and from the West-Bohemian University Pilsen, Czech Republic, 1997). He also worked to coordinate the Ford Foundation grants for International and Comparative Legal Studies at the Law School, and for over a decade wrote the Law School's submission to the university's general Ford Foundation annual reports.</p>
      <p>Much of Stein's scholarship has focused on transnational economic institutions, and on other international aspects of the law such as disarmament and weapons control. His was among the first courses in the world on the European Common Market, and students came from across Europe to the United States to take it. His published books include: <title render="italic">American Enterprise in the European Common Market: A Legal Profile</title>, editor (1960); <title render="italic">Courts and Free Markets: Perspectives from the United States and Europe</title> (1982), <title render="italic">Czecho/Slovakia: Ethnic Conflict/Constitutional Fissures/Negotiated Breakup</title> (1997), <title render="italic">Diplomats, Scientists and Politicians: The United States and the Nuclear Test Ban Negotiations</title> (1966) and <title render="italic">Thoughts from a Bridge: A Retrospective of Writings on New Europe and American Federalism</title> (2000).</p>
      <p>Stein retired from the Law School in 1983, and after being reappointed several times to teach courses, he retired for the last time in 1990, though he continues to guest lecture as professor emeritus. Stein was also invited as an advisor to the Czech and Slovak governments on issues of constitutional drafting in 1990-1993. In 2001, President Vaclav Havel awarded him the Medal of Merit First Degree for Outstanding Scholarly Achievement of the Czech Republic, and was made an honorary Czech citizen of Holice.</p>

      <p>The bulk of the Eric Stein collection relates to his research and writings, and his career as a law professor at the University of Michigan. The papers were received in two main installments, 1999 and 2007. As such, the papers are arranged and described as two separate accessions. The second installment of papers received in 2007 extends the earlier series and adds one new series pertaining to the Czech Constitution.</p>

          <p>The Biographical series (0.2 linear feet) contains biographical documents, but little of a personal nature. The majority of documents in this series are university personnel forms which Stein filled out yearly between 1958 and 1976. A few forms are missing from the series. Though the information contained in the forms is somewhat repetitive, they do provide a brief yearly synopsis of the classes Stein taught, his professional activities, and his publications. The most interesting materials in this series relate to Stein's successful application for a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1962-1963.</p>

          <p>The series Ford Foundation (0.5 linear feet, 1963-1973) documents Stein's involvement with the Ford Foundation grants to the Law School from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. For a period of ten years between 1963 and 1973, Stein compiled the annual report from the Law School to the Ford Foundation. He was also involved in budgeting grant money for professors and students who were working on projects concerned with international and comparative law. Much of the documentation for these complementary activities consists of memos and correspondence between Stein, various deans, and the rest of the law faculty. Some background materials for the university's grant proposals are included.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series is organized into two subseries, 1955-1992 and 1973-2001, reflecting the two major accessions of Stein material. Each of the subseries is arranged alphabetically by correspondent/subject and is an integration of numerous small alphabetical runs that Stein had maintained. There is some overlap in corespondents and subject matter between the two subseries.</p>

            <p>The Correspondence series (14.2 linear feet, 1955-1996) covers the years that Stein was involved with the University of Michigan, from 1955 to 1996, but the materials are not restricted to his University activities. The relationships with individuals and organizations, which he cultivated at the State Department, are represented here, as well as his Law School research and teaching, his travels and visiting professorships in Europe, and some personal matters. Correspondence with other professors with whom he worked closely on international law, such as William Warner Bishop, Jr., and Hessel Yntema, can be found here. Additional correspondence appears in the 2007 accession.</p>
            <p>This subseries is a compilation of several different runs of alphabetical correspondence, each covering a different time period. As these time periods were somewhat blurred, the correspondence has been organized into one alphabetical series. It includes such general headings as "A, 1956-1994," as well as headings for individuals. However, letters from an individual who is listed in a separate folder may also be found under the general heading. Both incoming and outgoing correspondence can be found.</p>

            <p>The Correspondence, 1973-2001 subseries (1.8 linear feet) covers the years that Stein was involved with the University of Michigan, from 1973 to 2001, but the materials are not restricted to his University activities. This subseries follows his relationships with individuals and organizations and, is tied to his research and teaching, his travels and visiting professorships in Europe, and some personal matters. Communication with other professionals in the international law field, such as Karl Rychetsky and Ulrich Immenga are located here.</p>
            <p>This series has been organized into one alphabetical series. It includes such general headings as "A, 1996-1999," as well as headings for individuals. However, letters from an individual who is listed in a separate folder may also be found under the general heading. Both incoming and outgoing correspondence can be found here. Also of note is the inclusion of materials in foreign languages. Where found, the materials and the language in which they have been written are noted on the folder.</p>

            <p>Materials in the Topical Files, 1956-1982 subseries (1.5 linear feet) relates to Stein's professional activities, including his involvement in international studies programs and committees at the University of Michigan and in conferences around the world, and his research activities. Documented here is his work to establish and maintain an international and comparative legal studies exchange program with the university and legal community in Brussels, Belgium during the 1970s. The program involved both students and faculty; the documents are mainly correspondence. Stein was also instrumental in organizing a conference for the joint European-American Study of the Role of the Judiciary, held in Bellagio, Italy in July 1979. The documents pertaining to the conference are mostly correspondence and contain proposals and responses for the focus of the conference. (The Correspondence series also includes material from the Bellagio conference.) Among the ongoing research projects represented here is Stein's work on disarmament. This series contains one linear foot of his research material, including news clippings, reports and memoranda.</p>

          <p>The series Writings (1.0 linear feet, 1954-1992) contains some of Stein's books along with correspondence and research materials. The articles and speeches are generally found in their entirety, and are occasionally supplemented by correspondence, programs, or notes. Two books of note <title render="italic">Czecho/Slovakia: Ethnic Conflict, Constitutional Fissure, Negotiated Breakup</title> and <title render="italic">Thoughts From a Bridge: A Retrospective of Writings on New Europe and American Federalism</title> are heavily documented here, as they are cumulative works of Eric Stein's complete career.</p>

          <p>The Czech Constitution, 1990-2002 (1.2 linear feet) series documents the creation of the Czech Constitution of 1990 and Eric Stein's contributions. The series contains working drafts of the constitutions, Elster Reports I-III, and meeting materials from three main meetings of the constitutional committee. This is a rich series of materials and showcases the development of a modern democratic constitution echoing many post-Soviet concerns. The collection also contains constitutional drafts from Václav Havel and the Civic Forum.</p>
